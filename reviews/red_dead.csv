Some say it’s slow but I think it’s great. When doing a story line of course it’s not going to be fast paced.
The action alone should replace that.
The only reason for 4/5 stars is that nowhere did it say I needed a PSN subscription in order to play online. So that completely sucks. I don’t want another subscription in my life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

A must buy game.","March 14, 2019","An amazing game! I played RDR and loved it as well. This game has so many added bonuses and extras that the original didn't. People complain about the map being too big, too long to skin animals, cleaning and upgrading weapons/gear/upgrading camp and horses. It's not that difficult to be honest. Yes, it can be a bit overwhelming for the first 4 or 5 hours but playing this game makes time fly by. John Marston was cool in RDR but Arthur Morgan is a legend.

You can either either try to make the ~$500 you need to buy a pistol by taking 13 cents at a time off each bandit you kill or use gold which you can purchase for real money.  I paid 22 gold or approximately $10 for one gun.  The game cost me $55.  I decided that I would also purchase a saddle for my horse.  They have a panther saddle that opens up at level 91.  The game was showing the option to buy it at my level of 30 using ""Rank Up gold"" at a price of 18 gold bars.  I clicked BUY and the game transferred me to the Playstation Playstore to buy more gold.  I purchased $19.99 worth (55 gold bars) and then returned to the game where the saddle was no longer available to purchase.  I rebooted the game several times to no avail.  I contacted customer support and got an auto response.  They never bothered to make good on the purchase.  Now I am stuck with 55 gold bars and nothing I want to spend them on.  The online version has been very buggy.  I have been in countless competitions where I am doing well when I am suddenly disconnected from the server.  This is annoying enough but I really don't appreciate errors where I purchase gold to buy something and then I am told I can't buy it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I loved the first Redemption but this game is NOT on that level. Graphics look good! There’s a ton of missions but most are boring. The characters are weak and don’t draw you in like Marstons story. I’m 35 hours in but I don’t know how much more of my life I can waste on this game.
Update: I completed the game and bumped my rating up. The game does get better but it takes a long while! Scenery is gorgeous and missions are plentiful. There is a lot of glitches and the horse is clunky at times. I’m glad I stuck with it, but glad it’s over. There was a lot of crafting/customizing/upgrading to do but I passed on a lot of it. It was either too complicated or just wouldn’t work. Honestly, they tried cramming too much into the game.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you're willing to buy into the simulation aspects of the game, and happen to love the Old West, you will forgive the game it's foibles here and there. I spent a lot of time just ""out"". Riding trail, breaking horses, hunting. The really ""emergent"" experience in the sense of interacting with the game's systems to find my entertainment. Not that the quests aren't good. The main story line is fine, though there's some cliche moments there where I deeply wanted to smack Arthur, but it all comes together well at the end. The side quests are where the really good stuff's hiding though. There's a couple quests where you hang out and hunt with an old Civil War vet that really stood out in my mind in particular. There's also some sillier stuff like you'd expect from Rock Star hiding out there.

For those of you who want to enjoy more about the West, or have found a new interest in gunslingers, I strongly suggest the book Triggernometry by Eugene Cunnigham, which is filled with first hand accounts of some of the larger than life legends, good and bad, that populated the real American West.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_133?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=133&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Slow pacing

Any AAA action adventure or RPG game today should have impactful character/weapon upgrades, some sort of meaningful skill progression, and an inticing loot system that grabs your interest. These essential elements are all shoved to the back seat in RDR2.

Far cry 5 has it
God of war has it
Horizon zero dawn has it
Fallout 4 has it
Witcher 3 has it

The list goes on and on...

Rdr2 does not really have it.

*update*
As an rpg fan, I have no qualm with 60-100 hour games, but I had to move on from rdr2.
I did get into the story despite the slogging gameplay. But i could just not bring myself to finish the game. By chapter 5, I was tired and done with the slog. I have other games to start. I read a story summary and watched ending vids on youtube. Moving on now. It's too bad. It was just 10-20 hours too long for no good reason.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_125?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=125&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I loved the RDR when it came out and have been counting down the months for RDR2.  I was so excited, I actually went out and bought a PS4 just to play this game (I'm normally more of a PC gamer).

25 hours into it, I gotta say, I am incredibly disappointed.  Over and over again, I find myself recalling Far Cry 2.  That was a really incredible game with SO many positives qualities, but ultimately a flawed and disappointing production.  For those that don't know, Far Cry 2 created a vast open world, good story, great immersion, and quality game play...with annoyance after needless annoyance that just sucked the joy out of it.  In Far Cry 2, if you run for more than a few seconds you get out of breath and slow to a crawl.  You had to take malaria pills constantly or you'd get sick and stumble around.  You couldn't fast travel and had to drive literally everywhere in lousy cars that were slow and boring.  Bad guys attacked you constantly and respawned, making your constant treks across the wilderness feel like massive chores instead of fun action sequences.

With RDR2, it's like none of the developers paid any attention to all the failures of Fry Cry 2.  Indeed, it's like they went double-down on all the annoying aspects of that game, while tossing in a few more for good measure.  The most frustrating thing about this, is that--like Far Cry 2, there's actually an amazing game underneath the stupidity.  The soundtrack, graphical design, and character acting are all exceptional.  The story and characters seem pretty good so far and I really do enjoy exploring and doing all the things the game offers.  The sense of exploration is incredible and the detail and hard work put into making the world seem real and alive is really commendable.  On the other hand, the game team seems to have decided that more ""realism"" also meant the inclusion of boring chores and animations.

Video games are, in general, ""simulations"" (sims) of something.  RDR2 is a simulation of cowboy life.  All sims struggle with how far they want to go in simulating real life, but most seem to understand that the key is simulating the ""fun"" parts, while ignoring or vastly underplaying the ""chore"" or ""boring"" aspects.  The ""fun"" parts of being a cowboy include gunfights, racing around on a horse, hunting, fishing, robbing banks, quickdraws, etc.  Things that could be a novelty the first few times include realistic depictions of things, like skinning an animal, eating, brushing your horse.  The first few times you see it, you think, huh, it's cool how realistic they made that.  Then you realize you have to see them over and over and over again.  Worse, they are mandatory!  You have to eat in this game to survive.  You have to hunt to eat.  You have to skin the animals to get the meat to eat.  You have to brush and feed and compliment your horse to keep it happy.  You have to cut your hair, change your clothes, and bathe.  On and on, the game literally gives you ACTUAL VIRTUAL CHORES to do -- that you MUST do -- just to play the game.  Adding to this, they make all these things take FOREVER!  The animation for looting a dead bad guy takes 5 seconds.  If you have a shootout and kill 30 guys and want to loot them all, expect to spend about 3 minutes doing nothing but watching the same painfully slow animation over and over again.  5 seconds doesn't sound long until you play the game and realize what a stupid amount of time is literally wasted.  That is just one example.  In RDR, I thought the time spent depicting animal skinning was just about right.  It was long enough to convey the point and hint at being annoying, but not enough to actually be annoying.  With RDR2, they were like, nope!  Let's turn it into the most laborious activity possible and make sure our players know EXACTLY how real cowboys skinned animals! It's so painful it's just stupid.  You kill the animal, then find the animal, then walk around it trying to get the controls to notice it, then skin it.  That animation takes FOREVER.  Do I really need to see exactly how to skin an animal in real life?  Really?  Then after you skin the animal, you still have to carry the skin over to the back of your horse and drop it off.  After that, you have to go back to the now-skinned-animal, pick it up, and then stash it on your horse.  The whole process just feels agonizingly slow and pointless.  This is exacerbated by the painfully wonky controls and then multiplied even more by how SLOW everything in the game.  Horses run painfully slow and get exhausted way too fast, slowing you down even more.  The map is massive, but there is no fast travel so it means you just spend hours doing nothing but running back and forth trying not to killed in the process.  I literally find myself avoiding doing ""fun"" things like gunfights and stuff because I know I'll have to stop and set up camp and eat and rest just so I can continue on my way afterwards.  It makes everything just feel like a big painful chore.  The NEEDLESSNESS of it all is what annoys me the most.  Why are players forced to walk at a snail's pace through camp?  Why do we have to see the animation every single time the player loots someone in such laborious detail?  I know they emphasized realism and I do appreciate that...for the first few hours.  After that, I just want to have fun and enjoy a cowboy ""sim"".  That's what RDR was.

Why not just give the option to skip animations like other games?  Or show the animation the first few times and then make it an option?  Why not speed it up a bit?  They actually do this for things like eating, which goes pretty fast.  Why not for skinning animals or looting bad guys?  Why am I more concerned about how much food my underweight character is eating or how dirty he is instead of how I'm going to take down the next group of bad guys or what gun I get to carry?  It's not fun worrying about feeding, bathing, cleaning, grooming, dressing for the right weather, etc, or at least not constantly.  Make those things optional or at least much less important--even vital--for the game to be played.  Make bonding with your horse by brushing, feeding, and being nice to them an optional or occasional thing, not something you have to do constantly just to keep them alive and running!  I know it's realistic.  I get it.  That's not the point.  Clearly, the game makers were fine ditching realism for some things, like the insane amount of bottles and cans you can carry around, or not making us watch the character relieve himself.  So if they are fine breaking reality for some things, why insist on it for all these others?

RDR2 is just a shameful waste of an amazing opportunity.  Like Far Cry 2, this was a ""should have been great"" that killed itself with it's own stupid adherence to realism at the expense of fun.  That said, if they could patch the game and fix some of these things, I absolutely think the game would be a 5 star favorite of mine.  As is, I'm pretty much ready to sell it back to Amazon.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_123?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=123&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pro:  Graphics – Score: 5 out of 5
  Stunning graphics that really take you for a ride. When I have free time to play, I flip on the game and the first screen when you start is usually stunning visual. I'm 40 something and some of the views and locations bring me back when I was a kid, fishing or hunting with family. The graphic really takes you there.

 Story – Score: 5 out of 5
  OK. Some find this boring. I find it real. It's the turn of the century. Taking your horse places WAS what you had to do. There are stagecoaches and trains, but those are marked on your calendar AND it does cost money.  I believe this gives it a really good touch of the time.  Heck, I spent 2 weeks in Story 2 just because I liked hunting and fishing. I only went to Story 3 because I already had all the guns I was allowed to have and could only get some new ones in Story 3.  That being said, the story mode of the game is complex and quite long. At times, it can get tiring to ride your horse clear across the map to get somewhere, BUT, that is what makes it authentic. I really get the feeling that I'm investing a lot into Arthur Morgan and hearing him speak and interact is quite enjoyable. The unknown side missions that sort of come out of no where is a nice touch. I can say I'm in no rush to finish this game. In a way, after the wife and kids are asleep, I find this game very soothing AND allows me to think of where to take my kids camping next year.

Pro/Con Mix:
 Dead Eye – 4 out of 5
  As some have mentioned, there are cases in dead eye where you can mistakenly target NPC or a horse, but I've started following what some on youtube have been suggesting, which is target first, dead eye, and then shot. Otherwise, dead eye is still fun and sorta g-d like.

Con
 Controls – Score: 3 out of 5
  Man, this is my only gripe and it's not all that bad. They are working on it, but given the controls are sorta the core of the game, there are some challenges, but they aren't awful as some of said. It's not as great as....say.....The Witcher 3, but they aren't as worse as.......any number of games out there.  It takes a little to get used to, but once you get it, its ok. So middle of the road for me.

Overall: Score – 4 out of 5
 The controls are the only ding. Otherwise, I've caught my kids playing the game as well and their character just fishing or hunting. Not even playing the story. Just doing their own thing. There other games they are shooting and killing at will. Heck, I bought them Fallout 76 and they ditched that after the second day and went back to RDR2.  So in that, if I could give 4.5 stars, I would.

The controls take a little bit get used to, but unless you are completely uncoordinated and have never played a video game they become second nature. The map is awesome, and the detail from the snow to the trees and the scenery makes riding the horse even more fun. The audio is really great from the sound effects and all the different dialogue from the characters makes it feel like the environment is really alive. The voice overs and writing are well done. The story is great and the variety of missions and different activities keeps it interesting.

You don’t have to do the different survival things like cooking, hunting, changing your clothes or do all the different crafting unless you really want to. I don’t notice it making a huge impact on me completing missions. The biggest thing you need is food for Health if it gets low in battle or tonics to boost dead eye.

Like all Rockstar games it’s the personality of the characters, the variety of the missions, the gameplay of those missions, and finding cool new things on the map that make this an amazing game. Even if they didn’t have all the side activities like hunting, playing poker, searching for cigarette cards, or just taking care of your camp it still has everything that has made Rockstar games awesome. It’s well worth the money and after you play it for a couple hours you will get used to the controls and the different screens.

So far 5* for RDR2. So how can we go down to 3* from here?? Well, after a variety of impressions you start to focus on the game itself. And you realize that the style of missions hasn't really changed ever since GTA 3! Travel to the starting point. Cut scene. Travel somewhere (in this case horse riding, which is slow). Then usually shoot a few fellers. Alternatively, in case that's too exciting, catch a few fish or buy something from a store (really??). Then travel back. And if that doesn't sound boring enough, one has to know that most missions are really easy. Ok, fair enough you think. It's an open world game after all, so let's try some side missions or the hyped interactions with the world, which are supposed to have quite an influence on your further game. But well, most side missions are like all other missions. Except even more boring (catch a horse with your lasso) and usually even easier (calm down horse, walk horse back to owner, get a hint from its owner for ... well, another side mission). So then you try to interact with people in the open world. Hey, you can call out and greet. But well, almost everybody has a generic reply and there is nothing that you can do. Or you can set camp and maybe craft something. But again, the results are not very exciting or helpful for further gameplay, so I ignored that rather quickly. So what's you last resort in a Rockstar open world game? Well, you stir up some trouble. You can easily spot camps by their fire smoke, and roughly 50% you find a hostile gang there. And you want to find out how the AI got smarter here. 5 years after GTA5 and such a massive game, you'd expect something here, right? Well, once you shot at them or something, they seem to always see you. So hiding in the bushes and sneeking around them or so doesn't help, because they would always attack you no matter what. So you can just attack them straight forward, maybe seek some cover behind a rock. They are not smart enough to try to circle or flank you either, again it seems like almost nothing has been done since GTA3. Well, I'm about 35% through the story and I will continue and see how far I get. But I have to say I'm already quite bored. Then move on to the next game I guess. What a disappointment this game is!","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_139?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=139&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Surreal. As. All. Giddy. Up.

The actualization of playing this game is like finding a mythical creature. At this point----I've basically mythologized it. It almost felt as if this day would never come. But it has...and I feel like an 8 year old on Christmas morning. Why 8? Because that's how long I've been waiting. The amount of dopamine and epinephrine that was produced from seeing the home screen for the first time almost exceeds grabbing a hold of my first pair of ACTUAL ta ta's on an ACTUAL girl. Is that sad? Maybe. But it's the truth. I've never felt this way over a game (much less anything else really). Rock* has achieved so much. What we have here is something that's really special. It's something that needs to be treasured. When you play this game------you're having a brush with greatness. You'll always remember what was going on in your life when you played this game for the first time. Future playthroughs will send you back to the here and now. Treasure these moments. They will one day be fondly remembered as the good ole days. Right now...the here and NOW is the good ole days. Don't let it slip by without realizing that. It's not ""just a game"". It's so much more. It's an event.

I salute you Rock*.

Bravo.

Now, I must return to the old west. Brothels need to be visited, banks need robbing and horses need to relieve themselves at the most awkward of moments. Plus, that whisky ain't gonna drink itself.

PS: I'll add my technical thoughts (in regard to mechanics and graphics) at a later date. But, I can tell you this: on the Xbox One X it's the first game that looks and performs JUST like a PC game. I kid you not: this game is gorgeous. My wife is playing it on the PS4------don't get me wrong: the game still looks phenomenal-----but not to the degree that it does on the X. The One X was made for this game. This game was made to be experienced on the X. I'm not saying this to perpetuate the toxic tribalism of blind fanboyism----I'm saying this because it's a fact. I LOVE both Xbox and PlayStation. But, a fact is a fact.  Stay tuned for more.

November 28th update:

I've been playing it since the 26th. I have 300+ hours into it and it feels as if I've only played 20 hours. I'm not sick of ANY of the formulaic elements whatsoever. It STILL feels organic. That is a landmark achievement in gaming. It's uncanny. I've since purchased Hitman and Odyssey and just cannot bring myself to leave RDR2. I'm still playing as Arthur (but I think it's getting close to the end). This is the best game of all time. This is indisputable.

EDIT: I finished Arthur's story 20 min after writing my update. If you were able to hold back tears-----you're a stronger man than me (even if you're a woman). I'm glad I was alone. Dang you Rockstar. Dang you. Emotions were stirred that I didn't even know I had. 😢 But it was SO SO SO SO good.

With all sincerity and not a speck of melodramatic intent: Arthur Morgan inspired me to be a better man. I'm still in disbelief that a video game character has had this effect on me. It's truly surreal. This game was a bona fide morality tale that simply dripped with philosophical implications that has been translated into my day to day reality. RDR2 isn't something YOU play-----IT plays YOU. This wasn't just another game-----it was a spiritual experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_129?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=129&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Yes Atrhur doesnt control and move like Kassandra from Assasins Creed Odyssey or girl from Horizon Zero Dawn, but hes not an assassin either. Hes an outlaw who's in his late 30s or mid 40s. The entire point of this game is your trying to live and survive in this wild country where the world is becoming more civilized and you want to be free from all of that. The game itself is unbelievable in every category. I spent 5 hours hunting the other night. I tamed a wild horse (White Arabian). I've gone treasure hunting finding a few gold bars along the way.  Chapter 2 is essentially a tutorial in some parts teaching ypu how to traverse and succeed in this huge beautiful wild wild country. R* outdid themselves and somehow managed to blow my expectations out of the water. I love GTA games but Read Dead has always been my favorite. I prefer the slower pace and enjoying being an outlaw/cowboy. Voice acting and story is top notch. Arthur is by far my favorite R* character and maybe my favorite of all time. He has so much depth and feels grounded and real in that world. Do yourself a favor and buy this now. It takes a few hours to get going but the story really draws you in and before you know it its 4am and you've been playing for 8 hours straight.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_130?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=130&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I can tell that the environment graphics were top focus, even to the smaller details. It's a lot of fun and not as hokey as some past rock star games. I didn't think that they could out-do themselves from their last GTA game but RDR2 is very subversive and  gritty. The only thing I wish they put more time into would be their weapon system. I would have loved to see more mechanical configuration capabilities since during those historical times weapons were big business and there were tons of modifications and prototypes back then.

Its been a while since I've played a game that was so well put together,  honestly I wasn't even really planning on getting red dead redemption 2 also know as (RDR2).  What pulled me into getting it was how detailed they made everything, the weapon loading animations, crafting system, the animations with the animals extremely detailed and realistic, and a gripping plot; there are a few things that aren't as realistic such as the dead eye mechanism but thats pretty small compared to the rest of the game.  I've spent about a good 60+ hours playing the game, that includes main missions and side missions. and have finally completed the game and the epilogues but there still quite a bit for me to do though; a few more side missions, challenges, and compendium challenges left for me. I like to leave no stone unturned and complete the game 100%. I did only buy the regular edition of the game however; now I wished I would have gotten the deluxe edition since I enjoyed the game so much.
Con: You have to pay an extra $20 for a couple of extra missions and some costumes.  Missions that were already in the base game but the company decided to put up a paywall to block content for those who don't wanna fork over some more cash. Skins (costumes) are one thing I can understand but cutting missions from the base game is where I personally draw the line.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_132?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=132&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The game is pretty to look at, for about 30 minutes. Unless you are really into sightseeing in video games, the pretty graphics just fade into background. It's 2018 after all, nearly every game is pretty to look at.

The characters are just ok, I find Dutch more of an interesting character than the main protagonist Arthur. The rest of the gang are just forgettable. Most of the time it's hard to even tell who is talking. The subtitles don't help either: They don't include names. BTW Arthur looks so pedestrian without his hat, which he loses every time he gets in a fight. Please put a hat on him at all times!

The combat feels like a copy and paste from GTA V. Auto aiming is on by default. Shooting doesn't feel satisfying. most of the time you just press aim and shoot, and the enemy dies, no aiming needed. But some times key friendly NPCs will get killed out of nowhere, making you restart the checkpoint. Annoying.

Other things: the game is... slow. The guy walks like a turtle. Seriously every video game character needs to be running by default. Why is every interactive option at the bot-right corner? It's distracting and hard to see! I still haven't figured out the Horse inventory system, seems unnecessarily complicated. The icons for inventory items, they all look the same. Getting on a horse and get going feels clunky, clunkier than Witcher 3. Horse keeps tripping over things if I take a shortcut.

I don't know much about the story yet and I will probably not find out. I only get to play about an hour or two per day, and I can't play this when the kids are awake (and I have to sleep too), Ultimately, there is so much in the game to do, but I find myself lack of interest of continuing after just chapter 2.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_122?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=122&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Was not prepared for how spectacular this game is. I can't wrap my head around all the hate reviews this game has on amazon. I'll agree that the controls are a bit clunky and some of the animations get old but I feel like many of them will be nonexistent in multiplayer (such as skinning animals, searching bodies, etc.).

The world and the story crafted within are some of the most memorable things in gaming for me. I don't want to spoil anything but sh*t gets real around chapter 5. I haven't made it to the end yet but the story is definitely my favorite of all the Rockstar games, even surpassing the Witcher III in my opinion. Open world games have become so generic over time but R* really shed some blood, sweat, and tears over this game.

With all that said, I'm excited to finish the story and start a new game before Online beta starts. This game has convinced me to reinstate my Playstation+ membership and buy any DLC that comes out afterwards (excluding microtransactions).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_137?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=137&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But despite all of these apparent achievements, the game is ultimately boring. Even if you focus on the main story line, you have to trudge through huge gaps of redundancy. I am halfway through the main quest, so I feel like I've given this game a fair chance. But, it feels more like a chore than fun.

It takes its sweet time to get going, holding your hand every step of the way.  The way it plays and controls is very lumbering, slow, clunky and sluggish.

Its like they wanted to just make some high art movie, taking itself so seriously. GTA IV had the same issue(making it more grounded and presenting its more realistic story), which they corrected with GTA V. Fun story, but also bombastic and over the top fun gameplay. Red Dead is sooo boring. Its not a lot of fun just trotting on a horse from Point A (mission giver) to point B (Mission location) and two characters ramble and chit chat. Its like I'm listening to some radio drama show instead of playing a game. Red Dead Redemption 1 cut to the chase and got things going much faster and was much more lean and mean. Sure there's a million things to do in Red dead 2, but the core gameplay itself is underwhelming, and no game can stand on a broken foundation.

If you are expecting the fun and wild ride of GTA V, you will be sorely disappointed with Red dead. Its totally different and I would recommend watching some long play videos before buying so that you get a better idea of what you are getting in to.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_135?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=135&reviewerType=all_reviews"

  - If you love taking your time and enjoying realism then this game is for you.
  - The story, characters, and overall environment is A+ material.
  - There's so much detail that I don't think I will ever be able to fully appreciate all the time it took to make this game
  - Arthur is my favorite protagonist because of how authentic of a personality he is.

Cons
  - I have to live in chapter 3 of the game and no further because I personally refuse to emotionally deal with how the game leaves you later on. ( this means you wont have access to a good bottom portion to the map but im ok with it )
  - The online isn't as engaging as single player and I can't quite figure out why. ( could be getting shot all the time by strangers )

Overall, I really like how when you decide to pick up an apple, Arthur reaches out, picks it up, and places it in his satchel. Same thing with getting off and on the horse or hitching it.. It makes me feel like I can actually role-play as a cowboy. The pace of the game is a very subjective topic and personally I think its perfect, but if I were a GIVE IT TO MEH NOW LETS BLOW SH** UP kind of guy then I think I would hate it.
It's worth a buy in my opinion and will be one of my favorite escapes for when I feel like I want to go Westworld for awhile.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Over time I softened my view of this game.  I eventually got better at, for example, fighting from horseback.  But what helped more was just reaching a critical mass of more options of what to do.  The main story takes a *long* time to pick up speed, and is prone to redundancy.  For example, Arthur is subjected to repeated, lengthy diatribes about his seeming lack of loyalty.  But it did reach a tipping point where I wanted to keep playing.
***

Like some of the other recent reviewers I have to categorize this game as almost impossibly boring.  Long hours riding your horse from place to place.  Just riding.  Get to where you're headed, watch some canned dialog, then mount up again and follow someone off on some mission.  For a real thrill, pick up someone from the side of the road and take them on your horse somewhere way off of your path.

Technically and creatively it's very well done.  The graphics, the voice acting, the attention to detail of things like the numerous weapons you can purchase are all very good.  Plus the game seems very stable.  I don't think it's locked up on me yet.

The combat is a bit frustrating.  On story missions it's usually fairly manageable, but the random encounters can go horribly wrong quickly.  If I'm on horseback I've learned to flee from the gunfights, dismount (horsed combat is brutal), then go back on foot to challenge your enemies.  If you're killed you re-spawn and can't find those same enemies.  So, you can't even get revenge or try that same fight again.  You simply missed your chance.  Plus, as others have noted you can accidentally do damage, assault someone, even steal something without meaning to.  Once you do you have a bounty and life gets annoying.  And expensive.

I'll probably keep playing, but unlike other games where I find myself putting hours and hours into it, it's all too easy to put this game down and do something else.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Discs","Boring gameplay, bad economy, poor design","December 7, 2018","As many other reviewers have pointed out, the gameplay is dull.  There's a lot of traveling over a huge map to get from Point A to Point B, typically for a reward in game money that is worth far less than the time you spent on the mission.  Everything worth buying is too expensive.

The poor design of character interaction is what made me quit.  Brushing too close to another character, even in town, can cause them to attack you.  They can kill you without consequence.  If you attempt to defend yourself, however, the law will come for you quickly and other townspeople will even join in the attack against you.  There is no logic to this and it often requires a level of delicacy in moving your character around that one should not have to deal with in a town setting.

There's a lot to do in the game, but you'll often wind up asking yourself why you should do it, and what the point of doing it is.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I am about 10 hours in, and it has been a great game living up to the standard Rockstar quality.  The main issue is- on PS4 Pro, this is a total let down performance wise.  Extremely blurry, non-sharp graphics.  Weird depth of field issues, etc.  This is crazy to me, as PS4 was the ""lead platform"" for this game.  Most games use the fake 4K ""checkerboarding"" on the PS4 Pro to make the game look significantly better than the 900p-1080p performance you are going to get from the standard PS4.  Something went wrong in this game, and it looks pretty terrible.  Hopefully this will be patched by Rockstar somehow.  I will probably plow through the game and sell it, while the resale value is high, and maybe play it again if/when it comes out on PC.  Pretty disappointed, as I purchased the PS4 Pro bundle to play this game (and of course a handful of PlayStation exclusives), and the experience with Red Dead Redemption 2 has been far from the ""4K experience"" I was hoping for.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_127?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=127&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This game is slow, but that’s on purpose. You quickly gain a fast travel map that lets you go to ever major place and, although it’s  not the instant teleport we’re used to, it cuts down on the monotonous traveling immensely. Other than that, it does take slightly long than I’d prefer to skin animals and loot items in the wild.

But aside from that, the world and graphics are the best I’ve ever seen. The setting is absolutely magical and the way the weather changes with the climate is incredible. I’m not even halfway through and I’m already devastated that it has to end at some point.

Online is coming but I don’t care; I could hunt and fish all day and lose track of time the way I did back in the PS1/PS2 days. This is everything the last 5-6 years of gaming have missed by overly investing in gimmicks and online play. I am so glad there’s still a market for the single player game because this is, overall, the best experience I’ve had since Skyrim.

I read all kinds of tips and starter ideas that help the game not be so terribly boring at the beginning.  After completing the main story I am so sorry I ever wasted my time and money on this game.
Like I'm sure you've read from every good review, this game is massive and there's a lot you can do.  Graphics are amazing, and the environment is downright awesome.
Where the game really falls apart is simply in gameplay.  As many others have said it's very disjointed.  Things like trying to pick up an item and not the dead body next to it can be downright frustrating on a constant basis.  Running, riding your horse and the likes are about as far from smooth as it gets.
Unlike a lot of reviews have said, there is a method for fast travel.  Not just coaches and trains, you can unlock fast travel from your camp, BUT ONLY FROM YOUR OWN CAMP (and not back again).  This means you will spend hours and hours travelling from one place to another with nothing to do.  There is plenty if stuff in between but sometimes you just need to get somewhere with no interruptions, and you can't.  You can auto pilot from one place to another but you need to pay attention you can't just leave your controller while you go cook dinner or something.  Sometimes your horse goes the wrong way sometimes you get robbed and killed.  One time while in the cinematic auto pilot my horse ran into a prisoner stage coach so when I got back I was dead and had a bounty!  So you have to constantly pay attention even when auto piloting from one place to another.
Maybe my most hated of all things is the 'save feature' You can manually save games but it's not anywhere near up to date.  If you save right before a big fight or tracking a legendary animal and go back to the save feature, often it will be nowhere near where you saved the game.  Items you didn't use will have been used up, animals will be gone and items not accessible.  Absolutely awful.  The story could have been written by any moron.  It's completely linear with very little options for you to make you own choices.  Even without spoilers it's so easy to tell when you're going to be betrayed or robbed or do something dumb, but you can't do anything else!  The idea for stories with your own options has been around since before the first RDR and now seven years later they haven't fixed anything, great job rockstar!  I played games in the early 2000s where you could affect your own ending based on the decisions you make and somehow rockstar is almost 20 years behind in their gameplay design.  They only care about putting out a game people will buy, not a game people will love.

Overall the main problem is simply that the game is disjointed and slow.  It's meant to be an immersive experience but it's just not because of all the control problems and the MASSIVE amounts of downtime.  As my girlfriend put it so well, this is much more like a very boring movie than a video game.  Buy this game if you must, but even if you really like it you will quickly be made aware of it's very many flaws.

WARNING BELOW ARE GAME SPOILERS!!!!!!
I am only including these because if I had known about this stuff I never would have wasted my money in the first place.

On top of the very linear story line, you can't make any decisions at all.  That was fine for a game 20 years ago but this is 2018.  You have to kill tons of people and betray half the people in your group.  You have to go along with missions you know will get you betrayed and wanted by the law.  And the best part of all you have to get betrayed by the leader of your gang and die in the end no matter what choices you try to make.  There is only one ending to the game which is absurd in this day and age.  The *best* part of all this is that half the map doesn't even open up until you character dies.  The are a lot of missions and challenges you can't even access until the main story is done.  All that character customization you spent hours on and the challenges and the good vs evil decisions you make at every turn mean absolutely nothing since your character dies and you're forced to play the end of the game as the character from the first red dead.  I will never buy another rockstar game again as they've shown they're incapable of making progress and keeping up with the times.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_126?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=126&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I had to write a review here even though my purchase was initially for XBOX ONE,
i have recently switched my gaming to PLAYSTATION 4 and i am loving it.
So i had to buy the game again from another shop as i brother carried the XBOX ONE S away
Now RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2 is a solid game easily one of the best i have ever played.
WOW!!!
The game starts slow obviously for such a big game they have to start somewhere and give you some background of all the characters involved.
So i played through that and it was very intersting like watching an old western movie just that you are part of the movie...
The negative reviews about this game i cannot understand, everything is realistic in the game,shoot someone in the leg and they will continue to limp away till you catch up to them(i mean you want to shoot someone in the leg for him to die??),run too fast for long you lose your breath,
weather tooo cold get inside or the cold can cause your stamina to drop
what were these goons expecting from this game?
its very realistic and you cannot go guns blazing around
Its not Call Of Duty
my goodness i cannot wait to go back to the Redemption world
really solid game
Get this game and get The Witcher 3 Game Of The Year Edition plus God Of War
Christmas toast to you all","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_137?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=137&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The drunk mission with Lenny is un-expected, insane and funny as hell. The pig-couple was awesome as well.
The scenery is gorgeous but it gets a bit repetitive also.
BUT---
For most missions, you must ride your horse for a good 10 minutes to get to the ""quest giver"", (most of the time with a one-sided conversation about nothing the WHOLE freaking time) then your quest will invariably involve riding your horse half-way back across the map from where you just came, usually involve an ok cut-scene followed by a shootout, then you ALWAYS have to ride your horse back to a final location.
So to put it simply, 20 minutes of horse-riding through repetitive (but pretty) scenery, 3 minutes of cut-scenes, and 3 minutes of gun-fighting.
This wouldn't be as bad if there was something exciting about riding your horse, but you literally just pump the X-button, and try not to crash your horse (which he will do a lot if you hit a stump or tree).
The other major let-down is the music, RDR1 had some AWESOME western guitar music that could have come out of Clint Eastwood film, this doesn't have that very often.
The controls are a little clunky, and the menu crafting is also clunky.
Overall, not up to RDR1, worth a playthough though if you are a fan and have the time, but this is not the masterpiece I was hoping for.
(also if I want to boil coffee, wipe my gun for two minutes straight, and shave-- I already do that- it's called REAL life! ;)
And the BIGGEST problem maybe all the button hold downs required (instead of just selling something for instance you have the hold the x button down for about 1.5 seconds- which gets REAL OLD after awhile. This was poor choice for game mechanics.)","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_134?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=134&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, this game is just... not fun. At all.

It's technically impressive - the world is a gorgeous depiction of American heartland, the mechanics are all very well-engineered. However, therein lies the issue. This game sacrifices any sense of fun for immersion. Actions take a long time to complete as your character goes through an entire, realistic animation of picking up a can of biscuits or pulling the cork out of a bottle of rum before drinking it. Traveling by horse takes an incredibly long time and takes up most of the hours you'll be putting in this game. For something you do incredibly often, horseback combat is miserable. You have to hold X to keep the horse running, you have to hold the aim button, you have to steer the horse while looking behind you, as they don't follow trails except in the ""cinematic camera"", and you have to fire and reload. Miserable.

This game could be accurately summed up as riding your horse a long distance from camp, shooting some people, and riding your horse back to camp. It should be titled ""Cowboy Simulator 2018"" because that's about the sum of it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Oh yeah, and poker. Aside from that this game is just not what I wanted it to be. I've never played a game that just FELT so bad. The combat is not rewarding, becomes boring after a couple hours. You are not given many compelling reasons to use any methods other than shooting baddies in the head, and the more fun methods of combat are severely underpowered in comparison, leaving one logical choice for engagement with enemies. The save system is extremely wonky. The menus are SO SLOW to navigate through. Traveling (even on horseback) becomes so tedious and tiresome, which is not the feeling a good open world game's travel would cultivate. Truly, this game would be much better suited to an Uncharted/The Last of Us style that Naughty Dog has mastered, but, unfortunately, Rockstar insists on shoehorning great stories into bland open worlds that do not serve any narrative purpose.

Honestly, the best part of this game may very well be poker. But that is no credit to the game. Who doesn't already enjoy poker? Save yourself $60 and play poker on your phone for free.

If you really want to play a good open world game, try out Horizon Zero Dawn or Breath of the Wild.
And if you want to play a story-driven game that is actually cohesive, with good gameplay, and won't bore you to death, play the Uncharted series or The Last of Us.

I would only recommend buying this game on sale of at least 50% off, otherwise, spend your money elsewhere.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_136?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=136&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The graphics are great and the character animations are wonderful. I could not stand Arthur Morgans voice as it was so stereo typical and ridiculous, almost funny to an extent. The gun play is decent and the constant swapping of weapons on your horse is annoying, but realistic. The worst part of the game is the real life stuff that I don't want to deal with in a video game. You have to feed, bathe, shave, and much more to keep your character in good standing. The biggest argument is that you will rarely have to do it, but that is simply not true and I think fans are just getting so captivated by the game they don't notice it. As someone who did not play the previous game- I definitely noticed. One a good note, the story is good and the characters have unique personalities, making communication enjoyable. I would say the open world is fun to explore, because it can be, but the constant horse riding and following people on a horse makes traveling extremely boring at time. Lat point- why is it when I'm attacked by someone and defend myself, I am now a wanted criminal? that's not how it should work. Overall this is a good game and I would recommend it to someone who has never played the series, but I am not ignorant and I understand it's flaws, which are still not that substantial to stop me from playing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_48?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=48&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They all say basically the same thing and they are all correct. Except for negatives regarding graphics because the graphics are superb. Im not entirely sure how its getting 5 stars ratings and the high praise from the mainstream review outlets. But anyway the controls are highly frustrating especially on the horse. Youre forced to walk (at a slow snails pace walk) in certain areas and then when you are allowed to run you have to hold or continually tap a button which really sucks because you cant enjoy looking around with the camera. Same with the horse. There are a lot of unnecessary button presses and controls to do basic actions. The controls and movements just feel wrong. They are odd and unnatural and do not allow for a smooth control flow as you would expect in a video game. The story I found to be good and it was enough to keep me going for several hours but I struggled so much with the controls that it really made the game not much fun at all. Also there are so many options and icons and things that look like you should be able to do and I just felt lost because the game doesn't give clear instructions on a lot of it. And for some reason they designed the pop up tutorial messages to occur when events or story stuff is happening on the screen. I missed notifications because of this and probable why I felt lost sometimes on what do. And then I would make sure to read a message and completely miss what the characters were saying. very frustrating. I spent so much time trying to tweak the options to get the controls more user friendly and fun but the options available just don't do it. The best control scheme was Standard FPS which helped with sprinting but why am I forced to walk! Id rather have the default as run and then push/hold a button to walk. If this game had the foot and horse controls of a game like Origins or Odyssey or any other modern recent decent game then this would be a near perfect game. The survival elements are pretty good but can be a bit much in some aspects making it more of a forced chore that is not always fun. Overall not really that great a game. Got on Thursday night release (gamestop). Had to install both discs (took a couple of hours) so couldn't play until Friday night after work. Played all weekend and discovered that it kinda sucked. Then sold it that Monday. Paid 60 plus tax sold it for 53. Im ok with a few dollar loss just for trying the game out. My advice if you don't like the game go ahead and sell it before the price starts to drop.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_121?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=121&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This is a shooter for people who don't like shooters, an open world for people who don't like open worlds, and a story for people who don't like stories.
You can't progress in the game unless you kill hoards of bad guys, yet the shooter controls and cumbersome at best.  The delayed response with the controller, the broken cover engine, the animations that you're forced to go through when getting in and out of cover, while being shot at, completely took me out of the game.
The animations you have to sit through while looking through drawers and skinning animals, while they're only a couple of seconds each time, really add up.  When you have a field of 20 bodies and you want to loot, well, better prepare for about 5 minutes of looting animations.
This is not immersive, I do not feel any loyalty to the gang or the main character.  This looks like a movie, and it allows you to hit some buttons at specific times.  You spend 95% of your time riding on the trail to a mission where you talk, follow people slowly, shoot 20 bad guys, then ride to the next mission.
The graphics are great, but the fur and hair looks like garbage.  Maybe it's just my xbox and tv, but when hair mixes with the background graphics, it give a static effect like the old tube tv's.
This is a good game for the casual gamer.  But I've been waiting a long time for this one, and Rockstar delayed the release a couple of times, for what, I don't know.
Trying to draw your weapon works about 25% of the time, and it always seems to default to your pistol.  You can hunt with the bow and arrow, skin an animal, put the pelt and animal on the horse, draw your weapon, and you pistol comes out.  Even though I was just using the bow and arrow.
I have to assume all the great reviews from the game sites were lies, considering none of them were critical of any points in the game.
The release was delayed a couple of times, and we still don't have the multiplayer set up.
The game is a disappointment.  I have supported Rockstar since the first GTA's, this is the worst Rockstar game I've played.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_123?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=123&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Waited 2-3 years for this one. The reviews seemed like a no-brainer - best ranked PS4 game of all time. Number ONE.

I was so disappointed. Heartbroken. EVERYTHING is slow and finicky. Walking around is slow. Picking herbs. The progression. Rising a horse. So many systems are confusing. Bounty system. Saving never works properly. The cores are never explained. How to pay a bounty. How to commit crimes.

This game feels like WORK. Excel would be more exciting. It feels like that being an accountant.

Controls are so illogical. Talk is left trigger, shoot is right trigger. One minuscule mishap, and the whole town is shooting you down, and you end up with $100s in bounty - that's a lot of 50¢ animal pelts.  From now on, every one shoots you on sight, so good luck completing missions to get money.

Every single action has a long press. Why? Fishing has the same button to fish and to put away your gear. Means you always put your gear away when trying to fish.

Everything feels so slow and sluggish. There are so many things to do, but I don't want to do any of them.

Walking around in Rocky terrain is so stressful. The character howls in pain when falling off from a height of a foot or two.

Rising is soooo dull. Fetch this there. Talk to the person at the other end of the map. Fetch this letter at the other end. Catch that guy or another. These look like missions we have done a million times in other games, which is fine, but SO MUCH GALLOPING. Basically out of 60 hours of the game, are we expecting to gallop for 50?

I wouldn't be so mad if the horse wasn't so finicky. Every rock or wrong turn makes the horse collapse, red screen flashing, character ends up on the floor.

Overall, the story and main character is exactly the same as the first one. I cannot tell the difference between the protagonists of the two games. Outlaw with a big heart that redeems himself.

The Abigail missions on the main track are so dumb. Basically women are portrayed as harpies that make men run around to save the day. ""Save my son"" ""buy this ranch for me or I leave you""

This is not a game, it's a cowboy simulator. Drab and boring and finicky like a flight simulator.

This game is overall very good but it has some major flaws that I wished had been mentioned in official reviews:

Pros:

The world is beautiful and detailed.
The world is massive.
It feels alive.
Story is good.

Cons:

The controls are horrible, looting becomes a chore because having to pause for everything while you hold X or O.
Slow and clunky movement, having to walk at a snails place in camp and on missions is frustrating.
In missions the game often feels like it's on rails. It forces you to play how it wants. It's more like watching a slow film.
The bounty/honor system is horrible. Bump into someone, instantly wanted and low honor. Shoot at a shooter? Low honor and bounty for you.
The Sadie character felt like it was added to placate the left. It's forced and takes away from the realism.
Overly complicated health/stamina/deadeye system.
Satchell/Weapons holding is stupid.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_130?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=130&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Ashley","What the H377?","January 30, 2019","Ok so I figured...""hey its a Rockstar game, I love GTA, its been talked about for a long time, they had red dead 1 to fix all the problems and work out all the bugs....It has to be good right?"" Wrong.  I am so disappointed in this game.  I feel like I was tricked and a victim of good marketing.  The only reason Im giving it 2 stars is because its clear they spent a lot of time on the world.  The graphics really arent any better than any other PS4 game out there, the controls are very frustrating and really I could go on and on, its just boring.  I waited until the weekend to buy this game expecting that I would have a hard time putting the controller down. that wasnt the case.

I have had free cheap PS plus games Ive downloaded for free that hooked me more than this game.  I was playing the other night and I literally feel asleep.  Its so bad Im going to be really hesitant to buy the next GTA when it comes out.
 Its like GTA without pretty much everything that made GTA fun. You will literally be riding around on a horse 90% of the time and the game makes it to where you have no choice but to go slow through a bunch a BS dialog. If you read through the reviews even the people that gave it 5 stars still have things to complain about...why are you giving it 5 stars haha? Have you not played any number of other games?  I was expecting it to be ranked up there with...Fallout 4...The Last of Us and so on.  Not even close.

Ive had the game for a total of a week and Im seriously thinking about going to game stop where I bought it and just returning it or something because its that bad and boring.

I was wondering why I didnt see anyone on my friends list ever playing it and now I know why.  Dont fall for the marketing.

I'm not sure what my answer would be, but it isn't a resounding ""yes!"" It's not a bad game by any means and it's not as much of a letdown as SHADOW OF THE TOMB RAIDER, but damn it's a pain to play.
Mostly you spend time riding through mostly empty landscapes and I'm already tired of the painted vistas. I'm extremely tired of being punished for accidentally hitting or bumping the wrong button, going too fast, going too slow, not picking the right arbitrary option, etc.
The controls are terrible and if you accidentally bump into somebody in town, it'll turn into a fight which will stop everything while the law tries to take you in, puts a bounty on your head and you have to flee town. This also happens if you accidentally hit the wrong button and kill someone when you are trying to simply talk to them. Additionally, you have to be facing the exact pixel to interact with things, and will find yourself dead if you ride too fast and hit a rock or a tree or whatever. Sometimes you will get stuck for no reason other than you can't back up while riding any vehicles. So you FINALLY survived that big shootout and got the cart and then run into a fence from which you can't turn around. Get ready to do it over again. And again. And again.
Plus this game forces you to do an absurd number of menial tasks and do them as complicated as possible. Fishing is an unrewarding chore, but it's not as complicated as drinking a freaking cup of coffee. Every time you get on and off your horse you have to reassign your weapons. There's just way too much busywork that makes it draw out the game longer, so that it seems like it's a long game, when it would be really short if you didn't have to jump through hoops just to do simple things. There's not much to do aside from a handful of side quests that are few and far between and the minigames are just ways to pad-out the games some more. You certainly can't make any more than a couple of dollars playing poker, you get nothing by playing dominoes. If you are into super-slow hunting sims, you will enjoy taking an afternoon to find some prey track it, finally kill it, skin it and then either you can eat it which will give you a tiny, temporary bump to your stats, or sell it for a few dollars in a world where guns cost a couple hundred dollars (about 20x more than they would have in real life). Then again, there really isn't much to buy with your money anyway, so you'll end up spending $20 for an engraving on your rifle that you will never be able to see in game anyway, even with a giant UHD TV. I realize there are a lot of stanch defenders and if you can spend an entire day accomplishing almost nothing and enjoy it, more power to you. If you are thinking this is going to be an open world with lots of stuff to do like FALLOUT or ASSASSIN'S CREED, be warned, it's not.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_126?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=126&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The first thing you should know is that game is really slow.  In almost every way.  Getting from one location to another is slow.  Shoot outs are slow.  Every mission takes a really long time.  You have to stop and do maintenance on your equipment and care for your horse.  It is just a slow game with hours of mindless tasks to take care of before you can continue to advance the story.

The combat system is bad as well.  Zoom in for aiming does next to nothing.  You need to continually use dead eye or you miss nearly every shot.  Which takes more time purchasing the supplies to use dead eye.

The largest complaint is story plot.  In the first ten minutes you understand that the protagonist is making poor choices.  You have no option to change this throughout the entire game.  One poor choice leads to another poor choice to another.  You simply follow this list of poor options till the end.  You cannot improve the character's lot in life or future.  I never felt invested in the character because I didn't want to choose any option I was offered during the entire game.  It is like being offered the choice of becoming a thief or becoming a crook.  The illusion of choice that lead to the same result.  Another poorly planned game story with another terrible ending from Rockstar games.

I played it only because the game was free from a PS4 pro purchase and still was not worth the time I spent simply grooming my horse.
Skip this one.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_128?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=128&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Rockstar Knows Its Business.","October 30, 2019","I purchased this game when the Red Dead Redemption II PS4 Pro Bundle was released, on the same day the game itself was released, and not off of Amazon. That being said, I want to give potential customers my honest impressions of Red Dead Redemption II, and I'm focusing entirely on the Single-Player Story/Campaign, as opposed to the Red Dead Online portion of it, because single player is what I experienced, and I won't give feedback on something I don't have an honest impression of. Because that would be, wrong. Wrong in this particular instance would be, more specifically, dishonest. I'll talk about the story and characters first, then move on to the technical aspects of the game, like the controls, graphics, & level of engagement RDR2 delivers, on an interactive level, as opposed to an artistic one.

So, where to begin? Red Dead Redemption 2 is a title whose storyline, characters, themes, and subject matter have made such an indelible and irrevocably profound impression on me, that I could go on for days about it and still wouldn't do the title the justice it deserves.

Rockstar doesn't exactly have a shoddy roster of games to serve as a foundation from which to demonstrate their talents in the field of Game Development and ability to write a good story, with compelling characters. RDR2 features a more serious storyline, with characters that, in my opinion, are not satirical in nature, nor are they laced with any form of innuendos. In case anyone is unaware, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a prequel to the first title, serving to chronicle the events leading up to what transpired in RDR1.

The main cast of characters consist of a gang of outlaws and renegades, led by a charismatic rogue by the name of Dutch Van der Linde. His group of outcasts consists of both men and women, which lends itself well to both creating a compelling and accessible storyline. Dutch has a few subordinates who he relies upon to help him run the gang, among them the main character, Arthur Morgan, whom you play as. Hosea, Micah, and Sadie Adler also play integral roles in the events that unfold.

This isn't a story about people living in some fantasy land where everyone gets what they want and they live happily ever after. It's a very somber, violent, and melancholy, chronicle of a band of outlaws with their backs to the wall. It doesn't glorify the life of a criminal, nor does it encourage, through words or deeds, the perpetration of any such acts.

But it is one heck of a great story. It kept me engaged for its duration, even though I had to sink my teeth into it for a good few hours before the characters and plot had me hooked. The attention to detail with regard to the plotline, as well as the voice acting (which is almost entirely bereft of high-profile celebrities, not that high-profile actors are bad. The lesser-known cast of actors did a fantastic job with their roles, however.) Personally, I was pleased to see that Graham Greene lends his skills to the cast. Dances with Wolves remains my favorite movie of all time, and having the guy who starred as Kicking Bird in the game made me smile. I won't go into detail and lace my personal views into how, and why, the game evoked such emotion in me, suffice it to say that it did, the ending in particular. You can create the best mechanics ever for your game and make everything as responsive and attractive as can be, but when you're playing through a single-player campaign, that's not going to keep the ship afloat if you enjoy an engaging storyline as much as I do. So the story, doesn't disappoint. And the soundtrack is absolutely amazing. It has songs that evoke pure, genuine, emotion, both for what's going on in the game, and, for me, what the game reminds me of in regard to my own life.

The graphics, controls, technical aspects of the aural experience (so, the gunshots, ambient noise, etc.), and accessibility of the overall experience all were things I pretty much fell in love with the first time I booted up RDR2. The game looks amazing, from the character models, the environments, particle effects; you name it, Rockstar paid attention to it. In my opinion, Rockstar set the bar for console game development as far as the single-player experience, with this title. Their other games are very, very well done, but as a general rule, I've noticed the level of quality trending upwards with every title they release. Storyline is a matter of conjecture and personal preference, but graphics and playability, while also somewhat debatable, as one particular aspect of the title, which I will elucidate upon shortly, are a bit more consistent in whether people find them to be to their liking.

As far as the controls go, at least, for me, a good part of the equation is boiled down to a single basic concept: does the character I'm controlling do what I want it to do when I'm holding the remote? And, if so, does it do what I want, reliably? This is a pretty cut-and-dry question, which begs a simple answer. And for this game, the answer is definitely yes.

While the controls of the game are mechanically, exactly to my liking, as well as to my preference, the overall pacing of the game is a bit slow. So, how this relates to the controls boils down to this basic idea: Arthur does what I intend him to do, but it doesn't happen quickly. While the level of precision is, in my opinion, very accurate, it happens at a pace that might be too slow for some players, especially those accustomed to frantic, fast-moving gameplay. But it's a game set in the Wild West, not a modern shooter with automatic weapons and grenade launchers.

I can recall someone leveling a remark at the game which called the action ""slow, and deliberate,"" in a tone which was not intended to be complimentary. While neither the action you control, nor the events you witness, move at a breakneck pace, I tend to enjoy a story that unfolds over a protracted period of time, as well as a method of advancing that story (in this case, the control scheme, and level of input utilized to manipulate said control scheme), that requires me to do a little work to fully maximize! I don't say this to give the impression that I don't respect people's preferences, I guess I'm an excitable man by nature, so that bleeds into my writing as well.

I don't judge people based on how they express opinions, provided those opinions are direct and honest expressions, as opposed to being ulterior or deceptive in nature, or intent.

Overall, I found Red Dead Redemption 2 to be the best game I've ever had the pleasure of playing, on any medium, for any system. I loved everything about it, and while it has a pacing that's definitely not for everyone, it was most assuredly, for me. The story was so well-contrived I'd be hard-pressed to find a movie that evoked as much emotion in me. Hopefully you enjoyed reading this review, and were able to derive a positive from it, because I enjoyed writing about this game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_131?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=131&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The game play just stinks in this game. I litterally can't stay awake long enough to play the game.

The combat is the most boring toned down level of combat I seen ever.

I spent over a hour looking at a horses behind to do a single mission that yielded a measly $60.

Seriously it takes over a hour of nothing but boring horse riding to get anywhere.

You can't shoot someone in the leg and have them limp crawl or even give up they just keep running.

Every kill is just the same old tired roll over in third side scene.

When you shoot someone they just get regenerated later.

If your horse just bumps into a character in the game the whole town will turn out to shoot at you and I post this bounty that is near impossible to pay.

The consequences for doing anything remotely bad are way to severe.

The characters in the game just aren't interesting or memorable at all.

I just found my self struggling to continue to play this game.

And what the heck is up with having to stop and eat, and groom your horse, and maintain weapons... It's such a chore, I think I'd rather clean my toilet or mow the lawn. I don't play video games to do chores maintenance and upkeep: who's terrible idea was that?

It is possible that the game will get better if I stick to it: but for the time being I have lost the will to continue with this bloated monolithic collection of not so fun game play.

For the time being I am personally declaring this game to be a huge dissapointing and am struggling to understand the rave reviews the game is currently getting

I tried to make it fun but it just isn't working for me","2.0 out of 5 stars","",""

It makes you feel like ur advancing in the game. The story is a 9/10 grapics, 10/10. controls are sadly not very good but can be fixed, the combat is a bit boring, takes no skill but its a rockstar game, they are kinda known for that. Play a good 10 hours of this game, if you still dont like it after that then i dont think the western genre is for you. Go play your fortnite becuase i dont think you’ll like anything else like this masterpiece. Now the story is very emotional and you see overtime how the gang or the dutch van der linde gang crumbles over time in a world where the law is taking over. The wild west is waning and the world dont want people like arthur morgan (main character) and the rest of the gang. My tips for trying to like this game is that to play it for 10 hours, remember that no one liked the start. The game gets 100x better after that. fix your controls in the settings. Find other things to do than main quests. The side quests are fun but you dint have to do them. Buy stuff or reward yourself with new weapons and metals and engravings, also buy clothes. try to get attached to the characters early.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_138?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=138&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The game is absolutely gorgeous to look at.  From desert plains to rocky mountains, to dingy swamps, to a New Orleans-like city, the game presents breathtaking vistas and an immersive, real-world feel.  The story sees a gang of outlaws led by Dutch, who continues to promise great things to come.  Arthur Morgan is the main playable character, who begins to slowly grow disillusioned with Dutch's promises and begins to look for his own brand of redemption in the Old West.

I generally like story-driven open world games like this.  Instead of a game it often feels more like an interactive movie.  Though the graphics and size of the game are superior to the original, the first Red Dead Redemption offered a much more intriguing story and more relatable characters.  Also, the control interface was much simpler and more straight forward in the first one.  In RDR2, it takes forever to cycle through your satchel to find what you are looking for.  Other control interface systems are likewise cumbersome.  This is a good game, and if you liked the first Red Dead Redemption you will enjoy it.  Just know that for all the improvements it has over the original, it is just not as fun a game overall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Some scenes are so breathtakingly beautiful - it is exactly how I imagine the U.S. was before all of the industrialization and pollution emerged. I'm still getting used to the controls - there is a LOT going on in the menus but I am here to learn and have fun. This game is a wonderful escape for me; I love getting lost in the characters and story.

Yes Arthur controls a little clunky but not really an issue once you get used to it and i really don't think controls are  any clunkier this time around than the in the first.  Rated 4 stars because there are a few issues that make this game slightly tedious but not all what they seem to be made out to be.  Over all i find this game very enjoyable.  Arthur has to eat, has to help feed his camp with hunting but really hunting is part of the enjoyment.  Maintaining your stats by example stopping to smoke or chew during the fights to regain deadeye can be annoying but truthfully the only really annoying part of this game is the frequent dying and very real possibility of permanent death of your favorite steed.  So i find my self manually saving the game every five minutes to have a  roll back for things like unexpected crimes such as bumping into to someone while riding my horse.  Or horse permanent death. I also can't tell you how many skins i have lost from the back of my horse until i started doing this because when i died any skins i had on my horse previously did not return with the reload.. Death is waiting
 I had no sooner got my favorite horse to a high level of bonding when unexpectedly attacked my horse died and before i could revive him i died as well.  The game autosaves but when it reloads if your horse died for example it stays dead.  So feeling the necessity to manual save so i have a rollback every ten minutes can be tedious.  Death is waiting for you it is planned for you and I seriously doubt you can prevent it.  From accidentally riding your horse off a cliff or being kicked to death after accidentally punching a horse or to that bear waiting around the next bend, bandit traps etc.  So if you don't want to have serious setbacks or lose that favorite horse manual save often.  The scenery options and possibility of this game have 7 out of five stars take your time and enjoy it.  Two other tips i didnt realize at first that if i wanted to steal a horse for example to make money in the beginning i could ride the new horse to the stable and whistle for my main horse to follow.  The next biggest step is stealing wagons to sell to your fence.  Don't bother riding way down south to steal the fancier carriages they are not worth any more money and the chances of getting them to the fence in one piece are very low.  Found the game well worth my money still playing taking my time and enjoying .  Felt it was worth my money..enjoy","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_129?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=129&reviewerType=all_reviews"

R* is truly the master of that domain.  The game also looks fantastic, and you can find yourself just looking at the scenery on occasion.  Unfortunately, some of the negative things Rockstar is known for are prevalent here too - clumsy mechanics, archaic save options, glitches galore, plus occasional ultra rigid mission structure - and all of these are carryovers from all the way back to GTA3 circa 2001 (can’t say they haven’t had enough time to improve and refine).  Worth a buy, but I’m not sure why Rockstar is given a pass on so many things they could have and should have retooled -> keeps it from being a “5 out of 5” game or GOTY candidate in my humble opinion.

Sidebar:  I haven’t dabbled in the online MP, so I really can’t speak to that.  Might be brilliant, but I’ll defer to others there.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_138?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=138&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The game feels like watching a movie: long cut scenes, with endless horse riding and very little action. The main story is very weak and not engaging at all. The need to do boring chores is just killing any desire to play and progress further.

The controls are very complicated and not intuitive to the point that in many cases the wrong controls can cause you to kill NPG or someone and later being hinted by the law enforcement. The whole horse and player inventory is so confusing that one can go to battle without their weapons.

Quests are pointless horse riding and so long that are boring as hell.

- Graphics are absolutely amazing. Some of the best real world environments and lighting to date on a console.

- Controls are deliberately ""mushy"". For instance horse riding controls while awkward actually do feel like riding a real horse. A horse doesn't respond immediately to your commands, and a horse sometimes has a mind of its own. I mean it is not a motorcycle it's a living creature. Single action weapons require cocking.. etc. This is not an issue, this adds to realism. I would say the only real issues this game has as far as controls are concerned are minor annoyances and they in no way get in the way of enjoying the game. These annoyances are: slow walking in the camp, you really can't run in the camp which is a bit annoying, having to hold triangle to loot bodies is a bit annoying. But these things as I said are such minor issues that knocking the rating of the game because of them is nitpicking.

- The world is incredibly detailed and vast. It really does feel like a living breathing world out there. Also it is filled with random encounters and things to do.

- This is more of a wild west simulator than an arcade game. Which I guess is probably the reason why some people dislike it. The developer opted for realism over arcade instant gratification. This game make you work for progression, but none of it is tedious or repetitive. As far as the story is concerned, there is really zero grind required. You don't have to upgrade your camp if you don't want to. But even if you're not trying to upgrade the camp, you make so much money from the main mission that you can just easily upgrade the camp later in the game.

- Voice acting is simply top notch. Every single voice actor is perfectly cast. The main character Arthur Morgan in particular has a convincing performance and a great voice. But so do all the supporting cast.

- I have not finished the story yet. I am about 40 hours in, (60% of the story in). And so far the story has been very good. I've experienced a few high points already that felt really good. Writing is believable and it resembles a high quality film production. I feel quite attached to a few characters already.

- Production value in general is industry leading. From animation, facial expressions, lighting, pacing.. every thing feels high quality. Some of the best I've seen in general.

- Sound track while fitting of the theme Rockstar was going for, feels a bit dry. That's not to say that there aren't some absolutely perfect tracks (D'Angelo's - Unshaken is a particular highlight). The game could have used more scores to highlight the epic nature of the world Rockstar has built. Instead we get a more raw and slow soundtrack that has plenty of quiet periods. This was a deliberate choice by Rockstar, and I can't say it doesn't work. It's just I would like more of a movie theme feel to it than what has been delivered.

Any review which lists this game at less than 4 stars is intellectually dishonest. This game pushes boundaries of what's possible on multiple fronts in terms of entertainment in this medium. It is easily one of the Game of the Year candidates.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_130?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=130&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was bored out of my skull; story isn't engaging; controls are clunky","October 30, 2018","I'm simultaneously glad to see many others having the same opinion of RDR2 as I did, that it's probably the most over hyped game of the past 5-10 years, but disheartened to see 99% of ""critics"" and game/entertainment related web sites gush embarrassingly over it and claim it's a ""Masterpiece"" and ""the best RPG of this generation consoles.""

Fist of all... NO, it's NOT a masterpiece. Not by a long shot. Yes the game is beautifully rendered and realistic but at the same time, it's bleak and barren; yes I suppose there's a lot of quests to do but so far they're VERY repetitive. I've played about 15 hours so far and it took forever to get through the intro and the main tutorials. The story so far is really a snooze fest and I'm having a hard time feeling any bonding with any characters and any drive to continue this story. There are way too many cut scenes and dialogues are way too long and just meaningless fluff.

I agree with many who say the map is just massive... but this is not a good thing like it is in Witcher 3: Wildhunt or God of War or Horizon: Zero Dawn. It literally takes forever to get from one main story interaction to another on your horse. In between is a beautiful landscape but completely void of anything interesting which makes it tedious. Yes there are some side quests to find and places to discover off the main route but from what I've experienced so far a LOT of the map is simply nothing... just pretty landscape.

Yes, I realize I've only played about 15 hours but that's more than enough time for a game to grab my attention, get me interested in the game, the story, the controls and gameplay and start to have emotional investment in it AND especially the characters. RDR2 does none of that and I frankly don't want to wait around to see if that happens.

I've decided there exists a massive disconnect with these so-called ""critics"" and actual, TRUE gamers definition of a ""masterpiece"" gaming experience. For critics it appears... especially with RDR2... all they seem to care about is a beautiful, realistic landscape, anticipation with waiting years for a previously fantastic game to come out with a sequel and more story and cut scenes than actual game play. This is more like an interactive movie, not a game. I've concluded either Rockstar paid off a LOT of reviewers to give RDR2 10/10 ratings or most of them simply aren't true gamers and don't fully understand what most gamers want and respect out of a game and what really constitutes a masterpiece. Sorry but a beautiful landscape that looks absolutely real isn't enough to give a game a great score. Games have been rendered amazingly realistic for years now and it's almost expected. This seems to be the main accolade for most of the reviews I've read online.

You know what an RPG Masterpiece is? God of War. Horizon: Zero Dawn. And what I consider to be the best game ever made: The Witcher 3, Wild Hunt. The Witcher has a massive map and sometimes takes you a while to get from one quest point to another but in between is not only the most realistic landscape you can imagine but stuff to explore and discover at every step of the way, under every rock and behind every bush. Not only that, CD Projekt Red was somehow able to create the most dynamic and LIVE world I've ever seen in a game. Cities are flowing with real side interactions, voices, sounds and animations. I sometimes think the sounds in the game are coming from outside my house. The towns, cities and open space in The Witcher 3 is ALIVE... more alive than any game I've ever played. RDR2 doesn't even come close. Hell, I liked Assassin's Creed: Origins way better than this borefest.

I'm giving this game one star because the review of it here on Amazon should reflect what the game is really like and because it is NOTHING like what so many critics are saying. It's honestly a 6/10 for me.  I doubt I'll even finish it. I'd rather get Assassin's Creed: Odyssey or Spiderman with my limited available gaming time. I'm just glad I didn't get the Special or Ultimate editions.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Three weeks after release and not a single patch to try to fix any of this.  Ridiculous.  Other competing games are released with bugs, but (for one example) AC: Odyssey received multiple patches in the first two weeks fixing various quest bugs.  For Rockstar to just leave their game in this state is ridiculous.  However, I can't bring myself to give just one star because the game is fun and immersive and good... it's just broken.

The game looks terribly blurry/soft focus compared to what I normally get with other PS4 games.

Also speaking as a PC gamer who puts a good chunk of their available gaming time into high performance PC games, I have a really hard time adjusting to the 30fps compared to the locked 60fps I much prefer and am comfortable with on all of my PC games.  The majority of those are played in Native 4k at 60fps.

If the visual quality had been sharper, I could more easily overlook the 30 fps aspects.  But the fact that the game can't maintain a locked 30fps with the Pro, there is really no redeeming qualities left to mention.  I could only tolerate the game up to the second mission, so at I think 2% in, I can't really comment on the actual game play much, except to say that I did see a lot of the control issues others have been focusing on.  I thought it was just me and being somewhat rusty with my DS4 controller and button layout memory.

(I normally use an Xbox One Elite Controller on my PC, so terms like SQUARE, TRIANGLE, CIRCLE, X and which one is R1 vs R2, L1 vs L2.  These are not as ingrained into memory much these days and hard to remember which one is which in the dark while playing the game.  But it appears that a lot of what I was blaming on myself, like the funky weapon wheel issues might be more related to some of these control issues everyone is talking about in their reviews)

I am waiting for the now long over due patch to see if all of these issues are resolved to an acceptable level of improvement.  I have till the 29th to return the PS4 Disc version, and if that patch hasn't arrived by my return deadline, then I am returning my PS4 copy and just waiting for the PC version. I would much prefer seeing the game in True Native 4k (3840x2160) on my Sony 65"" XBR 4k HDR TV rendered by my overclocked 1080ti GPU and 7700k CPU.

I have been waiting for 7 years for this game, and so far I am extremely disappointed.  I wish I could have given this a 5 Star review, which the game may or may not deserve for other reasons besides just the horrible graphics fidelity. But for me personally...  I refuse to play it using a version that reduces the experience to a blurry, eye strain inducing mess!

P.S.  To any BLIND and delusional PS4 Pro fanboys who may take issue with my totally accurate assessment of the current state of the PS4 Pro version of RDR2...  You were obviously born without the ""Attention to Detail"" gene, or simply need glasses.  Either way... You can save your predictable negative commentaries about my frank and honest review of this version for someone who cares.  I will never be coming back on here to read them.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Now, this is a prequel meaning it’s the origin story to the very first RDR that follows John Marston and his epic journey. But let’s start off with gameplay my first  impressions was unsure but over time as the game progressed I actually grew on me it allow me to care even more for my horse and character which is completely different then most games these days to be honest I grew attached to Arthur Morgan making sure his appearance was the appropriate for some certain sceniros if you don’t the other characters around you and will noticed that you haven’t shaved or bathe which it’s extremely immersive even your horse needs to be taken care of and once that happens you’ll bond with that horse and your relationship will grow for an example if your in a gun fight where there’s no where to turn you can whistle and your horse will be there to escort you out super awesome even the hunting is pretty challenging too you can hunt just about anything and there’s territories of legendary animals like a grizzly which you’ll need to be prepare for if you don’t you’ll end up losing trace or eaten haha. When I heard this mechanic was going to be apart of this game I was worried it will get too repetitive and boring but actually I find it fun. Now other than that if you played the first it still has the iconic dead eye which is still epic and addicting but you have to buy things to keep that ability up. Now let’s talk about the icing on the cake the graphics.....Red Redemption is known for its graphics hell the first game still looks super impressive still considering it’s been 10yrs since it’s release. The details are just amazing when your horse moves you can see the back muscles working and can get a feel how powerful this animal is even the people who you encounter feel like actual human beings it’s pretty awesome. So that’s about it for my review I would definitely recommend this game hands down for the 1 star reviews I wouldn’t pay close to attention. I feel like the gaming community these days just want more blowing up, running and cursing than actually enjoy a game that’s telling a rich story and yeah when things spice up then enjoy it.

Definitely not best game ever material. Story is alright, gameplay is alright. It does tend to get boring. The controls also feel pretty clunky. And no its not too realistic or anything you can tell where it fails in realism. Especially when your horse runs straight into a tree or just trips over a rock going head over heels almoat killing you and itself. Never seen a horse due that in real life.

But I honestly felt left down playing it. Maybe there was just too much hype. Don't know.

 Red Dead Redemption 1 was one of the best sandbox games of all time but it wasn't perfect. Mandatory skinning cut scenes, odd fast draw mechanics, random stuff getting in your way while on a mission and some repetitive tasks were annoying but not to a degree that was very bothersome. Well, in making Red Dead Redemption 2, rock star beefed up all those little things you disliked about RDR1 to a game breaking extreme. Apart from a somewhat bland and slow story with mostly unlikable characters, the problems with this game can be summed up in 2 words. Over complicated. For example. When uaing the lever action, you have to press the action button to fire and then again to cycle the action. And if you do any button mashing  (which you won't be avle to avoid as the timing is so fine) then you will automatically fire aa soon as you are done racking the gun. And sometimes you don't need to for some reason and i haven't figured out the ryhm and reason to it. That is one of the most basic examples. For something more normal. When you skin an animal, you have to go to the extra trouble of putting it on the back of your horse just like with criminals in rdr1 (except they made the process a little more complicated) except, some animals you do, some animals you don't and you have to be paying attention to all of this on the fly while dealing with other potential hazards. And even collecting and armung your weapons has now been turned in to a multiple stage process that you are once again forced to make sure you followed all the steps to while getting shot at and/or chased by a grizzly bear. I can literally go on all day about these little stumbling blocks the game has set in front of you to spend all your brain power worrying about. LITERALLY to the point that what SHOULD be the main theme (riding, shooting, exploring etc.) becomes an after thought. And what's worse, a huge portion of these problems are hard wired in to the game and the game mechanics would be thrown way out of whack to fix them. In short, this is an irreparably bad game. One of the few that is so bad that i can honestly say that playing it was a negative experience.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_124?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=124&reviewerType=all_reviews"

10 hours so far.

Single player:
+Storyline mode is really good
+Great graphics
-complicated controls.
I will play the single player mode through to the end for sure.

Online is horrible:
-You are forced to play through two missions at the start to learn the controls...even if you have played multiple  chapters of the single player storyline.
-The multiplayer economy is a hyper inflated grind fest. One 30 minute mission in the game paid me $2...a new low end rifle is $180...so it would take 90 hours of missions just to buy one low end item...uh no thanks.
-There is gold you can trade for game cash...it is earned 5c at a time. Of course it can be bought, so every kid with their parents credit card tied to their PS4/Xbox account can rack up lots of charges for marginal gains in multiplayer.

If you are like me and just want to play online with a friend or two, dont waste your money.

You MUST be a patient gamer and you really need to allow yourself the time for longer play sessions to get the most enjoyment in my opinion. I could write a 3,000 word review on this game, diving into all aspects of the experience. But you have plenty of professional reviews out there to read. My take is simple: if you enjoyed the original Red Dead but found some frustration and fault in the storytelling (akin to most other Rockstar games) then you will enjoy this game much more. I found this to be the most mature and thoughtful storytelling of any Rockstar game to date. By the time the credits roll I would expect you to feel genuine complex emotions about many of these characters. Highly recommended.

My favorite game of all time is Ghost Recon Wildlands.  I can play that game exactly as I choose to - stealthy or full force loud.  I guess I was hoping this would be a game that I could figure a way to play similarly to GRW - set in the beautiful West geography and in an an era which I love.  Instead I find it to be totally ruined by the necessity of extreme, constant continuous character maintenance.

You can't do anything exciting without immediately having to go back to the menus to find what is necessary to repair your character or determine what to do with your loot.  I am spending way more time in the menus than I am in gameplay.  This ruins any feeling of immersion in the game world itself.  Constant crafting, eating, sleeping, bathing, etc is necessary just to survive.  You can't really enjoy the world because you're constantly having to exit it to go to the menus to research what tonic or food you need or clothes you should be wearing.  The health component to the game is overly complicated and figuring out how to keep it tweaked feels more like work than fun. Analyzing which tonic or food works best to develop a certain aspect of your health or stamina is just boring and tedious.  It is way more complicated than it needs to be.  And then you've got to do the same thing with your horse's well-being as well as worrying about keeping all your gang members happy.  This is drudgery that sucks any enjoyment out of the game.  This is really a shame because the scenery in the game is breathtakingly beautiful.  The detail in everything is amazing but I find myself so frustrated most of the time that I can't enjoy it. Any time I find myself in an enjoyable gunfight I know it will be followed by boring time in the menus figuring out how to repair damage done.  I just discovered that there are cheat codes available that might alleviate some of this tediousness, but if you use them - you can't save or even play through the story-line.  Apparently they are only useful in a free roam mode.  If anyone knows a way around this, please share your technique.

As it is, I can't imagine continuing playing this game.  I want to enjoy the game - not read menus, look through inventory, and do research constantly trying to figure out how to maintain and develop my character.  Give us an option to just enjoy the gameplay and environment without spending most of our time just figuring out how to keep our character in surviving shape.  It's just not fun.  I want to stay immersed in the world - not constantly exit to make choices in the menus.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_122?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=122&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I haven’t experienced many games with the level of detail and enjoyable moments that this game provides. This is one of those games that would be the equivalent of an Oscar-winning movie.

Edit: After reading a lot of recent negative reviews, I have to insist that everyone should give the game a chance. I bought the game on release day, and surprisingly never encountered any game breaking bugs or glitches. The story does start off slow, but the story and gameplay really blossoms into something special. It’s so easy to get lost in all the random side missions, mini games, crafting, and hunting. Despite a TON of optional side activities, the game never once felt like a grind or a chore. If you’re able to avoid all the spoilers out there, the ending of the story is so well done and emotion evoking. Not to mention after finishing the game, there is an entire Epilogue that only makes it better and creates a sense of added value. I highly reccomend giving this game a shot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It takes the best portions of previous Rockstar games (which were themselves some of the greatest games of all time) and expands/improves/adds to them. It's the first truly revolutionary game in more than 3 years (the last one was Witcher 3). This game shows what a REAL sequel should look like and puts to shame the glorified expansion packs that companies like EA and Ubisoft market as ""sequels"" every year. Red Dead Online still needs some work, but its still only a beta and the potential is there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After playing for a week, the controls are beyond frustrating.  They are just waaay too complicated, because the game tries to do waaay too much.  Going through the overly complex and convoluted menus has to be the worst part, and you have to struggle with it constantly because the game frequently unequips your weapons loadout, and requires you to perform tons of menial chores and tasks to maintain your health, clothes, weapons, horse, status, etc.

I found the main story somewhat interesting, but it's broken up by boring chores like cooking, shaving, hunting, or you have very long stretches of riding your horse (tapping X button) over this massive map with no real fast travel options when youre outside of your main camp.  Also, I HATE that they force you to walk when youre in your main camp...its sooo slooooow.  They force you to walk in many other places also...there are lots of things make the game painfully slow.  Im interested to get through the story, but it feels like a chore just to play the game.  And there are so many other questionable design choices that will confuse you and frustrate you.

And despite being about a group of bandits, the game punishes you severely for playing as a bad guy.  They put huge bounties on you and generate police if you even bump into someone by accident (I'm not joking here).  Fun should take priority over realism.

As far as graphics, it's very obvious that they use the same engine as GTA5, so the visuals are good, but they are nothing revolutionary.  There are tons of little details that went into creating the game world...it impresses you initially, but then the other frustrating aspects of the game will then spoil that very quickly.

So yah, all stuff you probably heard already, but I want to validate that people's complaints are 100% correct","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_125?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=125&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Smithe","What a letdown","November 3, 2018","This game was a huge letdown. The gameplay is slow, the story is slow, all the mechanics are clunky and tedious. I really dont see how this is supposed to be a good game. Almost every quest is a fetch quest or a escort quest (the two least popular quest types in every RPG). And underlying everything is just this slow tedium for everything. You have to watch a loot animation for every body, watch every skinning (oh and you can only carry a tiny amount of animal parts at a time so hunting is insanely tedious), watch every single drawer and cabinet open when you're looking a house then watch Arthur slowly grab each item individually. It's just painful to play this. I've tried to like it. I've sunk 15 hours into it but it's just so dull that I'm giving up in it.

It might be a good fit for someone who wants a 100% realistic cowboy simulator complete with having to worry about eating properly and bathing while having some of the most abysmal gun play in a current AAA game.

I like that there are consequences for your actions. It's not difficult to stay away from the law; e.g. make sure there are no witnesses when you rob someone, wear your bandana to remain anonymous, move dead bodies off of the road. And when you do make a mistake in town (I accidentally fired my shotgun into the ground) a lawman will run you out of town, but you can return a few minutes later, no big deal.

For those complaining about the lack of cash flow, you'll have to discover a fence who will buy your stolen items. That's how I make a lot of money, but not too much, which is another thing I like about RDR2. So far, I haven't felt too rich like I do in most games. It's made the game feel much more realistic.

Yes, you do have to do some tasks to keep yourself going. However, I enjoy cleaning my guns, brushing my horse, finding a good spot to camp, and cooking up some meat I just hunted. Which brings me to my favorite part of the game: the wildlife. The varied animals and activity is amazing. I recently came across two bucks fighting to the death. I watched through my binoculars as they rammed antlers for a few moments before one buck fell and the other sauntered off victorious (I of course harvested the dead deer for parts and food). There are so many different animals to hunt or take pictures of.

You will be spending a lot of time riding on your horse, but I don't see that as a bad thing! You'll come across so many unique encounters as you ride. Whether it's strangers, enemy camps, KKK meetings, or things much more nefarious, I've enjoyed it all.

All-in-all, RDR2 is one of the best games I've played. It does have some negatives however. It can be a little clunky, talk and aim are on the same trigger, and I had a legendary animal's carcass disappear from my horse. But the positives far outweigh the negatives for me. There have been several moments where I thought, ""Man, I wish I could do this"" and then the game showed me how to do it. Kind of eerie, really.

Definitely pick up this game if you're interested in something you can really dive into that requires mindfulness. This isn't a game where you can turn your brain off and play it. 10/10","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

You can't ""run"" or fast travel anywhere ... your three modes of travel are, ride your horse, walk at an incredibly slow pace, or walk EVEN SLOWER (sneak).  There are way too many options (multiple scroll wheels during battle to make choices) and at least a dozen versions of ""health"" enhancers for 4 different kinds of health you have to micro-manage.  You have to micro manage every aspect of your character, but yet ... you can't do basic things like jump on a rock or run, or lasso a person and get off your horse without setting them free.  The endless cut screens are the WORST.  Typical engagement:  watch 15 minutes of cut-scenes so the game makers can demonstrate just how sweeping and grandiose this game is and then engage in a combat sequence.  Try to save ... oops - manual save is turned off every time you might actually want it (like RIGHT before a battle).  Engage in a battle ... oops, because the controls are the opposite of intuitive, and you have had no opportunity to learn them or practice, you flub the battle and die (or your partner dies), so game over.  Load your last check point.  Re-live the 15 minutes of cut-scenes AGAIN ... rinse and repeat.  Very little fun ... loads of tedium.  This is game is so boring.  I don't want to spend dozens of hours doing electronic versions of chores.  So sad and disappointing.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Yes, the graphics are amazing and best i have ever seen in a game. But the game play is awful, tedious and u will find urself googling countless features of the game that are not explained at all!

This game feels more like a chore then an adventure.

PS: RockStar needs to stick with the GTA series and let this garbage become a distant memory.

1/11/19: This game grows on you. Play it as if its real world and you will not die as much. The side missions are even better then the main missions. Ive played over 30 hrs and am only 25% thru the game. Also learn how to use the Dead Eye feature and it will make game play much smoother.

1/24/19: had to drop the rating again to 3 stars. Im now 50% finished with the game and it has alot more issues then i first thought. I recommend this game but for half off the original price. That should help the frustration level u will encounter.

2/20/19: just finished story mode. Had to bump the rating to 5 stars. Game was incredible. It was a rough start but game gets much better as u continue playing.

I'm not very far into this game and let me tell you... It's a f'ing masterpiece!

Visually, on my PS4 Pro in 4K HDR, this is the most gorgeous game I've ever laid my eyes on! The lighting, contrast, HDR, details, weather...it's a f'ing movie! I find myself all the time literally stopping on my horse to just appreciate the lighting and unprecedented level of detail in the world that Rockstar made!

And the detail! Holy sh*t the detail! It's what we've come to expect from Rockstar... People may complain about slow movements but, EVERYTHING has detail to it! Picking something up, getting on your horse, holstering weapons, getting behind cover, eating, everything was meticulously thought out! That's called TIME PUT IN and it's to be appreciated especially with how some games are launching these days!

Story wise, so far, it keeps you engaged... Riding with people to a destination. Hiccups along the way bullt in to the story for action. The stories are good and seem to be building up as you progress and unlock more along the way. Very cool how they've tied everything in! Love it!

The most tedious thing is traveling but, IT'S THE WILD WEST! Horse and carriage! What do you expect?! It took DAYS to travel back then! Having to ride a horse for 10-20 minutes honestly gives you a realistic sense of travel and there are things along the way to keep you busy that pop up at random.

Gun fights are awesome! The animations are so cool it's like playing a movie! Combat isn't bad either as the character seems to be environmentally aware. I don't see how smashing someone's head into a bar or wall is boring?! It's how things happened back then! People weren't trained, they just scraped!

Also, weapons and weapon customization are badass! A bunch you can do! Also customize your horse, wardrobe and others things. There's a bunch to do in this game!

I'm probably not even 10% into the game and it just gets better as I progress! It's obvious Rockstar put YEARS into this game and I seriously have to pry the controller out of my hands most times to stop playing and actually be productive lmao...

F'ing masterpiece!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_128?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=128&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Only reason i’m giving 2 stars is because of the graphics, they’re amazing. I regret paying for the $80 version because it doesn’t feel like i’ve gotten anything different from that of that $60 version.

Out of the 40-50 hours i’ve been playing, i feel like 45 of those hours have been spent riding a damn horse. it’s exhausting having to see Arthur ride a horse all the time for long periods of time. The horses aren’t fast and they fatigue so yea you aren’t really getting anywhere quickly.

The story seems to drag on and gets boring too. Sometimes the missions make you do small, stupid things like build a fence or something.

I’ve loved every ROCKSTAR game, i just don’t feel the same about this one.

I found the immersion incredible and after a while, I realized that playing the game was more about being in the environment than just executing the next goal; the environment was so rich, I often found myself avoiding the next main story objective, wanting instead to explore and enjoy the little things.

I think this is one of the reasons I find RDR2 so good. After about 10 hours in, that feeling came back – I just wanted to be in the environment. The missions are fun, and the story is the best story I’ve found in a game, and so, consequently, I’m not in a rush to see it finish; it’s like when you realize you’re watching a really fantastic movie, and you don’t want it to end. A game offers the opportunity to immerse yourself in an environment more fully than a movie, and a correctly constructed open-world game allows you to do it at a leisurely pace rather than race from task to task, and still enjoy the time as it passes. If not, why bother making it open world? The world itself has to be the star of the show, as much as the missions, story, or anything else.

I’ve played most open world games. Character movement is better in other franchises. Gunplay is better elsewhere, inventory management has better implementation examples in any number of other titles. However, as much as I love the other open worlds out there, none is quite as impressive to me as RDR2. The thought put into it is evident. The scale of the accomplishment is impressive. Dialogue between characters is exceptional, and when I compare it to many recent titles it makes them look lazy and amateur. Though it has bugs, I’ve encountered very few, which is a nice, refreshing change compared to the normal bug set I usually get from Bethesda or Ubisoft. This game not only feels polished, it contains all kinds of extra things that have exceeded my expectations in delightful ways. I’m not yet finished with the main story, though I feel like I’m close to the end – and I’m ready to give it the award for best story in a video game. The writing is superb.

I acknowledge that some of this has to do with a fondness and sentimentality for RDR. To their credit, Rockstar seamlessly knitted RDR2’s prequel story into the beginning of RDR, and they knew exactly how to hit all the right emotional buttons for anyone who loved the 2010 title.

There are always negative reviews of things. Some of the negative reviews I’ve read are, of course, not at all my experience. I’m 50+ hours into RDR2 and I’ve loved every minute of it; I don’t want it to end. A lot of it comes down to personal preference. In the seven years between RDR and RDR2 I played a lot of other open world games, and I realized very quickly into RDR2 that the pace of those games was not what the environment of West Elizabeth was all about. I remembered thinking to myself halfway through the game that someone who wasn’t patient was probably going to hate RDR2. Patience has its rewards, and sure enough, it made for an extremely rich, emotional experience story-wise, something I rarely – if ever – get from the other titles I’ve played. There’s plenty of action in this game if you want to engage action, but there’s also the slow pleasure of a casual poker game or a horse ride just to see the sights (as opposed to a ride to get to the start of a mission). Since I find the environment so enjoyable, the game works for me whereas it might not for someone who just wants to execute the main story as quickly as possible.

I’m not unfamiliar with that desire; there are some games where I just want to get to the end because the world isn’t rich enough to hold my attention. With RDR2, as much as I want to complete the full story, I never want it to end…probably because it’ll be another seven years for a sequel.

It’ll be worth waiting for if it’s this well made and executed. Hat’s off, Rockstar. You’re like the Kubrick of video gaming. Not a lot of output, but when you do…wow. Thanks for the good work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_135?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=135&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Hsiao","Lots of Options In The Game","November 5, 2018","I preordered this game from my local store and was really excited Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2) finally got released. The delays that pushed the release dates are well worth the wait. My preorder came with the war horse which you could finally use after you start chapter 2.

Let's start with the graphics:
Amazing. Absolutely Stunning. The details put into it is why I love this game. I have a regular Playstation 4 and the game runs just fine. Theres no visible lag or graphic issues. The fan may run a little loud because of the graphic intensity but not a big problem. This game puts in details in every aspect - horses, trees, wild animals. You name it and it'll be okay.

Control:
I see a lot of people complaining about the controls. I personally wasn't too bothered by it. The game teaches you what to do and you'll eventually get used to it. I didn't like the controls at first but then it grew on me. You can also customize the controls if needed. The challenge when learning controls, I would say is that the popup is pretty quick and usually when you do a mission. Hard to focus on both things on the screen.

Gameplay:
The beginning of the game may seem kind of slow because of all the horseback riding and talking but be patient and then you'll finally be able to explore. I like how a lot of things matter in this game. From the clothes you wear, your hygiene, beard, the amount you sleep, etc. What really made me love this game are customizations. I can customize anything from my outfit, horse, beard. The things you can think of, you can probably do in the game. With that said, I recommend trying to do the missions more to unlock things such as guns and horses. If you just free roam, you'll have a lot of fun but not everything will be unlocked. There's lots of challenges in this game, from hunting animals for food and collection to planning a heist without being discovered. Rockstar makes it as realistic as possible. Overall, I really enjoy this game and can see myself playing this game for months.

My advice would be, be patient, the story and game gets better. There's a lot of horseback riding, but later on you can unlock things such as stagecoach rides or train rides. Overall, an excellent game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_127?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=127&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The hype wagons have been circling for sometime now and man have they paid off. Rockstar has smashed the record for opening sales, but does this equate to the best game ever made? If you are one of the very few (and smart) who didn't pre-order this game, this is for you.

2. The controls are so poorly implemented and immersion breaking. This is my biggest gripe. You feel this from the second you pick up the remote. Its like playing a character with two left hands and two left feet (it literally feels like Assassin's Creed 1 - you heard me). Truly how they managed to mess this up in 2018 is somewhat of a mystery to me. Auto aiming was a big mistake, but absolutely AND obviously necessary due to this failed system. It's anything but smooth. There are so many ways to do things and you have to remember them all. As a cherry on top, there are invisible walls everywhere to break the illusion that you can go anywhere you want.

2. The first thing you will hear about this game is how good the graphics are. Sorry, but the graphics are sub-par. Having just come from Odyssey, it's truly jarring what a blurry mess this game is by today's standards. The level of detail gets a solid YES, but actual graphics, no way. The character models, especially the faces, are the worst offenders here. Clearly the detail level in the world forced corners to be cut elsewhere. At times it feels like 720p on my PS4 Pro/4k TV.

3. SLOOOOOOW and boring. The story is just so slow paced. I can't emphasize this enough. There just nothing that really draws you in. This is further exasperated by how large the world is, yet how little there is to do on the way. At first you marvel at the beauty and level of detail... Which gets very old very quickly when you realize there's nothing to do. It just becomes a chore - You are working and not getting paid.

4. Lastly, the game just isn't that fun. I can't say it any plainer than that. I've played games with all the aforementioned problems and yet they still managed to be fun. This one just isn't.

Overall, I bought into the hype and regret it now. In 2018 it's just not acceptable for a AAA studio to produce sub-par game design like this. The fact that they will make hundreds of millions from all the pre-orders is a slap in gamers' faces. This is the first game I've pre-ordered since the Diablo 3 debacle and once again have been reminded why never to do that. Shame on me.

Rockstar had a lot riding on this one (especially with all the bad publicity from 100 hour work weeks) and I've never been more suspicious of a AAA studio paying for fake reviews. The best way I can describe this game - its like watching a slow-paced blurry movie that allows you to push buttons sometimes. Could've been so much more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_123?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=123&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you're looking for an open world game filled with non-stop fluid action this game may not be for you.

-Story.
This game is a prequel to the original Red Dead Redemption, but is a self contained story. There are some references for those who played the previous game, but not required to play to get immersed into the story.

Plot: The world is no longer a lawless land. You and your outlaw community is on the run from the government and try to survive day-to-day life while in-fighting with a rival outlaw community.

Game is a very slow burn. In fact the first few hours is basically a walking simulator (if you keep auto aim on by default). For those who just want to run-and-gun and watch consistent over-the-top action cinematic, you will be disappointed. There's a lot of in-game dialogue between characters flushing out the world and relationships between them, so a lot of causal banters between action sequences. There could be large stretch of traversal land and fetch quests before a large shoot out action sequence occurs.

Gameplay.
Can be played in first or third person. The latter is preferred as the game is optimized for it (random frame rate dips in first person)

You have to keep track of stamina and health of yourself and your horse. But it's very passive and won't we using up resources constantly. You also have to keep your weapons maintained and cleaned for optimal performance/accuracy during shoot outs.

Game also has an RPG element; as upgrades are based on how much you use of an ability, weapon or stat. There are also in-game purchasable upgrades

Aiming and shooting is similar to other Rockstar games like GTA series, Red Dead Redemption, and LA Niore where there's a small dot  reticle you have to aim through.

Guns/shooting has a nice weighted re-coil to them making it feel realistic every time you take a shot. Running/walking animations are a bit stiff, but you get accustomed to it overtime

Melee combat is bad and result in blocking and punching at opportune times based on enemies' televised attacks

There's an eagle eye special that's on a cool down. When used, you go into slow motion and can aim at multiple enemies by moving the cursor over them before shooting them all at once.

Game is very mission based. Most especially in the beginning fells like fetch quests given by your outlaw community members who do recon missions, but need muscle or a gunslinger to finish the job.

There's a moral system where majority of the choices results in to kill or spare a rival outlaw member or a witness to the crime you committed. This at times the choices are difficult as you know from the outset that you're part of an outlaw community hated by the government. There is pay off though as if you choose to kill they'll be less random enemy encounters, conversely if you spare the right people prices of items may cost less or you may get more side missions with rewards. Depending on your morality level at the end of the game, you will get different endings

You also have to upgrade your camp for weapon/resource upgrades and fast travel.

The amount you can carry is limited, so some inventory is equipped on your horse. So when going on missions or hunting you have to swap/manage the character's inventory and the horses'

Clothing you wear, if you plan to shave impact the world in terms of climate (how fast stamina drains in cold weather for example) and wanted level of how you look like when you're first caught doing the bad deed. For the latter, if you change clothes or shave/grow out beard some people may not recognize you from the wanted posters.

The game is very massive with a 2 disc set on PS4 (most of it probably from numerous in-game dialogue/cut scene). The map will slowly open up as complete more missions from your camp are completed. Main campaign can take upwards to 50 hours to complete especially if you explore and do side activities.

-Graphics
Very good. Love the draw distance, weather, and light/shadow effects. At times the graphics can be a mixed bag, but overall very good for a large open world game. Very nice attention to detail from the tracks left in the snow/mud, to your horse randomly taking a#2 as you're walking around talking to NPCs

Overall, very good game for those who are into old Westerns with character relationships/banters, and don't mind the slow pace. Very enjoyable game if you put in the time investment","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_135?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=135&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Unanimously applauded as one of the best games of all time, RDR2 has gone on to be rated 10/10 by most of the mainstream gaming publications. I had to purchase a copy and try this game on day of release. Apparently this was going to change gaming forever?!

After 20+ hours of gaming. I can confirm to you, that RDR 2 is not going to change gaming forever. It is nothing more, nothing less, a Rockstar game. And it plays like it has always played. Any other claim is rubbish and I am suspicious of the legitimacy of many gaming publications that declared this game to be much more.

RDR 2 will go down in history as having one of the most underwhelming introductions of all time. At least the first few hours, your excitement deflates while you painstakingly run though the tutorial. Its slow, sluggish, tedious.

And although RDR 2 gets better, its still slow, sluggish and tedious to some extent at all times. And thats what hurts this game the most. Want to play poker... its slow, sluggish and tedious. Want to raid a room, its slow, sluggish and tedious. Want to fish, you guessed it, slow, sluggish and tedious. It zaps the fun out of the whole experience.

The controls in this game never feel right. At times having to tap tap tap to get your character to face the right direction to LOOT. Constantly mashing 'X' to get him to run faster. Its frustrating. The swapping of weapons, scrolling through items, the interface is never quite seamless and mostly still cumbersome after so many hours.

In true Rockstar fashion the game never really gains any traction with the story, most of the dialogue is laborious. You meet characters and you share a few words. Rinse repeat. Your actions never truly effect your world, except for Rockstars ""Wanted"" system. Which nowadays, basically means, if you run too hot, the law will kill or arrest you and you lose a few bucks and then everything goes back to normal.

The skins you are rewarded in this game for hunting perfect pelts is incredibly annoying. Specially when for most of us, thats a big part of the gaming experience. What do I get for this?.. silly items like a rams head on my tent post, or an upgraded rug next to my camp. A visual upgrade at best, but what the heck do I care for it.

The game needed to explore way more RPG elements. By end of Chapter 2, I was pretty much finished with upgrading my character and his skills. Thats insane.

I have complained for a while now. Rockstar has an incredible production department. The graphics and scope of the environment is beautiful. But the innards of the game, the RPG element, the story, the ideas and the interaction is letting it down in 2018. Playing mini games like dominos and poker is not a fulfilling endeavour. Its not good enough anymore. That is so 2008. And, holding R2 to chop some wood...bah... its just a monkeys game.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_123?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=123&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The gameplay, the story--I have played through the game more times than I can count and each time is just as enjoyable as before. I waited eight years for another game, and, at first glance, Rockstar provided a prequel that was worth the wait, though still cannot touch the charm of its predecessor. However, after hours of gameplay, I find myself struggling to finish the game.

The controls are basically the same, though more complicated. RDR2 focuses more on realism, immersing you into the world. Dead eye mostly works the same, though it does not recharge as it did before, which makes it worthless half the time unless you are constantly using tonics to recharge it. Keeping them on hand isn't the issue, but the hassle of going into your inventory in the middle of a fight multiple times is just tedious and not worth it. Still, gun fights are about the same as they were in RDR1, so you can get by without dead eye most of the time, it just makes it less fun.

The new horse system is one thing that has greatly improved since RDR1. I loved my horse in RDR1 and would get upset if anything happened to him. Shoot my horse? I'm going to be more pissed then ever. RDR2 improves on your relationship with your horse. You bond with it, which opens up more options for you, such as telling your horse to follow or stay, and increases your horse's stamina and health. Your horse will trust you more the stronger your bond. Personally, I prefer to catch horses in the wild over buying them--it feels more like it's MY horse that way since I'm the only person he/she has ever known. Aside from a few special ones, wild horses do not have the speed of the most expensive ones in the stable, but speed doesn't matter that much in the game. I feel that breaking in a wild horse is much more satisfying than simply purchasing one in a stable. But the horses seem much slower in RDR2 and you are constantly hitting X to keep at a good speed.

Your horse's saddle is where your gun inventory is stored. It takes time to remember to grab your guns off the horse before walking away. This sometimes becomes a pain, especially when the game randomly replaces the gun you want to use with another one and your horse is no where around. I had an incident during a story mission where my bolt action rifle was suddenly replaced by my Lancaster repeater. It wasn't the end of the world, but disappointing since I love my bolt action rifle. The inventory system makes the game more realistic, however it is still a video game, so it is a system I could have done without. That said, it is sort of satisfying to watch Arthur swap out guns on the saddle for some reason.

The wanted system in the game is one thing that needs improving. Just defending yourself from robbery can get you a bounty for murder. Riding too fast through town can get you wanted, especially when a person changes directions and you collide with them. I had a guy on horseback run into me one my horse, which made my horse tumble, landing on top of me, and I was wanted for unarmed assault due to this collision, forcing me to flee the area and return later. I don't know if Rockstar intended it that way or if it will be patched later on, but it makes being around people and in towns more of a hassle than anything.

The story is a long one that starts off slow so you can get used to the controls. Arthur is a very likeable character. He's no John Marston, but he has his own charming personality that you grow to love within a few hours. Anyone who played RDR1 could probably guess going into this game that things are going to go bad, and they do. Without giving away any spoilers, you start off right after the Blackwater job where John was shot (mentioned in RDR1) and things get worse from there. In chapter five the story starts to become extremely depressing, and only gets worse in chapter six, so much so that I am struggling to finish it. This is my main gripe with the game. I knew going into the game that people would die, I just did not expect some of the events that make the story so depressing that you wonder if you even want to finish it. Rather than have it quick and done, it is drawn out over HOURS of game play. Some of the story feels repetitive, too, and is reminiscent of GTA V. You continue the story hoping that something will get better, except it keeps getting worse. Rockstar does everything to immerse you into the world and then reaches into your chest, pulls out your heart, and stomps on it.

The game is definitely an impressive one. Years of perfecting it show and everyone who worked on the game should be proud of what they created (and I certainly sympathize with the ridiculous hours they worked to finish it). Nature feels alive and is a joy to watch. I once even saw a fox chasing a rabbit, accidentally killed the fox with my horse, then skinned it while the rabbit ran off. I saw a grizzly bear fending off a pack of wolves--that one I avoided and continued on my way. I've seen a hawk dive down and fly away with a rattlesnake in his talons. If it were not for the depressing story and broken wanted system, I wouldn't even hesitate to give the game a perfect review. Every game is going to have minor flaws--nothing can be perfect, but RDR2 comes close. If you didn't like RDR1, you're not going to like this one. It isn't a fast-paced GTA with horses: it's a lengthy western with depth and many, many side activities. Hunting alone can entertain a person for hours. It will never take the place of RDR1, but I don't think anything will ever compare. As it's own game, it is enjoyable...up until the story puts you in tears for days.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_131?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=131&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Through chapter 1 & 2 you will learn all the mechanics and everything from fishing to poker will be opened up to you. Game feels slow and can drag sometimes with long horse rides, but that makes the game feel big. Sometimes I didn't enjoy it (riding) and others I did, leading my horse on a high mountain trail and seeing some of the nooks and crannies was nice. Speaking of nooks and crannies there are a lot. Hunting legendary animals and taking on bounties to treasure maps and a serial killer to track down to name a few of the better ones. Others like finding all 10 dinosaur bones sites might not appeal to everyone. One thing I like is if you commit crimes and it can be tied to you, the bounty will stay on you until you pay it off. Bounty hunters will keep tracking you down if you linger in one place too long. Voice acting is good and story works well also. Arthur can grow his beard, hair, get dirty or keep himself clean cut, all up to you.  On top of that don't forget to refill your health and stamina by eating or sleeping. He can also be an honorable man or a rotten one. One the best games of the year for me. Go find those banjo playing freeks (hills have eyes) and couples that lure you into their home to rob you. Hope you somehow come out on top or you'll be gator meat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Word of warning, again, to those that expect a first person shooter, quick in and out experience. This is not that game. This game is meant for you to get lost in and explore for hours, and I mean hours.

I want to be transported to an amazing world and experience a wonderful story. There is none of that in Red Dead Redemption 2!
I get that people enjoy the reality that is now achievable in modern gaming systems, but not at the cost of fun. I had no fun playing this game because you don't play it, you just take care of the main character. It's like a more advanced (and less fun) Tamagotchi. You have to feed, bathe, dress appropriately, and maintain a sleep cycle for the main character. Same goes for your horse. Almost all of which in real time.
Speaking of real time, your travel is also in real time, *although I didn't play long enough to find any sort of fast travel. You end up spending an hour riding to a single mission (not too fast or your horse dies and is gone forever) where you beat some guy up to collect $10 and then spend another hour riding back to camp to spend that $10 on food for you and your horse. I'll admit that the graphics are amazing, so that 2 hour long ride is beautiful, but that is the only thing this game has going for it, in my opinion.
I had read similar reviews complaining about the daily maintenance of the character/horses, but I decided to give the game a shot because of the hype. Complete waste of money. I tried powering through until the story got better, but I honestly despised every single character, hated the terrible controls that change at random with no warning, and loathed having to make sure I wiped the main characters a$$ just right so they wouldn't chafe and lose stamina more rapidly.
Long story short, if you enjoy the open world of The Witcher or Horizon Zero Dawn, RDR2 is nothing like those games. Save your time, money, and frustrations with this game and just buy a Tamagotchi instead. You'll thank me in the end.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Seriously, the travel scenes are way too long.  And everything just seems like mashing a lot of buttons instead of grab and go.  I don't know... there are a lot of RDR fans here who are happy right now. I am a first timer of this game.  I've been playing for 2 hours waiting for something good to start.  Now I just think I will go to bed.

I make an exception for RDR2 because I've seen more than a couple of these professional reviews complaining about various aspects of the game - and as someone who has played through 80% of the story after about 70 hours I can tell you that all the criticism is ridiculous; this is the finest game produced for any platform to date.

Have you ever read a book, or watched a movie that made you feel something other than entertained?  Genuine emotions of excitement, humor, joy, or sadness?  This is where RDR2 shines - it fully immerses you in the world and its characters with never before seen realism, graphics and acting.  This is the book that you start reading again as soon as you finish the last page- the movie you stay seated for in the theater to watch multiple times.

Rockstar has created a masterpiece.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've beaten it and have little to no interest in 100 percent completion, as you know is usually a big downside to games with a reward given upon a super lengthy completion. As my general game experience is naturally changed with the storyline, I have restarted my game from the beginning. It would have been useful to be aware that in chapter 5 you must manually save your game if you want to just have fun and explore the game with the same original setup. The german character at the camp is a big failure to me because he is cold-hearted and nazi-like and generally a horrible person everyone wants to be rid of which is somewhat disturbing, but not really. I am not displeased with the writing and storyline but rather amazingly pleased with the storyline of GTA V in comparison. I don't think cinemas should be the focal point of game design, but they are great for people who some reason want to have a game/film combination. Technical problems are few, which are the camera having Depth Of Field Effects, an option that you can turn off in GTA V and now is permanently stuck to on. Also any weapons you have in your loadout go from your loadout at random times to out of your loadout and stored on your horse which flees hastily from you when enemies attack. Like when you set up camp, you have 2 large weapons in your inventory and you get up and continue playing, unaware your weapons are now stored back on your horse until you are in combat. These problems are widely known and talked about so I assume they will be patched. Plus, the game is too amazingly well done to look at these as major problems. The same goes for the Motion Blur which is not able to turn off, there is a problem not only on my regular HD TV, which seems to be this model of tv's weak point, but also hardcore gamers with their Playstation 4 new version and 4K tvs, which I assume will be patched in an update as well at some point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_131?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=131&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'll never buy another one of their games. I put about 100 hours into this game and it's the same crappy experience as GTA, where no matter what you innovate or accomplish, the script dominates everything. I worked very hard to save up $8000, including finding several of the hidden treasures, but then by following the story missions, I ended up shipwrecked in Cuba and lost everything. Now I'm back where I started, no money, no horse, none of my purchased weapons. Starting all over from scratch. I'm royally pissed. This game is huge waste of time. You can do exactly what the script says. Not more, not less. Do anything at all innovative or independent, and it will be taken from you. If you take the machine gun nest at Hanging Dog Ranch (with considerable difficulty), guess what your reward is? Yep. It disappears forever and you never get to use it again. Even in the simplest things, like if the mission says you have to get to Shady Bell from Van Horn, and you are smart and think to take the train... Nope. A big middle finger from Rockstar. You can't take the train. Why? Because they say so. I hate this game. They corner you into being a sad little button pushing drone, doing exactly what you're told, walking as fast as they say you can, to stand exactly where they say to stand, etc. It's all kinds of fancy in appearance, but it isn't fun. I have more autonomy and interesting options for a dynamic experience when I'm wiping my hairy a*. Graphics don't make up for a terrible player experience. One more customer lost forever. I watched these ratings during the release. A huge number of 5 star ratings were posted in mere hours. My guess is employees and stock holders driving sales. If it's a shallow review, take that into consideration. The detailed experience is miserable scripted monotony.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_122?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=122&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's not that it's difficult, but a lot of the game is needlessly complex, like gun maintenance, perfect hide collecting (required for progress) and horse cleaning - if you only have an hour or two a night to play, you're gonna forget it and be lost.

The cover in combat was particularly frustrating, deaths sometimes feel unfair.

I was very suprised at how unenjoyable an experince it has been. It has a lot of problems. The biggest is just being flat out boring. I've played 5 hours and there has been nothing to hook me in. Just boring, slow, emptiness. Now I thought that Octopath Traveler had a boring story (which it does) but there are other redemptive parts of that game like the combat. The gun play here is trash. Considering uncharted is 3rd person coverbased they should have just copied that and saved on the 100hr work weeks. This is being hailed as the next step forward. With that in mind I have to compare it to a game that was the next step forward The Witcher 3. Within 5 hours of starting The Witcher I was having a blast from the combat to a compelling story and world. Red Dead 2 has none of this and while there are many technically inferior games they have some redemptive quality. Red Dead has no redemption. I feel jipped by not only Rockstar but also by all the mainstream reviewers who have done nothing but heap praise on this heap of boring hyperbole.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I never get downloads unless it was a game from the last decade. I always buy disks to reduce the number of bugs. Which by the way comes with two CD's for the download. This is a huge map and in this game one racks up a large body count. So looting bodies takes awhile, the historical aspect and reality of the game catch you off guard. For example after ambushing a camp the police will come to investigate and unless you are in the middle of nowhere yes if you create havoc especially in town the sheriff will be after you.

The game could of taken more time to explain how to play but I suppose that will come with more time on the platform. Bear attacks actually scared the hell out of me. I have seen legit bear attacks and I was not having that. Again it's a game that took a long time to develop but frankly its such a huge map, and I 'm growing up so video games dont really appeal to me as much.

Negative reviews are completely unwarranted (todays gaming youth rant)","January 19, 2019","First and foremost WOW, just wow. Rockstar has gone above and beyond with this one. This game is an absolute masterpiece, from gameplay to visuals and the music. I haven't been this engulfed/consumed by a game in a very long time and man does it feel good. I haven't woke up wanting to play a game in ages. I was honestly starting to lose hope. I read through a lot of the reviews and was questioning buying this game. That is until I dug a little deeper. With so many negative reviews about I had to understand why. The truth of it is, today's gaming youth has no clue how to appreciate the mind-blowing experience this game delivers. They are stuck on instant gratification, receiving everything for nothing, pleading for all the glory within a 20 min window of gameplay IE Fortnite. No depth, no meaning, no adventure, I've never seen a more lifeless game in my 30 years of gaming. I played 2 matches and never touched it again because there was nothing there, ok so I beat out 99 players and win, and for what..... Absolutely nothing. Nothing of any meaning anyway. Red Dead (if you are not apart of the group above) Grabs you right from the start. It's above and beyond the game that I expected and I still have so much more to do. Had to write this review because I see far too many kids writing reviews without a shred of intellect and they are just plain wrong, not a matter of opinion here I am stating facts. This game may not be for everyone, that is understandable. However, if you could think on your own like most of us adults do, you would know such a thing before buying it and not waste your money while leaving a crap review in the process. I do not buy games that do not interest me, say dragon ball z not that they are bad games, I just know what I am into and that is not it. That's what I feel like is happening here, kids ""I love fortnite, whats read dead, oh this game sucks"" they just have no clue how to appreciate something so intellectually above them, So for all those that get butthurt by this stick to your sweet skins and zero depth games, while I sit back, immerse myself in an unforgettable story, with memorable characters, stunning dialog, on point music and experience all the glory that is RDR2.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I didn't think I could like anyone better than John Marston and I actually did not like Arthur Morgan in the beginning. However, his sense of humor quickly appealed and his character arc was one that, even if you knew how it was going to end when you began playing the game, you hated to see unfold. Arthur has easily, for me, taken over John's spot (John in his younger - more immature - days was still very likeable...but an idiotic douche at times ha ha).

The gameplay is amazing and even when you're just running around the countryside very entertaining. Sooooooo many side missions and stuff to do aside from the main storyline, fantastic! Tons of animals to study and hunt, I loved that there were so many. There are some annoyances, mostly revolving around transportation abilities, but then I just tell myself I get to spend extra time with my horse and who knows what I might run into along the way. However, I still wish there were better ways to travel to anywhere when you're not at camp rather than the ""cinematic button.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I need money to buy new equipment. I need to go hunt. You could spend many hours playing this game strictly as a hunter. Maybe you want to hint people? Bounties are posted in towns and provide decent income. Maybe now you’ll do a few story missions. Maybe you want to hunt for treasure? Maybe you want to take down legendary animals to craft rare gear? Maybe you want to hunt for bandit camps so you can rid the world of their filth? Maybe next you want to donate money to your camp fund for upgrades to the camp, which in turn will benefit you? So much to do in this open world. At one point, I found a severed torso hung up under a bridge with a cryptic message written next to it... looks like a murder mystery.

The first two or three hours of the game are designed as a tutorial/establishment of story and characters. Judging from some of these reviews, there is a generation of people that can’t remember a time when it was okay to slowly build up a story, and not immediately throw explosions and action in your face. I guess the battle royale games have created a faced paced, almost crack head like need for instant action. I read one review where they were complaining about having to ride horses a lot. It’s a cowboy/outlaw Wild West game... what did you expect? That’s like complaining that there is too much driving in GTA. Bottom line, this is a great game. The attention to detail is second to none. When you shoot your guns, they will eventually get dirty, requiring a cleaning. When you are walking up or down a steep hill, small rocks and pebbles start to roll down the hill behind you. The animal A.I. Feels very authentic. Hunting is fun and immersive. Random encounters are well thought out and numerous. Upgrading guns is interesting and fun. The way people interact with each other and your character is realistic. You ever walk around in real life bumping into people... they are gonna get pissed. They get pissed in this game. Be careful not to stand in front of someone and stare at them, they will get mad.

To sum it all up. I can understand someone not enjoying a game, and giving it less than 5 stars, or whatever. But to give this game a 1/5 is just completely wrong and lacking reason. I am having a blast with this game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's hard to appreciate the deliberate pace coming from God of War, Spider-Man and Assassin's Creed. In fact, by the end of Chapter 1 and the beginning of Chapter 2 I came very close to returning the game altogether. I came within minutes of dozing off, controller in hand.

HOWEVER, I am SO glad I stuck with it. When the world became overwhelming I did a bit of research (Google lol) and got through soem not well-explained aspects of the game, but the main and side quests are exciting, suspenseful and so diverse. I never felt like it was too repetitive.

I also found myself enjoying doing things outside of the main missions like riding around on my trusty steed, hunting, robbing random folks sitting next to campfires, throwing people off carriages and holding trains hostage. The world is your oyster here!

Moral of the story? Throw your morals out the window :) Have some fun, don't get too overwhelmed, don't be afraid to explore and break some in-game ""rules"" and see what's waiting for you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_125?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=125&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Wish","Positive Reviews are Bought and Paid For","June 21, 2019","Anyone who says ""Rockstar did it right"" is crazy.  Rockstar has been using the same clumsy game mechanics (movement, shooting, fighting, etc) since the early GTA games, and nothing has changed.  Now instead of a silly satirical games like GTA, they tried to get all serious and authentic, without making their game mechanics serious or authentic.  This game is infuriatingly mismanaged.  Movement is slow and clunky, shooting is clumsy, and EVERYTHING is tedious and achingly slow.  And don't bother spending time to upgrade and bond with your horse because the game will just kill it and waste all of your time and money.  Total disappointment.  Note to Rockstar...play a good game like God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, or Last of Us.  Once you know how it's done, THEN you can try to make a ""serious"" game.  Until then, stick to dumb mayhem games like GTA.  And that's the most frustrating thing about this game actually.  The main character is an outlaw, but if you do anything even remotely criminal, every player in the game tries to kill you.  No exxageration--I rode past some and kicked them, and all of a sudden every policeman in the city was shooting at me.  Good job Rockstar...SUPER realistic.

Yes, it does get better. Chapter 4 is when the game finally flips the switch and really kicks the missions into a higher gear. There's enough action happening in the missions now that it balances the slower parts out better and kept me more engaged through to the end. The initial ending, without spoiling it, was not really a surprise unlike RDR1 where the ending really catches you off guard completely and didn't quite see coming a mile off like this game does. The epilogue portion was nice though (again, I'm not going to spoil any of it). But now that I've finished the game I will say my feelings on it haven't changed much. The story did get better as it went on but many of my criticisms I go into detail below still remain the same so to put it simply, I'm not going to change a word of this review. However, I think I will bump up my rating to a 7.5/10 having now completed it (potentially an 8/10 once I do a lot of the extra content this game offers). That may seem low but that's my honest opinion. I'd round the star rating up to 4/5 stars but I'm not giving Rockstar the benefit of the doubt on this one. They dropped the ball on some crucial components (controls mostly) and sacrificed its fun factor for realism and attention to detail to the point where it became too much. Both of these things I noticed within the first couple of hours of playing and it never changed now 40+ hours in and after having completed it. That's that.***

I'll preface by saying I'm only 10 hours in and none of these early reviews are much further either so I don't feel so bad for posting impressions of a game I haven't finished yet since nobody else has yet either.

Similar to most, I was very much anticipating this game the moment it was announced they were working on it years ago. I enjoyed the first one enough to know I'll be getting the sequel no matter what so I didn't watch any trailers for it, didn't look at any news or screenshots of the game beforehand, didn't watch any gameplay videos... I went in with a clean slate and open-mind.

So after I waited about an hour and half for this beast to finally finish installing, I could finally sit down and play RDR2. And not long after I finished the first mission did most of my initial excitement leave completely as the game immediately establishes it's going to move at an extremely slow pace as you go from Point A to Point B performing menial tasks as you sit through cutscene after cutscene with nothing much happening gameplay-wise. The entire first chapter is a 3 hour long tutorial level, a refresher course of many of the same mechanics and controls as the previous Red Dead. There's a couple of shootouts in there but for the most part you'll be spending the majority of your first 3 hours in this game watching cutscenes, listening to dialogue and traveling around a pretty much empty snow-blanketed map. Fun, right? Not really... I just about fell asleep during this time.

In this time, you'll also quickly realize Rockstar still has not updated their god-awful controls and mechanics. Your character still feels as stiff as a rock, every action you do feels like a chore to do because you're fighting these archaic controls. Time to stop being so stubborn Rockstar and start taking some notes from other developers who have really tight controls and mechanics. The way games should play, not this nonsense. No input you put in feels fluid, everything feels clunky and unnatural. In fact, it still feels like you're playing those old PS2 era GTA's since Rockstar really hasn't updated their mechanics or controls much since. Unforgivable especially coming off playing games with really good controls like Horizon Zero Dawn and Spider-Man. Hell, even AC: Odyssey has better and more fluid controls than this mess.

Then, once you get to Chapter 2 the game really starts. You now have free reign of the entire map so alright, now it's going to start getting good, right? WRONG. I started Chapter 2 by jumping right into some missions. One of the missions is essentially a tour through the first town in the game, Valentine. You somehow get into a scuffle with some dudes so you knock them out and the missions over. So alright, not very exciting still, but whatever. So I start doing some other missions. You've got your typical bounty missions (go here, usually someplace really far away and will take you forever to get to, and kill some guy, come back and rinse and repeat), debt collecting missions (same as bounty missions except you don't have to kill them, you just rob them, rinse and repeat). As you're riding through the landscape doing these menial, boring tasks, you get to observe the world. Which, much like the previous Red Dead, is really quite empty and there's nothing much going on especially when you're in between towns. It's a whole lotta trees, animals, mountains and rivers and nothing much else. Every now and then you'll get that random event like in all Rockstar games. One I ran into in the middle of the nowhere, some NPC was stuck on the side of the path with his horse who was agitated for some reason. So, the NPC is trying to calm the thing down and the horse ends up kicking him in the face and knocking him out as he ragdolls down a hill. Pretty funny. Rockstar still has a great feel for randomness, but for the most part, their worlds are pretty stagnant and dead and RDR2 is no exception.

Now, the good. Graphics are beautiful, story seems like it's ramping up to something good even though it's moving too slowly. The script is great, the voice acting is phenomenal, great attention to detail almost to a fault. All these things are exceptionally good as is expected from Rockstar. BUT, the downside is it seems they focused so much on script and the story and getting the graphics to look really good that they treated the gameplay as an afterthought and it suffers greatly. They just expect you to be totally engaged in all these dialogue sequences and cutscenes that you're to forget that you're not really doing much of anything gameplay-wise. You're just going from Point A to Point B, repeating many of the same kind of missions and tasks you've already done in the previous one. And with the controls and mechanics being so poor, it takes you away even further from the experience this game wants to give. It wants to be that big, epic game but it just drawls on and takes your attention span for granted.

I'm assuming it ramps up as you go along, but the stiff character and stiff controls is a real game breaker for me. They should have refined this 10 years ago with GTA IV. That was great opportunity to upgrade it being a new system at the time (PS3) but yet they were like nope, it's totally fine even though many other developers were really starting to make really fluid controls mechanics. And here we are, PS4 era and Rockstar Games are still making games with PS2 era controls and mechanics. I forgave it 10 years ago, I can't forgive it any longer. They need to do something with the clunky controls, it hampers the experience immensely of all their games.

In conclusion, I'm going to keep on chugging along with this game in hope it gets better as it goes along. I'll update this review if anything changes my mind but 10 hours in and it's not looking too good for this supposed GOTY that many people keep claiming it is. Not when it was released in the same year as a game like God Of War. A game with actual good controls and extremely varied and addictive gameplay, not to mention a great story and graphics to boot. Sorry Rockstar fans, but RDR never stood a chance.

UPDATE: Well, I've made it to Chapter 3 somehow and still nothing has happened in this game that changes any of my above views. Still an extremely slow drag. There's one mission near the end of Chapter 2 that really proves how bad the controls are. It's the mission where you're under attack in Valentine and there's a portion where you have to use a stage coach as cover... as it's moving... as about a dozen guys are shooting at you from all angles. The controls are just infuriatingly bad here. You have to walk (key word there is 'walk', you can't run), stay in cover and shoot in all directions... at the same time. You're literally in a scramble on the controller in this part and it highlights everything wrong with the controls. By some luck, you'll spray enough bullets everywhere to kill enough guys to get through it. It was obviously intended to be a difficult part but the difficulty mostly stems from you fighting with the controls, not from just a difficulty spike in a mission. I've died only 3-4 times so far and the one I will take responsibility for because I was being stupid and trying to run and gun early in the game (you gotta at least try it in the beginning and see if you can get away with it, every game is different) and I failed miserably. The other 3 or so happened directly in effect of the bad controls. I died only once at the aforementioned stage coach mission and my 2nd run felt like pure luck. There was nothing real satisfactory about beating it either. I quite literally just stumbled through it. After you get through that stage coach part, you have to book it on your horse as you're still getting shot at and because the horse handles however it wants when it's near other objects, it's so unpredictable (ie. say there's a decent size rock in the road; sometimes your horse will just side step it and keep going, sometimes he'll hit it and you'll fly off and you're horse dies, and sometimes he'll get stuck on it). Well, I got stuck on a rock right when I needed to book it and I just barely got away within one hit of death. Pure stroke of luck I got through that whole mission. This game is not a test of any skill, it's a test of patience and fighting with controls that decide to work against you at every opportunity.

I've failed a couple missions just based on pure randomness happening but that's consistent with all Rockstar Games. There's one mission where you have to rob a stage coach with money in it. It has a bunch of enemies surrounding it, so you're chasing the stage coach, picking off these guys one by one and I got it down to just the driver of the stage coach left. Right when I'm about to take the final kill shot, the dude just drives the thing off a cliff for no reason, destroying the stage coach and making me fail the mission. What is that all about? Stuff like that just happens in this game and you never know when the game is going to decide when to screw you over. It just happens and most cases at the worst times. Probably will be more updates as I continue through this game. But yeah, long story short, nothing has changed so far and I'm well into Chapter 3 now.","3.0 out of 5 stars","",""

The original Red dead redemption is the only game I ever got 100% completion on, in fact I did it several times or more, this prequel will likely be the same, but there are some tasks that could have been reasons why you play, instead they become in-spite ofs.
Some reviewers has accused this game of being boring. It is slow, but that is intentional, it’s a game designed to be emersive, on that fact is where the flaws start. Instead of going at your own pace and completing missions you want, when you want, it feels like the game pushes and rushes you to get to the next mission. Only to slow the pace back down during the mission. It becomes a hurry up and wait situation. I accidentally started two missions in chapter three alone back to back while trying to do other things.
I was a real life bounty hunter for twenty years and have many times been accused of being born 100 years to late, so I was so looking forward to this and even the new tasks. Lets take a look.
Bonding with your horse. Absolutely loved the idea, but then realized you can’t get the horse you want until the game is almost over.
Eating. Could have been an immersive experience, but you can only eat at camp every two days. Unless you just rest and eat you get underwiegit. I ate after and sometimes during each mission, i always kept supplies stocked and handy, yet I remain underweight the whole time.
Customizing and maintaining weapons again loved the idea, was disappointed by execution. I earned the nickname the Wolf as a bounty hunter, so before I even bought the game had it planned out, cattleman revolver with wolf carved in handle. Get the game and nope there is only like seven animals you can put on the grip the wolf is not one of them. To me this just seems rushed or lazy, why not at least have the legendary animals be part of customization?
Bathing. Again could have been immersive, but you can’t bathe in camp. The time period this takes place even makeshift showers were available in camps like this.
The camp could have been a major hub, come back to, eat, bath, tend to horse, sleep, fast travel, etc. but when you come back several times and can’t eat or bathe, it gets to the point where you say why am I coming here, theres no point.
Here is what it seems the people at Rockstar were discussing.
1. Lets make this realistic by having them bond with their horse, yea, but lets make it unrealistic by saying certain breeds don’t exist until later and force people to bond with horses they don’t want.
2. Lets make it realistic by having them to bathe to stay clean, but lets make it unrealistic and They just can’t figure out how to have basic necessities at camp, so force them to go to town to bathe.
3. Lets make it realistic and have players maintain and customize weapons, but lets not let them have the weapons they want and lets not put very many customize options in, just enough to let them know how great this could have been.
4. Hey lets allow players to fast travel from a map at Aurthors tent, but lets pretend he can’t pull out a map when he camps.
This is a game that could have been almost perfect and so much fun, but because of a lack of thought or rushing it becomes a game you trudge through tedious tasks because you know you’ll get to do something cool later. That’s the most irritating thing, these task could have been purposeful, meaningful and even had more impact at certain points in the game, but because Rockstar decided to have an open world that wasn’t quite oen until later or because of no follow through they become tedious. None of these tasks had to be tedious, everyone of them could have added to the quality and the immersive play of this game. They lost out on some of the game of the year awards, I think for these exact reasons. Even some of these could have been corrected, you want me to play through the first time with limited resources fine, give us a game+ mode that lets us play through the next sessions starting with our own load out.  It would increase replay value. Is that to much for players to ask for, for a game that broke sales records. Without the players, you would not have broke those records. Throw us a bone and lets us play these tasks like they could have been unbogged down by meaningless make them mean something.
Thank you Rockstar for giving me. Western when very few will, a game I’ Play for months and even years, but shame on you for dropping the ball and making things that could have been awesome feel tedious.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

G.","Read This Before You Buy!","January 13, 2019","Update Jan 17 to 1 Star: I'm selling this game immediately on eBay. The controls are infuriatingly horrible. I tried a few hours of mundane things like tracking & hunting and control/movement is even worse than combat. First-person POV is if you are 2' tall. Can't see squat unless on horse and horse scares every animal from 100' into running away. The most beautiful and absolutely pathetic motion design of an overhyped NEW game I've had the misfortune of wasting my money on. Don't waste yours!

From a life long fps gamer who 95% completed the first RDR. Playing sequel on a 60"" 4G concave tv w/ headphones. I'll keep it short as I can w/ no spoilers:
PROS:
- The visual details of this game are without equal for the PS4 platform. Absolutely stunning. Perfect detail, ranging from pond scum floating on marsh water to a horse taking a steamy dump. I've sent hours on horseback just logging birds and found it actually relaxing.

- Area of play/map is very big/diverse. It's hard to put in perspective b/c you can't traverse in a straight line due to topography. From the highest elevation/furthest area North, heavily clothed, freezing and in deep snow to the Tropical South, with mosquitos, gators and stripped down to essentials. I love that.

- The story line is a good one. Better than the first game, in my opinion. A few totally hilarious adventures and encounters. Challenges and collectibles are vast and HARD. I am sort of glad for that (see Cons).

**My 2 star review is for these CONS:
- The character controls (Oh Rockstar...smdh), yet again, are abysmally bad for all the hard work that went into this game. In my opinion, it's as bad as the first version. Maybe it's my ignorance about coding & processing but with TWO discs worth of data, I'd think they could've done so much better. Moving Arthur around is like being an 80yr old, 9 month pregnant, mentally limited, couch potato. Can't run, climb, jump, fight or shoot to save his life 75% of the time. Literally. You'll see, it's pathetic. He even plays cards slow!

- Combat. The almost too realistic mechanics is a big negative for this. It's just unecessarily complicated and not fun until you're hours/days into game to better equip and even after wasting ALL your time, it sucks. Big problem: you're character reacts to being shot at by NPCs. They ALL shoot at you. ALL the time. They ALWAYS know where you are. Meaning, every-single-time a NPC shoots at you, your character moves, making your reticle (when you can find it) move around. Also, I've adjusted controls, video and my TV 5 dif times and can still barely see the aiming reticle. One thing that paticularly annoyed me about this, when firing a repeater rifle, one has to pull the trigger to fire AND TO LOAD THE NEXT BULLET!! Half the time I press R2, it's to load another friggin bullet! Sucks when you have a headshot needed to gold medal a challenge and pull trigger - only to load a round... C'mon! *Remember how poorly the character moves - on top of all this....

- Very limited fast travel. Not kidding, they didn't address this, again. Have to go to a terminal, in a town, and pay for either train or stagecoach and only with limited destinations. Again. Travel is SOOO SLOW and you do that more than anything else in this game.

- **This alone almost made me return the game** DO NOT BUY A, NOR PAY TO UPGRADE, A HORSE! I bought, fully upgraded and completely bonded with a horse that cost me ~$800 of the very first monies I made. It took hours to do so. Hours. I go on a mission to interview a gunslinger, have to chase him on top of a train and when the mission completes, I go to jump back on my horse and it's the $8 horse I started the game with....WTF. Looked everywhere (including stable I purchased from and that gave me ""papers"" for horse) and the upgraded horse was erased from time & space. Poof. I could've punched a kitten.

The graphics are unbelievable,
giving the game tremendous atmosphere and the feeling of truly being there. I also loved the various
characters in the game (my favorite being gorgeous tomboy bounty hunter Sadie Adler), and how there is
a mix of the old (John Marston from RDR1) and the new (charismatic protagonist Arthur Morgan). However,
what I found lacking in the game was the freshness that we've seen in Rockstar's previous outings,
namely Red Dead Redemption 1 and Grand Theft Auto Five. Those two games presented us with things
 we had never seen before. Here, while the set pieces are fun, they were very similar to what we've seen
in previous Rockstar games. Its almost as if the company has at last exhausted all its ideas.

True, it might be a bit of the same old same old, but holy smokes what a beautiful package. Play the game
just to marvel at the beauty of this fully realized Old West world, if nothing else.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_136?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=136&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I decided to give Red Dead Redemption 2 a try though and am enjoying it quite a bit. I think a newer player who enjoys westerns will get more out of this game, but it is a great looking and great playing game for veterans to get something out of as well.
It's not without flaws and minor things to gripe about though. Still feel like I am in tutorial mode even after the second train heist using the oil wagon, but it appears to be that deep and big of a game. I think players of the previous games will find some of this annoying, but I forgot a lot of RDR gameplay mechanics so it is good to get some refreshers. I didn't understand why it doesn't explain the dead eye mechanics very well from the start since it's such a big part of RDR gameplay, or I missed it somewhere (hold L3 and R3 down). Felt like knowing it early on would help with the wolves and checking off some accomplishments without replaying missions. Mission briefings beforehand explaining objectives like time requirements would be nice, but would spoil things too I suppose. Looks like you can go back and replay some things but it is sketchy because you don't want to mess up a save file. The save system seems a little complex as well because with autosave on you always get those ""are you sure you want to save over such and such save file?"" messages. Probably best to switch to manual save only, but early on you don't want to risk redoing the long intro as the recent South Park joked about. I'd say the first chunk of the game is a little too punishing with how much you have to ride around before fast travel becomes available. The improved graphics help, but I'm already growing weary of the environment and travel and can't wait for fast travel to become available. Also, early on before you make any money the game isn't as fun because you have to be really careful not to cross anybody or do the wrong thing because getting a bounty removed is expensive and can all but lock off areas you can go safely. Also found that early on non-mission stuff is kind of boring and more of the same kind of thing you get in GTA or the old RDR games like going to the theaters and whatnot. Went into Lemoyne early on and found it dull without a mission available. I think the game will open up quite a bit once I do some serious hunting and finally get in on some big heists and poker games. Like I said, not much money early on with camp upgrades and not having funds to enter big poker games yet.
But there are some surprises depending on how you play the game, for instance someone I helped once put an item on his tab for me after a second encounter that I quickly upgraded and got a trophy on right away and there is something cool about the small skirmishes and random encounters you can get involved in and the different moral consequences both you and your character experience.
That said, looking forward to pressing on because no matter how it goes from here it is certainly an improved RDR game and I'm not looking forward to too many games other than Death Stranding at this point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_134?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=134&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Have not felt bored for even a second.","November 26, 2018","I had to chime in based on all of these reviews I am seeing that call this game ""boring"", ""ZZZ-fest"", ""snore"", etc.

I couldn't disagree more. Now...if you are looking for a high octane, intense, fast-paced, banger of a game..I could see how this may not be for you. So if that is the case, don't buy it.

The crowning achievement of this game is its ability to immerse you. More than any other I have ever played, I get absolutely lost in the world of RDR2. It is a slower paced game but that is what I love about it. It's slow, but never boring.

Those complaining about the lack of fast traveling- once you hit chapter 2, paying for a train ticket shouldn't be an issue and that's easy enough of a way to get around quickly. However, so much of the fun in this game is riding from point A to point B and taking part in the experiences that unfold. Running into some rando with a snake bite or a guy whose arm is hanging off and needs a ride to the doctor...or spotting that perfect whitetail deer and veering off to chase it for the pelt you've been dreaming of. These are things you would miss if you fast traveled all over the place and you'd be losing out on such a huge part of the game.

Sure, the controls take some getting used to. Nothing pisses me off more than pulling a gun on a dude when I meant to just greet him. Also, the bounty system is frustrating. But these are all things you grow accustomed to with practice  and become much easier to avoid as the game progresses.

The graphics are incredible. The characters grasp you. The voice-acting...just OMG. The missions and side quests and hunting and fishing and  weapons and loot and extras are all SO GOOD.

So, ask yourself this- are you willing to sacrifice hard, fast, intense game play for something slower, smarter, and more immersive? Then buy this game. If not, stick with the new Black Ops.  I'll be over here in my buckskin chaps fishing for a legendary bass with my friend Lenny.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_128?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=128&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Online, the camping system is bad, very different from story.

The posse system only means you now have gangs of people griefing you rather than just one person.
I had 3 people go way out of their way to kill me while I was hunting, then go off and kill other people.  You can kind of watch this all play out on the map...  and since they can't rob the people they are killing there really is no reason to do it except to ruin your time.

Shot in the back 5 times on the way to a quest...  very sad.

Updated JUN 19'

Camping still horrible, but they have essentially fixed the griefer problems.  Very Nice.  I can log in and play the game.
There is still PLENTY of pvp opportunity, but if I just want to hunt or fish I can do that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_132?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=132&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Truly a masterpiece! Rockstar you nailed it!","November 20, 2018","This game is a masterpiece. Rockstar did not disappoint! I haven't felt this respected by a developer since The Witcher 3. This is how developers should treat their fans. Rockstar delivered greater than I expected! In a world with most AAA developers seemingly alienating their fanbases ie. Bethesda, Bungie, EA. Disney in the movie scene. Take a moment to appreciate that Rockstar got it right. Enough flowers. Now to the game. The attention to detail is painstaking. The visuals are hands down the best I've ever seen. The story is compelling and the characters are relatable. The AI for NPCs is great not real but best I've seen. The guns/weapons and combat are a challenge to master. The whole game is bass ackwards when compared to the status quo. This game is not a race to the finish line! This game begs you to get lost in it's systems. Kick off your shoes and stay a while. Every single time I log on I learn something new! Exploration is king. In a world that feels alive! So many sandboxes reach for but cannot attain the level of immersion this game offers. The works that has gone into this game is literally bonkers. I'm not doing cons. They're neglible and I can totally forgive them.

Listen don't play this like a challenge to be conquered. Play this like you're stepping into a Masterpiece. Breathe it in and appreciate the time you use. I'm at 45% completion in the storyline. I'm in no rush to finish. Thanks Rockstar and associated, truly appreciate the game. Thanks for reading guys! I would recommend you buy.

I will update it once I finish the game. But a few things are Killing Me so far!!

* Is Arthur made of lead? He walks so slow! Like the Witcher trying to carry 600 lbs.
* Arthur’s voice. I may be in the minority, but his voice doesn’t match his looks. If I had to draw a guy to match this voice, he would be a fat, chain smoking inmate with a bad accent. It’s like he’s straining trying to make his voice sound raspy and southern. It doesn’t feel authentic.
* Hope you like traveling A LOT via horseback.
* I don’t like holding down buttons for extended periods of time every time I want to pick something up, search someone, walk at a faster pace, etc. Why can’t I just push is once and be done? Taking time to loot anything is insufferable.

However
* The graphics are stellar. The scenery is amazing.
* Most of the voice acting is very good. Although Sadi Adler, and Author are over the top. Give Ruby from “Cold Mountain” a hoarse voice and you’ve got Sadi Adler. This is what happens when city clickers to to talk southern.
* This game is sure to keep you busy if you can get into it.

Update:
I finally completed they game. I changed it from a 3 star to a 5 star because the game deserves it. When I first started the game, I though it may not be for me even though I am a diverse gamer. There isn’t a specific genre I like the most and I learned to like, even love, games I never thought I would. This game is no exception. I’m not really into the western thing, but I’m glad I stuck it out with this game because by chapter 3 I found myself not wanting to quite playing. There is so much to love about this game. The story is very good. It gets better the more you play. You care about the main characters. It matters how you develop your characters. The graphics are beautiful. Some of the stuff I said in my earlier review still hold true.
1. Arthur in normal walking mode is intolerable.
2. I loved Sadie. She is a great character, but her voice tries to hard to be redneck.
3. Having to walk at a snails pace through camp is also intolerable.

But....

Authors voice finally grew on me. It took awhile though.

I have played so many PS4 games over the years. This one is going in my top 10 for sure.  The Witcher 3 still remains my #1.

Be good to your horse. Morals matter. Fast travel via map, stage coach, or train.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_129?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=129&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The attention to detail and in-game conversations are phenomenal. Rockstar really has done an amazing job this building on previous successes. They just keep getting better. The Saint Denis stuff in Ch 4 is particularly impressive. You can definitely play as a bad guy, but it's harder to do so. While I no longer feel the bounty system ruins the game, it is still a pain, many hours in.

I could have quit the game after a few hours but didn't. I really did not like it at all in the beginning. But then I started to figure things out. The long horse rides don't bother me as much. The bounty system is still a pain but there's ways to work around it. The easiest is to empty your wallet by donating to the camp and turning yourself in. I'm into chapter 3 right now and am enjoying the experience more. Arthur is warming up to me and there are a ton of interesting interactions in this crazy world. Adding 2 stars. If you are like me and hated this game just a few hours in, I recommend you stick it out and keep playing. It does get better!

**Original 1 star review**
""Play how you want"" they said. ""Be a good guy or a bad guy"" they said. Uh huh, until you slightly bump someone on foot or while on horse resulting in an assault charge followed by a bounty that does not expire forcing you to pay it. Shoot back? Watch it double, then triple. Run? Go for it, then you will have bounty hunters waiting for you after every mission you do anywhere in the map, in addition to losing access to the town where the charge is.

I absolutely LOVED the first Red Dead so this is a massive disappointment and makes the game zero fun to play. Yes the visuals are great, especially on 4K, yes the dialog can be interesting, no, Arthur Morgan is not John Marston, not even close. There are a ton of other problems around movement, long travel and general mechanics but the punishing bounty system ruins the game. I suggest you wait for a patch before buying, assuming they ever actually fix this. There is no difficulty or game play level adjustment so you are stuck with Rockstar's default ""real world"" level. The good old days of GTA-esque do-whatever-you-want are over...","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

From the story line, dialogue, graphics and game play it will take you on a journey of at least 60 hours of gamer heaven. Now, just to get this out of the way I am not a fan of GTA. They have made RDR2 controls better and more realistic in this game. Anyways, for some reason it feels better to be an outlaw killing people rather than some gang banger. Weird morals, right? For all those who don't like the controls you can manually adjust them to feel more like a regular FPS shooter. I have done this and the controls feel even more smoother.

As for travel time... Rockstar has painstakingly taken the time to make this incredible game. It is realistic not to dash around everywhere ESPECIALLY IN THE WILD WEST. Holy people come on are you serious? If you feel so inclined not to ride your horse around you have other options. Later in the story you have the option to purchase fast travel from the camp. If not you can purchase a train or coach ticket and you will ""dash"" to any town you want. If you take the train you can stay on it and rob it like a Bad..... If you want. Not only is it more realistic but I also believe Rockstar wants you to appreciate the detail and scenery they've put into the game while traveling.

If you're a fan of side missions. There is plenty to be had. Bounties, helping random strangers, meeting people... Also with this you can choose to help them or kill them. Helping them gives you good reputation and killing them... Well... Contrary to belief it will give you bad reputation which will determine how people treat you. One cool trick is if you greet random strangers you will get good reputation. Some of the other activities you can accomplish in the game are camping, crafting your own supplies, hunting, fishing, search for treasure maps and sell all your stolen goods to your local Fence. Oh, did I tell you that you can make off with someone's else's coach and sell it? Yes you can!!!

Do I dare say it? Yes, I will. This game is better than God of War. GoW lacks depth, the gameplay is slow and boring. If I hear him say BOY one more time.... RDR2 makes for a game with fantastic depth and playability. You have so many options in this open world. Get it. You won't regret it!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_130?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=130&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The controls are inexcusably clunky. There's a constant, nagging tedium present managing their ""core system"". Infinite enemies are a poor substitute for actual difficulty. Most things are unlocked too late in the story for anyone to actually have fun with them. The game pretends to give you same agency, but all your decisions just lead to the same place anyway. The story, overall, is just so-so. The world is beautiful, but the game itself has a million ugly little things about it.
Rockstar should leave the faux western simulator nonsense for Oregon Trail.

This game is worth 20, maybe 30 dollars. Don't buy it for a cent more.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

First off, i give the game 4.5 solid stars. The amount of detail rockstar put into this game is mind blowing. You'll never run out of new things to see and do. The scenery is absolutly breath taking and one thing i dont hear a lot of people reviewing this game talk about is the music. It just perfectly sets the mood for whereever you go and what your doing. The graphics are very very very good, although I do feel they were a bit over exaggerated  compared to what we seen in previews and trailors before the game came out. There are the standard goofy bugs and glitches that rockstar is known for so do not be surprised if you run into some issues here and there. The story keeps the player engaged and interested. But does have some slow spots inbetween. This is a very story driven game so you have to keep in mind this is game where you have to just slow down, enjoy your surroundings, and take everything in a little at a time. I feel like soo many games are just pumped out quickly, beaten quickly, then companies just force DLC down your throat. This isnt that game. SLOW DOWN AND ENJOY IT!!! My major critique and flaw with this game is hands down the controls and combat. I loved the first RDR but i absolutely hated the combat and aiming and this game hardly improved on that at all. Im finally getting used to the controls as far as switching weapons and eating rations to regain health, stamina, and dead eye, but the combat system is just feels soooo outdated and clunky and honestly is just not fun, especially in 3rd person. In 1st person i feel like the combat is more controllable, but a far strech from even being good. Im a huge fan of first person shooters, because the combat, aiming, switching weapons is smooth and fluid. Im also a huge fan of rpg's in the 3rd person because of the amount of extra detail you get in your surrounds. If they polished these issues, which i have high hopes they will/can rdr2 has potential to be a near perfect game, but will never be completely perfect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_125?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=125&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'll give it that the graphics are okay and I see what they're attempting with the horse maintenance, getting cold in the rain, and all the other little things they want you to have to take care of in order for it to feel real and immersive but let me get to some action already.

I hate that when you walk through town if you brush up against someone it can turn into you getting killed. I shot a guy in a saloon on accident and was promptly killed myself because the controls are soooo screwy.  I hate that I have to clean my horse every time I get off it. I hate that I have to clean my guns all the time. I hate that you can't pick up a hooker. I hate that spending 30 minutes at a poker table yields a whopping $10. I hate that it takes forever to get from place to place. I hate that your horse gets tired unless you're walking all the time. I hate that....I think you get it....I loved Red Dead 1 but #2 is #2...","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_130?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=130&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The story is good, and the story threads are all throughout the game. Voice overs are great! And the game is filled with plenty of activities. If only they had stopped there...

Want to know why the main storyline takes 50-60 hours, two words: TIME SINK

There are WAY too many time sinks in this game. I really don't want to do horse maintenance, by brushing its coat or feeding it carrots. In GTA, I didn't have to stop at the gas station or have the oil changed. R* stop with the Nintendogs crap!

Bathing by itself wouldn't be that bad, but we have to push a button and watch an animation for EVERY LIMB - head, left arm, right arm, left leg, left arm. And having someone come in to wash you is just as tedious.

Not once have I purchased a game specifically for it's personal hygiene mechanics, and there is a reason. It's even less fun to do these things in the virtual world than the real one.

More time sinks. Can't run in the camp and the NPCs are spaced far apart.

Biggest time sink of all. Damn SLOW as molasses horses! You'll be staring at the butt of that horse 90% of your gameplay. A saving grace here is the cinematic auto-ride feature which will automatically follow the path you've specified, but wait. You can't walk away, because you still have to hold down the 'x' button. I'm going to get a chip clip and have it hold down the 'x' button.

Pick-up or interact with an item control sucks. You have to hold down the button for 1.5 seconds to interact with the object. How about this R*, just have us press the button and not hold it! It's actually worse than that, because sometimes they mix it up by having you just press and not hold the button. Come on sub-systems guys, get on the same UI controls playbook.

Gun play controls are rubbish. They are OK at a distance, but have something like a dog or wolf on you with melee and the controls are wonky to say the least.

Oh wait, was that an item with which to interact? Who the hell knows because the interact menu selection doesn't always show up when you get near the item. OK, so now we do a little dance that I like to call, the ""item detection sidestep"". Grab your joystick whirl a round, now up and down, and up and down, and step to the left, step to the right, and there she is! Now press the button, hold it down. dose-e-doe...

Fishing! Sounds great. But reeling in the fish goes way too slow for the amount of times the player has to circle the joystick.

Conclusion

There are so many great games out there as other reviewers have mentioned, GoW, Horizon ZD, Witcher 3. Those games do all of this so much better. R* come out of that basement where you're working your people 100 hour weeks, and look around. You've squeezed your last $60 pre-order out of me. Next time I'll wait for reviews instead of simply buying it because it has R* on the cover.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_124?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=124&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Instead of making you ride a long way every time you need to go somewhere, there'll be breathtaking scenes. If you have 4k resolution and a ps4 pro, this is the most advanced, most detailed, and most beautiful game made to date. The aiming takes a while to get used to, but once you understand how to shoot as intended you'll enjoy all the gunfights. The last game that I can remember that was this revolutionary was grand theft auto 3.

It's the video game equivalent of The Phantom Menace.

Red Dead 1 is an amazing game. I expected the sequel to be at least as good as the original. Instead we have this heap of trash. If I knew the game would be this, I wouldnt have bought it.

The first thing you'll notice is the confusing and frustrating controls. For instance if one is on a horse, and spots prey, or gets into a fight, you'll instinctively pull the left trigger to aim whatever weapon you selected. Except now that's not what happens. Now you have to aim, then elect to draw your weapon, then fire. And most of the time it won't pick out weapons you want.  Way too many steps when you're panicking because someone's shooting at you.

They also took away essential features, such as fast travel. You also have to remember to grab your weapons off your horse before stopping. It's difficult to predict what a control input is going to end up doing. The whole game is extremely frustrating. I've played it for several days, and I'm still waiting for it to be fun.

The magic of Red Dead 1 is gone. There are some improvements here, but really it's just the same game with a different setting, more drudgery, less fun, lazier plot, and frustrating controls.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

You can spend 15 or 20 hours to be rewarded 5.00 ( in game money )  then when you go to purchase items at the store -  an upgrade gun is 900.00 - you do the math.  IT has been explained that it is realistic in 1880 dollars yet an apple or pear costs 50 to 75 cents. 4.00 for a revive tonic - which you need after a mission takes all the profit for the hours of play.  I find the game to be really frustrating and the pricing make no sense except that fact that soon you can go to IGN and purchase gold bars which then DOES make sense - its less about the game being realistic as it is putting REAL gold bars in the developers bank account.  If you make it impossible to make money in the game then by all means give the option to take real money from the players. Im at the point of filing this dog of a game in the circular filing cabinet and play something with a better payoff ( in game results online ) because just buying gold bars because its impossible to afford any items in the games online stores is a joke.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_126?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=126&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I had the same feeling after I played this game for about 10 hours.  I went to Gamestop to trade it in,but the clerk there said I should finish the game.  I did,and I am SO glad I did.  This game is powerful.  Sure,the mechanics didn't really improve from RDR 1,but the graphics and story more than make up for that.  There are some gut-wrenching cut scenes you rarely see in video games.  One of these is when Arthur is speaking with the nun at the train station,and he tells her he is dying and afraid.  She tells him to do something good with the time he has left.

If you don't finish this game then you are missing out on one of the best games ever developed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was really excited and everything, but once I've started playing it, it did not feel at all as a game that I would enjoy. After playing Horizon: Zero Dawn and God of War,  I can tell that this game cannot come even close to these two games, despite the fact that one of the game is almost 2 years old (Horizon). The game looks sooo bleak and lifeless, controls are very sluggish and you have a feeling like you are walking in a swimming pool the whole time. At some point my fingers start hurting for pressing the buttons too hard. The controls are too complicated and there are like 50 different controls for all the actions you can make in the game. I almost always press the wrong button and most of the time kill someone and then i have to run. The story is not bad, but nothing interesting and it's really slow paced, and the dialog is constant so after few hours into the game you are like anoyed when two characters start chatting. I'm playing games from 1997 and I can tell that this is by far one of the biggest dissapointments. Even the graphics are not on the level it should be with all that hours spent in production and the 100GB of data. Probably I was expecting to much and I can say too much realism in the games it's not fun.  We have our lifes for realism, games should be little bit more fun.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Dick","After the hype dies!","December 7, 2018","I played a considerable amount of RDR1 and I thought this would be a no-brainer. Well, I can't give it an ""A"". I'm not going to go in to some of the details the other reviews have, but for me the game just didn't evolve into a modern game. It's mostly like RDR1 with horse bonding.
Value = B+ I paid for the $80 version. I wouldn't say this game is a ripoff, I just have a hard time justifying the extra dollars for what I got compared to other games at $60.
Game play/Fun to Play = B+  It's mostly like RDR1. It's possible to fast travel at a point in the game but you never really feel like you should. In addition, you can take the train or ride the coach but the incentive is to ride your horse, bond and address any side missions that pop-up. There's lots of riding your horse just like in the first game. The game is big too.
Graphics = B  I almost gave graphics a C+. My game looks a bit fuzzy on PS4 Pro. I thought it might be my Sony 4k 55"" television so I moved the game to my gaming monitor to test it. The game just doesn't pop for me. It's fuzzy looking with very few details. It's also not utilizing any HDR for contrast to help the game pop. Meh!
Cinematics = A- There's some good facial animations here & cut scenes. I wouldn't say this is ground breaking or industry leading, but it's good enough for an A- in my book. It feels disconnected more than it should to cut scenes.
Music/Soundtrack = B  I play on 7.1 surround sound usually and I think the soundtrack would actually be pretty good if they could just integrate a few more dynamics. When I play with headphones on I get more of those nuances but I just can't give it an A.
Story = B  I guess I was hoping for a bit more zest in the characters. Most of the characters including Arthur Morgan are a bit unmemorable. I can't say it's an altogether bad story. I just think there should have been more interesting characters.
Controls = B+ This game plays very similarly to the first one. I thought the controls were wonky in the first game and this one feels about the same. Everything works pretty well from the horse. Dead Eye is nearly the same as the first game IMO. The gun play just never feels smooth on foot. After many, many hours of play, I still don't feel like it's a much of a fun shooter. In addition, I think more thought should have gone into menu access and how it interferes with game play.
In my weighted average spreadsheet the game scored just over 87. I weighted value and game play heavier at 25% than the other categories. I could perhaps bump this game up to an A- on PC if it looks and sounds better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_134?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=134&reviewerType=all_reviews"

What a huge disappointment for me and us gamers that this is all games have to offer anymore. The controls are very very sluggish, and frustrating. Nothing fluid about it. A terribly cliche story line that has been told in any western movie ever made. Having such a large map is actually a draw back here as the lack of a quick travel option makes it well.....not fun. It's just a hassle to be forced to run around for 20 min to get my perfect pelt back to sell....that is if my horse doesn't fall over for no reason and ruin the pelt. Repeat as necessary. Who has the time to spend 5 hrs trying to hunt a perfect pelt to craft a pouch so I can hold 3 more carrots?! WTF? Not fun guys. As you can only craft with ""perfect pelts"" it just becomes a hunting game. If i wanted that, I'd by hunting game. Side missions are horrendous....doing favours for ppl you don't care about for no reward. Just not fun. Do I care if my horses scrotum shrink in cold weather? Why would that matter!! Who cares!

This game not only met all of those standards, but the ending leaves a lasting effect on you, standing as one of the best video games he has had the pleasure to play (and I have had the pleasure to watch unfold) to date. While the game does have a slower pace at times, the ending is cinematic and absolutely beautiful, especially when you think about how far the character has grown. If you are looking for a game where story isn't everything but game play is and you do not appreciate character development, look elsewhere- this game is a fantastic story that surpasses RDR and touches every one of your feelings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Rose","Incredible technical masterpiece, but a little bit of a slog","November 12, 2018","Graphics: Unbelievable. Shocking what they can get a PS4 or Xbox to do. The art direction and world they've created is a marvel. Tiny details everywhere really make the world immersive and a joy to be in.

Music: Incredible. The music always fits the time, the situation that's going on at the moment, etc. There's a couple original songs with lyrics during important parts in the story.

Voice acting: Unmatched. Every character is voiced very well. Though all of the ""gruff old cowboy"" voices can sound the same at times.

Story: Really well-done. I don't recall many games that have such a strong character arc. The characters really grow and develop over time, for good and bad.

Amount of stuff to do: Overwhelming. You could play this game for hundreds of hours if you wanted to explore everything and collect all the things.

Gameplay: Kind of a slog honestly. At times I'd wonder to myself. Why am I even playing this? The game loop boils down to:

1. Find and start mission by talking to someone or going somewhere.
2. Watch cutscene.
3. Spend 5 - 10 minutes traveling to the mission.
4. Watch cutscene.
5. Something happens and the area turns into a shooting gallery.
6. Use lock-on targeting on bad guy, then move cursor up very slightly for a headshot.
7. Kill 30 people.
8. Travel back to mission start for 5 - 10 minutes.
9. Watch cutscene.
10. Repeat.

Sometimes it felt like I should just watch a highlight summary of the story on YouTube instead of actually playing the game. Or that it would have made a good TV show or movie, rather than game.

I get that they want you to explore their incredible world while traversing between missions, but it just didn't feel compelling to me. I would usually turn on the cinematic camera mode (which has auto-pathing) then watch YouTube or read a web site until I arrived at the mission. Fast travel exists, but is very limited.

Most of the gameplay in the game boils down to riding your horse and mashing the X button (on PS4), or the afore-mentioned lock-on targeting and headshots.

There are tons of unlockables, hidden items, legendary animal hunts, trinkets and talismans to craft for bonuses, but none of it felt necessary or that compelling. It unlocked cosmetic items, or passive stat boosts that weren't in any way needed to complete the game anyway.

Summary:

The game is a technical and artistic masterpiece. But the gameplay is pretty dull. If you are young with tons of time on your hands or just love immersing yourself with a game world and exploring and completing things, you can spend hundreds of hours here. If you're a busy parent that is just in it for the story and some diversion, it's still worth it for the story and experience, but power through the main story and then call it quits.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_132?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=132&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I do a lot of shopping on amazon and I rely on it for good reviews also. Many are aware of the high praise this game has received from most critics. It is one of the best reviewed games of all time. Critics are not always right. However, just because it has been hailed by critics does not mean it deserves to be dissected in a way that another game that had not been as critically acclaimed. Red Dead Redmeption 2 is not perfect. However, it is a great game and a staggering technical achievement. It’s size and scope are unmatched. The closest case would be GTA 5, but I still would not say that even it’s world or level of detail was the same as RDR2. To me, there is no denying the fact that this is one of the most impressive interactive worlds ever. The story is good. It is a longer, slow burn story that is more similair to GTA 4. In turn, it’s aspects of realism are more familiar to GTA 4 as well which is going to please some and disappoint others. Grand Theft Auto 4 is another hugely acclaimed game that was called boring, and too dull, too realistic. I strongly disagree with those opinions and I felt that before this game, that was Rockstar’s greatest achievement. It was grounded in reality, told a great dramatic story in an incredibly realistic world and served as a reimagining for the franchise. I had never felt more involved with a Rockstar game. This game has not only met that criteria for me but perhaps exceeded it. While I loved GTA 5 for other reasons, it’s humor, and the fun factor it had, I always liked 4 better. I feel that this game leans more towards GTA 4’s style but doesn’t forget those that loved 5, as it includes humor and ridiculousness. This game has not forgotten Red Dead Redmeption either, honoring it, and improving it in all the right ways to become a great prequel story that honors its fantastic roots. Sure, this game is a little clunky control wise and it can feel slow, and deliberately focused. Play it, beat it, and if you’re like me you’ll keep playing long after because there is so much to explore after the adventure, after you’re reminded why it had to take so long to establish its purpose characters and story. When I’m appreciating this game, the negatives that exist are so small in comparison to its accomplishments that I could never say they take away from it being a masterpiece in my eyes, as someone who has beaten it, and played and loved Rockstar games for a long time","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_130?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=130&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I repeat, do not leave your horse on the train tracks.","November 5, 2018","I liked pretty much everything about this game. I still haven't beaten it, but I've got probably 40 hours on it. It is a wonderful way to live out your childhood dreams of being a cowboy/bandit, but with better dental hygiene and none of the dysentery. From the very beginning, this game is a masterpiece. From the footprints and impacts you and other creatures/people leave in the snow, to the mechanics involving cold and horse extremities, everything is super realistic. If you shoot someone, the entry wound and exit wound are based on real ballistics, and juicy as reality. Walk-around with a shotgun is very much like a Gallagher performance, and satisfying when someone punches your horse and you turn them into dust coated paste.

The action parts are good, but it doesn't do anything other games haven't already done in that regard.  I'm not saying it's a bad game, I'm just saying it's not for everyone.

Let me start with a couple of caveats though.

 I've seen a few youtube videos of some pretty glaring glitches (draw errors, clipping, etc). I have seen NONE of these issues on the pro. The only issue I've had with the game so far in technical terms is once (just once) I found a boulder with a collision box larger than its in-game model. That's it. Once.

Also, if you're not into narratives and crafted story where your character is legit held to a social standard and there are consequences for being a sociopath, then I not sure why you would even play red dead in the first place, but this is not your game. The NPCs in this game aren't placeholders, and this isnt GTA. Yeah, if you're barreling through town and smack a townie with your horse and just keep going you're gonna get in trouble.

That being said, this is easily one of the best, if not the best designed game for a single player experience I've played.

 It is spectacularly gorgeous, turning in some amazing textures on a broad scale. Snow and mud and rain have realistic deformation effects on terrain and character models and landscapes look atmospheric and authentic.
Camp management is easy and well worth it if you want to mine the total experience, though if you have an issue with seeing a fairly graphic if simplified representation of animal field dressing you might get a little triggly while hunting.

Interacting with society is layered between your wanted status, your bounty, and your honor. Yeah, it can be easy to do wrong if you aren't paying attention, especially if the onerous chore of watching where you're going is too much for you, and you can rack up a hefty bounty in different territories, but if you have been doing good by the locals they actually dont seem to care. I've pulled bounty hunting missions from the sherrif while I had an active bounty of about 300 bucks and they never batted an eyelash because I didn't go around murdering the townsfolk. Fast forward to a few hours later after I HAVE been a complete murderous rectal chapeau, and my dishonorable self could NOT step into valentine without the classic six gun welcome. Bounty hunters will, however, plague you from time to time and especially if you sit still, be careful when hunting because it's easy to get distracted and a whole posse might go heels on you.

The control system is ANYTHING but clunky.  I think there is a fair amount of conflation between the concept of complex and complicated. This is the former, not the latter. It is a context-based system of presses, holds, and trigger modifiers. For moments of confusion, or stacks of bodies and loot, there is always a list of command options in the lower right corner that literally tell you, in simple, unambiguous terms, what button to press. If this is too much to deal with, I might suggest a hobby or pastime less demanding than video gaming, like staring at the sun, or a wall if the sun isn't your thing.
So I could probably go on and on, but in the end this game is amazing and it will win awards sweetened by the tears of haters who, I guarantee, are NOT taking their copies back.

I cant wait for multiplayer.

10/10 would wait years for a sequel this good again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_131?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=131&reviewerType=all_reviews"

RDR2 is a nice combination of Rockstar's previous titles: The open world experience is a bigger and more detailed version of GTA. The core shooting mechanics is similar to what we have seen in Max Payne 3. The level of interaction with the environment is inherited from L.A. Noire.

The story telling is rich, and reminds me of titles like Witcher 3 and Fallout 4. Almost all the main and side quests are fun and entertaining. I sometimes find myself riding my horse around to do hunting and explore the world, or meet new people, and acquire new my weapons.

My girlfriend loves the game too and we had plenty of fun playing it together or individually.

Excellent voice acting, but the story is meh.  HDR mode caused my tv to display a lot of rendering artifacts.  The mini games and activities are awful.

Within 5 minutes I went from being a respected lawman to accidentally shooting a dog I really just wanted to pet.  Since it was in town, there were witnesses.  I was hoping to convince them to not report me, but they got shot too and in a THAT-ESCALATED-QUICKLY situation, it wasn’t long before I was in a shootout with the law and had a big bounty on my head.  Well, I guess I will just be a bad guy.  Except the controls are too clunky for me to kill all the lawmen after me.  Good thing there isn’t really a save system to undo this-  not that I want to repeat another minute spent chopping wood anyway.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_125?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=125&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Tons of customization and upgrades, interesting and bountiful side quests and random events, an absolutely beautiful world to explore, great music, and compelling characters. However, the main story overstays its welcome by 40 or so hours, and only a handful of those extra hours are fun. For the first half of the game, the story is captivating and interesting, but it eventually buckles and collapsed under its own weight. If Rockstar had shown restraint they could've had a masterpiece on their hands, instead, it's just a great game and an unmatched technical marvel. The game became much more enjoyable after I completed the story, but I simply can't justify 5/5 for that slog.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Great value for the money!","November 21, 2019","You have to experience this game. The story, gameplay, and experience for not to missed.

The game will take most people 60-80 hours to get through, as long as don't plow right through the main story line and miss all the side quests.

Tip: play this game like you were actually LIVING in the shoes of Arthur. Take your time. Explore. Go fishing and hunting. Find the MANY hidden side quests, and oddities hidden in the massive world. There's far more than the very long and wonderful story. If you play only the main story quests, you're missing the core bit of this game.

It's rare for a game to get you captivated by the environments, and activities. Find yourself playing poker, or fishing for several hours.

one piece of an advice to my fellows gamers ""DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE""

Pros :
High Production values .

Cons : (I will only mention a few of many here )
1- Very very bad controls
2-shooting is not fun (I enjoyed shootings in some games like Uncharted and TLOUS and Battlefield but maan!
isn't this game suppose to be a cowboy game when shooting is the main focus thing and most polished element in the game ?!!
shooting is not fun and the aim assistant is just ridiculous (I know I can remove it but still controls sucks any time you try to shoot without it )
the red eye is just too powerful and ridiculous .

They should have copied uncharted shooting mechanism if they cant invent a proper one for the 3rd person view
and copied battlefield or call of duty shooting mechanics for the 1st person view.

3- camera ffff... camera transition between 3rd person to 1st person is not smooth and it sucks and the 1st person view is just too clunky. (the transition made the screen disappeared for like milliseconds which killed it for me to switch during shootouts ) and the first person is just the worst

their are many other cons I will not mention here because the above were enough to make me stop playing the game,

I don't understand the 10s that the game have got its 6 at best..
Reviewers either st*pid and just follow the hype, or they are just greedy bast%ds who just got paid...

it make no sense and no excuse for rockstar to not develop a proper shooting mechanism with all the billions of dollars they make)

and one last thing; RAGE engine is just S*CKS!! while the landscapes looks beatiful, the character models and character skin is just BAD... with all the billions they made they should by now developed and engine like EA's forstbite engine or even better !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

$60 wasted.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_125?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=125&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When controlling the character, or doing simple things like shooting become awkward, it is time to put the game back in the sleeve, and let it collect dust on the shelf.  A tremendous disappointment and waste of money!","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_122?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=122&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The game looks beautiful and there is a lot of contents.

But it's just painful to play. Everything takes forever, with a lot of unnecessary interactions. The controls are infuriating. Every button is overloaded with tons on meanings. For example L2 is to interact with characters but it also means to aim your gun if not ""near"" a character. This leads to dumb situations pointing your gun at random characters and pissing them off. This usually means screwing a mission or getting a bounty on your head. Very frustrating.

The game is just not so much fun to play.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

**STORY SCORE: 5**
Well, I mean the character development so far in like in the story, like, we learned like the backstory of everyone. And that’s, I like that about the story, cause you learn everyone, about everyone.
But I like how they develop the characters though. I’ve watched some gameplay. I don’t know. I just like that, I just like some of the characters in the story. That’s it.

**BATHING SCORE: 8**
It sounds great that you can take a bath and get clean.
But it sounds like an 8. It’s a great 8.

**FACIAL HAIR SCORE: 10**
Facial hair for the game would be great, because as you said you can change your look in the game just by shaving so
say you have a giant beard, you do something illegal, they're gonna find you and then just run away shave off your beard and then you (sorry for the background noise) and then you can just like avoid the police.
So yeah. Facial hair in the game is amazing.

**XBOX vs PS4**
(shakes head)

** GRAPHICS SCORE: **
(no response)

**COMBAT SCORE: 7**
Based on what I’ve seen because and what I’ve played of GTA 5, I’d give GTA 5’s gunplay a 5. I’d give this maybe a 7.
There’s like small things you can do like, an extra trigger, like fire of the trigger, will like cock the gun, or something like that.
Gunplay’s a huge deal for me. Like, if there’s a gun, if the game has good gunplay, that, it’s what makes it fun.
Like I wanna go into making game systems so it’s like shooting models is one of the things you need to deal with.
*THIS IS BASED OFF OBSERVATIONS, NOT ACTUAL IMPRESSIONS OF THE GAMEPLAY*
Because otherwise people are just gonna be like: “So this person thinks that this like actually play this and think this is bad!” And I’m like “No, I have never played it. I have not played it. I WILL play it once it’s on PC.""

**RED SCORE: 8**
Because blood. I don’t know.
It’s kind of hard to make a review on a game you’ve never played.

**CARS SCORE: 5**
Because I like cars. BMW F36.

**HORSES SCORE: 9**
Again it’s really realistic, and like, you can actually move around with the horse and it takes a long time to actually train one.
Yeah and apparently, if the weather’s cold, the [male reproductive organs] shrink.

**OVERALL SCORE: 7.43 / 10**","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Yes, it is a slow start and you'll have to play through a few hours to really open up the game. But if you give it time, it is simply amazing. Probably the most beautiful open world game I've played to date. Each quest/side quest has kept me thoroughly entertained. My only gripe, as with all rockstar games, is the controls.

The constant travel isn't fun. At least in Rockstar's other big game GTA you have cool music on radio stations to take your mind off the long distance. But riding ridiculous amounts of miles on a horse all day just for a brief mission with little action isn't gonna cut it. Fallout 3's wasteland had way more action than this and you couldn't even sprint back on Fallout 3.  Some people like boring slow paced overhyped games and if that's your thing go for it. But if you like real action games Borderlands 3, Doom, and Rage 2 should all be good.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The game is long, the story is thought out, the side stories might even be my favorite as how funny and random some of them are, over all this game has knocked it out of the park. The graphics are fantastic, the scenery breathtaking, the fighting and shooting is pretty straight forward as well. I will say there are a LOT of controls you have to learn but once you get it down, it's all pretty fluid.

Honest to God the biggest downfall of this game is the horse mechanics. I played Zelda Breath of The Wild last year and was amazing at how they went into enough detail with the horse mechanics that if you ran through a forest your horse didn't run STRAIGHT into a tree (like a real horse). But with Red Dead, the horse mechanics are the thing that is most lacking in my personal opinion and the greatest downfall of the game. However, on the flip side of that, it's all the one that make you laugh and yell the most because your horse will do the most craziest sh*t you've ever seen and it's always at a very pivotal moment too.

Do yourself a favor and buy the game, play it, explore, enjoy the characters the story the voice acting, all of it. The game is a work of art and I cannot wait to see what they come up with next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They always seem to deliver.
The story is rich & compelling, along with social commentary & satire.

Is it a perfect game? No. The load screens take a long time, the quirks like taking away your rifles as you dismount into a firefight, unreliable horse A.I., & the drawn out prologue are all weak spots.

But the sheer enormity of the maps, the detail to world-building, the multi-faceted options in free roaming available, & detail to character development more than make up for it. I'm in my 3rd month of playing the game & still haven't grown tired of it. If you're looking for a game to hold your attention, then grab this one & saddle up, cowboy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

For an open world game it doesn't feel that open world when it comes to questing. You can't start multiple quests and then travel around completing them, and I've yet to have more than 5 quests available at one time. It has the Rockstar button mashing to run which I wish they would leave in the past and the character movement is alot like that of any GTA, sure wish they would bring that into 2018 like every other developer. Not saying it's a bad game but it sure was hyped up.

Yes the first few hours are slow paced, but once you get past that and get used to the controls + mechanics it gets much better. Anyone expecting a grand theft auto or action game this won't be for you. Rockstar have really outdone themselves this time around. There is so much to see and do in this world I couldn't help, but get sidetracked by the side activities along with exploring the world. I played it for 8 hours straight, that's pretty rare for me. Anyway if you enjoyed the previous Red dead redemption or you enjoy mature, well done story driven games with choices then you will enjoy this game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Tran","Good story but ruined by many flaws","February 15, 2019","I had a blast playing this and the amount of content makes it worth every penny. I was a little scared when people say this game has limited fast travel but after playing for awhile I figured this was a good design. This game has so many things going on that something always pop up when I was riding down the road. There were only a few dull moments but majority of the storyline and sidequests were fantastic.

However, I often found myself wanted to punch the mechanics designer for the following flaws:
1. Arthur always stow his gun away onto the horse that I always go into fights with only my hand guns. Even after specifically setting them into slots in the gunsmith, if I choose to use another weapon or gets a new weapon, the setting resets. And why can't I sell unwanted weapons? I found this supercool shotgun and doesn't need the lower tier anymore but I can't get rid of it, so I have to scroll through a dozen weapons just to find the one I want to use, really?
2. Why can't I run in camp?!?!?
3. Losing honor WAY TOO EASILY! If I kill an innocent bystander then I understand, but how can I lose honor when I loot a dead body in the middle of nowhere?
4.  Crafting was kind of dope but annoying when need to craft multiple of the same items. The advance bullet would be good to use but that requires me to hold onto x forever to craft all of them is insane
5. There's nothing to buy. Money was tight at beginning of game when I tried to upgrade the camp. But 20%ish into it later and finished those upgrades, there's nothing I ""can"" buy. The stronger weapons are locked until later game and items weren't that expensive.
6. Journal log is a joke since it shows quests that I already finished. As for the quests I want to know more about, it simply provide a short one/two sentence summary. Why does this even exist?
7. Outfits don't give any special bonuses. Even for the outfits you can craft, These things require a shitton of ""perfect"" pelts with the legendary animal parts only provide additional aesthetics with no extra perks. Why should I bother? Meanwhile the other gears such as the satchel and holster require minimal effort to make and have good bonuses.
8.  Mashing that ""x"" button just for dashing. For my horse to dash through this vast land, I need to abuse my controller instead of a simple hold to dash.

Do Rockstar developers know the definition of ""annoying""?","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Seems like a cool game with a pretty solid plot about cowboys and the brutal hardships of the Wild West. It has a lot of content, spanning about two discs which both come in the case. Download time is a bit long since it is a very large game, but overall my man seems to be enjoying it...maybe a little too much as he has started to develop some character changes within himself. He has begun speaking in a southern accent, similar to the cowboys in the game, and has started partaking in various hunting trips with his guy friends which he has never done before. He comes back dawned in a cowboy hat, muddy boots with spurs, and a lasso strapped on his belt next to the new pistol he recently went out and bought. I thought he was getting a little carried away, but thought maybe the game had inspired him to try new things. Then I found out that he had invested in a horse...He's begun to use phrases such as, ""Howdy"", ""Git"", ""Y'all"", and has developed a southern dialect all together. He sits and plays the game each night while pouring himself a glass of bourbon. I am unsure of what to do...but I guess that just means it is a really good game y'all.

The world is much larger and more varied than ever before, with thick forests and open fields, great lakes, towns, vast ecosystems and much more. There is so much going on in the games world that there is simply too much to list. It does have a bit of slow start, but a few hours in and things open up like players would come to expect from a open world game.

It feels and plays like its predecessor, but packed with way more layers of interactivity, to the point where if players did go back and play the original game, it would feel more like a demo than the final product. Now sadly, unlike the original, Red Dead Redemption 2 has no difficulty settings, so everyone who plays will be on the same setting, but maybe such a feature will be patched in at a later time.

Combat from horseback also feels better, and the ""Dead Eye"" returns with a few upgrades this time such as highlights with critical hit areas on a target. There is also a horse bonding system, so how you treat your horse has realistic outcomes. All horses are unique and gives the player a real bond between the two. Your horse can die, and there’s no bringing them back if it happens.

Rockstar has even created over 200 species of animals, all with unique behaviors, every one of them capable of interacting with each other as well as the player. Each region has its own ecosystem, so you will only find animals in their natural habitats and behaving as the species would in the real world. On your travels, you may find a wild horse rolling in mud for fun, down to an alligator dragging a deer into a river, and much, much more.

The A.I is also very impressive, players can speak with any character and select a positive or negative interaction. These play out differently each time, based on your clothes, blood stains, mud, location, what the NPC is doing, your honor rating, how much alcohol you’ve consumed, and much more. There is a broad range of possible interactions. While GTA 5 and the original Red Dead was still top notch, they where both originally created for PS3 and Xbox 360, so the team was very limited by hardware limitations. Now for the first time ever, Rockstar has truly been able create a next gen version of open world games, and it really shows that they used all of the available resources at their disposal.

Graphically, the game looks fantastic, with well lit interiors and fantastic moonlight, down to even being blinded from the sun, and it will all vary depending on the weather. Even the blood smears are thought out, wagons wheels being covered in mud, rust that builds up on firearms, there is simply an outstanding attention to detail. There is so much attention to detail, that the game cannot be held on a dual-layered Blu-ray, it comes on two disks! The installation size is 105GB, and will take around 40 minutes to install each disk.

Final Verdict:

This is a game that packs to much content to go over in a single review, without it becoming a 50 page report. Red Dead Redemption 2 does stand as being one of the greatest games of our modern age. It’s polished beyond expectations with great storytelling, it's fun to play, great controls, tons of content, everything one would come to expect from a Triple-A game. After all, we are talking about Rockstar, and it is obvious by now they are unparalleled in raising the bar for years to come. In this case, make it a decade.....or two.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_95?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=95&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I really enjoyed the first one.
The first few hours of this game are sloooooowwwww.

I played on because I had some friends say it gets better. I kept chugging along in Chapter 2. Did some hunting, did some quests, yadda yadda. It got slightly better, but felt kind of directionless.
Sure there were some quests here and there but there didn't seem to feel like any connectivity between them. It felt a bit too 'open world'.

I read something about fishing and thought to myself, "" wow, I haven't gone fishing yet!"" Lets try that.

I did a quick search to see how to fish. I thought you just had to find the guy who sold you a pole and away you went.
Nope.
There's a quest, early on in Chapter 2, that unlocks this skill for you.
Ahh no problem, let me go and get that quest.

Well it turns out, the person that gives you the quest is in your camp. Great! Let's go get it.
Nope.
That person is nowhere to be seen.
Quick Google search later...
""RDR2 Has a Deadly Bug That's Easy To Trigger""
Wait, what?

Turns out, there's an early quest in Chapter two “Polite Society, Valentine Style”, that if you screw up, will make several people in your camp not show up.

No big deal you say. I don't care about hearing their stupid dialogue!
Well, those people give you quests, many quests it turns out. Quests that lead to other quests, such as the fishing tutorial quest.

I'm now 20+ hours in, almost finished with Chapter two, and I'm now learning of this HUGE bug.
Rockstar did patch this, but they DID NOT FIX THE ISSUE IF YOU'VE ALREADY TRIGGERED THE F'ING BUG!

That's right. I have to restart the game if I want to see any of those quests.
Yes, the people are back in camp after that patch, but the quests they had are not popping up.

No wonder the game felt directionless. Many of the early quest givers weren't there to give me the quests I needed at the start of the stupid game and now that they're back, they're still not giving me the quests I missed.

Huge disappointment.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_135?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=135&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Land","It's alright","October 26, 2018","I've been playing for about 8 hours now I have a pretty Luke warm reception to this game.  It's not that it's a bad game by any means (it's incredible in many ways) it's just that it isn't really capturing me. The game just isn't that fun and I'm not blow away by the world because I've seen this all before only in MUCH MUCH more interesting scenarios like in Horizon Zero Dawn.

So far the game is a little boring.  A lot of what is dragging down my fun factor is the game play.  Maybe it's a Rockstar thing because I recently replayed GTA5 on the PS4 and I couldn't get through it due to the clunky game play and I kind of feel like it will be the same here.  Everything about the world gameplay wise just feels off to me and poorly thought out.  Moving the character through the world feels like walking through a swimming pool and the standard SLOOOW pace of the movement is beyond irritating just adds to the boring, slow feeling of the opening sections of the game.  I've heard people say ""well the slow walking forces you to be immersed in the world"", you are immersed in the world simply by playing it if... what developer thought that walking speed was a good idea. Gun play and the cover system just feels clunky and strange (again... to ME personally) and that is a serious bummer because gun fights feel more frustrating than fun. Some might not mind it but it just didn't feel fluid enough for me.

The foundation of ANY game is solid, game play and controls and this is my main issue with the game itself.  When you are playing a game with solid gameplay, you should almost forget you are holding the controller.

It's not like that with this game.  Here you are CONSTANTLY aware of the controller because you will probably still be fumbling with the controls 12 hours in.  Here is a perfect example of the stupid game design. Drawing your weapon and talking to someone is mapped to the SAME BUTTON.  So if your gun is unholstered, you may accidently draw on them when you meant to just talk, which starts a fight.  Now I want realism in games, but I want intelligent realism.  I want the realism of the idea that drawing a gun should be a monumental action in this world that is a matter of life and death and, therefore, it should be next to impossible to accidentally draw your gun once you are aware of the controls.  The develops didn't think of this though, but they DID think to make your horse crap and give each animal it's own skinning animation.  So at least we have that.  Rockstar CLEARLY put all the money into making the world better at the sake of more solid game play and I don't like it.

The game is beautiful and the musical score is stunning but, again, we've been here before over and over again so those things just don't have as much as an impact on me when core game mechanics are lacking. I'm hoping that it has a killer story to kind of save the game for me and I'm not saying this isn't a great game, I'm simply saying that it's ""okay"" for me hence the three stars.  So far I am connecting with the characters and I am sure the review will go up to at least a 4 but, I'm sorry, there is no way this game is a 10/10

In the end, I am not saying you shouldn't buy this game but I'm just saying I haven't been blown away.  To me that is a testament to how amazing games as a whole have become rather than my disappointment with this particular title.

I did run into some game ending bugs and maybe there will be some patches to improve the experience so, if you aren't playing it by now maybe wait a could weeks for them to patch it up.  In the mean time you can play the Spiderman DLC, which is what I will do and return to RDR in a couple weeks

EDIT: 11/5/18

I've continued to play the game and, story wise, it gets better.... much much better.  Unfortunately it takes about 20-25 hours until you get into the good story material but it is well worth it because you finally get to play through some epic moments in this game. The voice acting and characters are just so phenomenal in this game and I've really grown to love the character of Arthur Morgan even more than John Marston.

I was so impressed with the story that I considered raising my review of this game to four stars and I may end up doing that but for now, for every stupid game mechanic I get used to, another one takes it place. Simple things that could make the game much more convenient to play are overlooked.  Want to clear out your weapon inventory and only carry your favorite weapons?  Sorry, once you pick up a weapon in this game it is your forever, you can't sell it and your can't even drop it.  Why not just equip the weapons you love and be done with it?  Because the developers designed the game so that the game frequently unequips all your two handed guns forcing you to remember to equip  EACH and EVERY TIME and this has been continually frustrating because I'm often stuck in battles with only my pistol rather then my rifle because the game CONSTANTLY does this.  But remember, you have add realism of needing to take a bath, but it's impossible to drop a weapon once you pick it up.

Another thing that's really getting on my nerves is the bounty system.  I won't go into it too much but the game pretty much harshly punishes you for crime, which wouldn't be a big deal if it didn't also punish you for things that are clearly not a crime.  The most annoying thing is riding a horse through town, one mistake of bumping into someone will cause them to run to the cops and cause a chase.  It's beyond annoying.

So again, the game gets better but the stupid game play decisions and bad controls continually make the game less and less fun than it could be.  A reviewer at IGN said it best ""RDR2 doesn't care if you are having fun"" and I think that perfectly sums it up.  It's sad because this game truly COULD have been amazing if the developers just put more effort into the things of the games that actually matter rather than focusing so much on pointless details.

My recommendation is to WAIT for them to patch this game and then enjoy a better experience than us early adopters had because the story elements of this game are truly spectacular, they are just held back by terrible game play.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_123?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=123&reviewerType=all_reviews"

As a lifelong millennial gamer, I've seen a lot.  Regarding more recent games that require extensive voice-acting, Rockstar has always been a cut above in terms of quality, but this game take it to another level.  While the gameplay is nothing novel for Rockstar compared to GTA and previous Red Deads, the sheer magnitude of literally everything make this game a cut above anything done before.  Some categories where this depth shines:

- Characters.  Each feels unique and is revealed slowly like a film.  The voice acting is nuanced, dynamic, and believable.  You never get the impression that someone was just reading the lines because it's a video game and gamers just want to ride a horse and rob people anyway.  Even the most peripheral, limited use characters are quirky, unique, and memorable.

- Environment.  The size, the detail, the fact that you almost never hear similar side-dialogue over and over again (like in Skyrim from guards and shopkeepers).  Even once you do, it's so high quality that it doesn't feel trite at all.

- Story: captivating, artistic, deep.  Take your time.  You'll choke up.  You'll laugh.  You'll hate, be angry, and regret, love, and feel guilty, on a scale like that of a quality western film.  As someone who has played RPG's and can just want to grind grind grind to get to the next stage, level, etc, this game easily slows you down.  Each time you load in, note the camera angle and lack of interface.  Ahhh.  A freakin' video game can induce this emotion, a video game!  Others have tried, and Rockstar has infinitely succeeded.

These are just some of the standouts.  Go live a classic western now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Here are some things you should know before going in.

Travel - there is limited fast travel in the form of trains and carriages in main towns, you cant just press pause or tab and pick a spot you have been to on the map. however every area is accessible right out of chapter 2 with some limited to the brave and foolish.

Narrative - there is a lot and not just in mains story line quests in side quests you will find yourself traveling with a companion to the next job and actually having a chat with them, if narrative is not for you you might find this part ""boring and tedious"". I myself am a fan of fast paced games but didn't have a problem with this as job are usually located close to the quest start.

Shooting/interacting - it CAN take some getting used to, there were times where a slip of the finger meant I just blew some poor guys head off buy complete accident. Don't go into this expecting it to be some ez-breezy brain dead mechanics shooter. too shoot you need to aim first(R2) or unholster your gun(R1) in most chases and press R1 before talking to anyone friendly to holster your weapons

Side stuff - Again there is A lot of it, but its not always just handed to you, you can fish, hunt, craft, Poker, Dominos, Show girls, collect debts, help random strangers you meet or just go on a mindless rampage.

Morality - There is a morality system, while I have not noticed any differences(mainly because I'm still on the first play through) My guess it if your nice, you get greeted too and people are friendly if your naughty people come after you(a guess).

Hunting - I'm just barley getting my feet wet with this feature but holy crap some of them move fast, especially legendary animals and if they catch you, Oof.

All in all I give it a 4/5, Only because I got the game for online. The game is beautiful, well done with few hiccups and could keep you busy for days if you let it. I don't really know how long I've played this but I've had it for about 4 days and I haven't been able to put it down.

If Online is just as good I'll give it 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_138?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=138&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Enjoy doing chores?
Really like a buggy game that likes to waste your time?

This game is for you!

This game has so many flaws. From taming horses never working, shooting animals and people in the head multiple times and have them keeping on coming, tripping on an invisible rock on your horse, killing you both, just a blast.

This game does have a large world, and characters that will chat about their daily lives and chores.

But I really wouldn't force my worst enemy to play this for longer than a few minutes. It's really one of the most frustrating, irritating, waste of time 'games'.

I can see how people with no lives, way too much time on their hands, enjoy tedious meaningless chores, don't know about meaningful relationships, dialog, story, gameplay, or the meaning of ""fun"" might enjoy this game.

But if you enjoy gameplay, story, or a fun game, you're better off spending your time playing one of the million bejeweled clones out there.

I enjoy most games in one way or another, but I'd rather be working, or chores than have to play another minute of this.

Totally disappointed !!!","November 2, 2018","I was so excited to get this game but after over 15 hrs I decided to give up (20% progress). Every time when I thought to give up due to frustration, I told myself maybe I need a little bit more time to get used to it. NOW, I THINK IT IS THE TIME !!!

Pro: pretty good graphics (but not amazing), beautiful landscape.

Con:
1. Boring and tedious. As a game, it is supposed to give gamer fun, right? I played RDR1, GTA5, Horizon zero dawn, assassin creed: origin, the witcher 3: wild hunt. god of war etc and I enjoyed them a lot. But for RDR2, i didn't have that feeling. I lost interest very quickly and I don't even remember when is the last time I had this feeling. It is a Big Failure for RDR2 !
2. Terrible health setting! I need to eat, my horse too, otherwise, the health will go down. Bad ideal ! Not fun!
3. No fast /easy travel, have to ride the horse and go a long distance. Not fun !
4. Clunky movement, especially when you move Arthur in a house or at camp. he moves like a very old man. Not fun!
5. Boring shooting and fighting. Not fun.
6. Boring main missions and side missions. Not fun.

I am glad it decided to give up and now I have time to play others games !!!","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

The game steals from you every chance it gets.  Weapons will randomly drop from your hands, food and tinctures vanish from your inventory.  Settings menu is a joke in this era.  Accessibility options only from the colorblind, none for motion sickness.  3 Options in audio menu.

The cinematic mode you're expected to use to get around is used to kill you unexpectedly as often as possible.  With max health and stamina you can be expected to die in less time than the average human reaction speed.  Even in the middle of a city.  By a chaingun.  Everyone already knows the pathing is terrible, reused from GTA without any improvements.

The story works perfectly long enough for professional reviewers to write how good it is... then it's broken.  From randomly equipped weapons to hundreds of dollars of random bounties that are supposed to be prevented by wearing masks.  Some missions don't count as quests at all, going in guns blazing will net you a ton of negative morality and huge bounties OFTEN.  From the hundred hours I've been playing, the mask and face cover have NEVER worked once to prevent bounties.  I have a $125 bounty in a place I haven't been close to in a dozen hours.

The settings menu is from the 90's in it's simplicity.
No tap to aim in a shooter is unheard of today.
Toggle run is a lie.
Turning kill effects off does nothing.
Sound, score, dialogue are the only audio options which is pathetic in a AAA game.
Turning off dynamic kill cam does nothing.
First person horse riding places your vision in the chest so you can't see over the horse's head.
Colorblind mode but no toggle for screen shake so prepare for motion sickness.
Autosave might as well be called ""Save once a RL day.""

The idea of an open world western sounded like a game I would enjoy but after playing the game for a few days and completing the first chapter and starting the second chapter I just couldn't take it anymore. The game is as slow as molasses you travel slowly on horse back for perform a miniscule chore and repeat. The character you control walks and runs slower then my 95 year old grandfather. Everything you do is slow slow SLOW! When there is some action the controls are borderline unplayable and the layout of controls is so confusing I could not get used to it. You travel on horseback and walk in the snow until the game gives u a bit of action where a couple of wolves attack. The game is just so tedious and slow it tries to be like real life but I play games to have fun not to spend an hour hunting a deer with a bow, shaving eating setting up a campsite etc. And pigging out on baked beans. You'd literally need invest hours on end to progress in this game. I was midway through a quest it wouldn't even let me save it and now I have to start it from the beginning? Not worth my time! Prior to buying the game I read reviews with similar complaints but decided to try iit out any way since it was so highly acclaimed but it was truly a bad decision and I wasted my money I will be trading the game in.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_129?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=129&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Here are some of the things you will have to do as a player (or real person, hard to tell)
- Find food
- Cook food (with recipes/ingredients)
- Eat food (not too much or you get fat)
- Feed your horse
- Feed others in your camp
- Find $
- Donate $ to the camp
- Shave
- Wear hair gel
- Take your gun to get cleaned
- Look through merchandise catalogs page by page
- Go everywhere by foot or horse, no fast travels
- Pick herbs....like stoop down, rip them out, put them in your satchel
- Skin animals (which takes like 30 seconds)
- Sleep

I am not a player that needs all action all the time, but this is overboard. This game is too lifelike and it's chorey. In the next episode we will be paying bills, doing taxes, laundry, and cleaning floors.

There is another issue that made this less fun, and that is it railroads the player. If you are riding the horse and clip a tree or a rock, you are down. Like down, injured, or dead. If you ride too near a NPC they will shoot you. If you walk too close to a NPC, get on the wrong horse for even an instant, make a wrong move or hit a wrong button...you are railroaded to combat or jail. There is no grey area...this is life. If you make a wrong move...that's it!

I think they took making a lifelilke game too far and it overshadows the fun. I am not *that* far along in the game. Maybe 10%, but I am not longing to play like I was with Assassins Creed. When I think of putting Red Dead back on I think of trudging on the horse again for 10 min to get to town, buying the right tonic, wearing the right clothes so I don't get too hot or cold (yes this is a thing).....I don't think of fun, which is a shame really.

The kicker is that despite all that they allow (require) you to do in the virtual world, the one thing they don't allow you to do in the real world is remap your control buttons. In what PS4 game is the left [ ] button jump?! It is almost always X and is hard to get used to, but complexity ended there for this game as there is no way to change the primary button layout.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_129?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=129&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I received it from Amazon day of release. First, you have to load a Data Disc, and then more loading with the Play Disc. It took about an hour and a half. First thing I noticed, was there is no difficulty setting. So, I figured I would die a lot. The first couple missions are linear, so it gives you time to learn the numerous controls that you will be utilizing. The detail and scenery are pretty awesome. You finally get to do your own thing, once you get near the town of Valentine in Chapter 2. I managed to kill my horse, which left me on foot for quite a spell! After that, I decided to start the game over, now that I was familiar with the complex controls. Looking forward to exploring more, as the game progresses. Worth playing, but I still have a soft spot for the 1st game so far. 11/6 - After 2 weeks with this game, I am finding it laborious, slow & no incentive to keep playing it. You wander into a mission that triggers automatically, and you cannot leave it, or it ends with Mission Failed. The 1st RDR was so much better designed. I will keep on trying to play & enjoy this game, but the cumbersome controls, the overwhelming vastness of it, and the slow pace, urges me to play Dragon Quest XI for the thrid time instead...","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But as a game, its missing the fun factor that made the first game so good. It just isn't interesting enough. The prologue alone is a snore, I actually dozed off a few times while listening to characters discuss events while traveling to the next location.

It is no where near as good a original! It is still a well put together game in many respects but it is also a pain in the ass game! This is a very Slow Western, and the storyline took 4× the amount of time to tell a story as the original. Of course I want more of a game that the original, I just thought they went overboard with this one. By the end I was kind of depressed and angry I wasted 100 plus hours on this game.
  The first problem is that the storyline is not that engaging or dynamic. And basically I find Arthur to be a sad sack, a likable character, but his story is a bit detached and depressing for me. Then to switch to JM in the last quarter of game seemed like a cheap move. Arthur deserved better!
  The game can be reduntant. Pretty much most of the missions end with you killing 40 people in the same way, it's kind of boring. They really should have made more story missions that did not end up with a huge shoot out. Maybe some funny or surprising turnout to make the story more fun.  Alot of tasks and  missions are in the task bar something that took me a while to figure out.  Not on the map where they should be so in that case it makes you think their is nothing to do. Also tasks are chorelike, reward not worth it. The story should have ended about 20 hours earlier, this is like a hundred hour plus game the original was like 40-50 hours tops.  The maps like treasure maps pretty much give you a drawing of a area you have to figure out where it is, not an easy task, I think they should have giving you a bubble to search in, far more effective. Because of the little clues you get with treasure or puzzles this could leave a casual game stumped.
  There are some things they missed in this game: a earned fast travel where you get to go any where on map, faster storyline, wagons where you can build and hook your horses up to, prostitutes that put out, a stage coach business, also river boat business, and taking people from camp on missions like Far Cry .","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_134?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=134&reviewerType=all_reviews"

You learn characters, the setting, etc. It seems pretty slow, but once the world opens up, it is anything but slow.

Graphics are gorgeous. I absolutely love traveling just for the simple fact that the environment is so pretty.

The amount of detail in this game is mind boggling. Very very immersive. Stranger missions, random encounters, chats with fellow gang members, all of this comes so fluidly and naturally that I forget I'm playing a video game.

The map is huge. Lots and lots of places to explore, not to mention lots of rare animals to hunt.

The dialogue and voice acting are great, controls are good but there's a bit of a learning curve. Get the controls down because if you don't, you'll probably accidentally become wanted for assault..

Overall, 5/5, I've been playing this game for hours. Most likely the people who found it boring only played the beginning. Sadly they're missing out on the most immersive game I've played in a very long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_137?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=137&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I happen to have a career and a life so it took me a long time to finish the game and give it it's proper praises. I had kept seeing over and over many complaints about it being ""slow"" ""boring"" ""tedious"" and not giving it a chance. I can only attribute this to limited attention spans and the evolution or de-evolution of games. It seems frenetic shooters and cutsie app games have stunted attention spans. Ironically, the realism and added touches that do make the game slower paced is part of what makes this game so great. I really don't think people truly appreciate what a technical marvel this game is... from its ultra-realistic graphics, the realistic motion captures of the people, horses, geez everything living even bugs. The imprints on the mood, the environment changes, gorgeous sunsets, impactful lighting, and thunderstorms on and on and on. But the heart of the game is the STORY. Rockstar has an ability to make Hollywood quality work and seamlessly immerse you from gameplay to story mode without sacrificing gameplay or story. The story is a sort of prequel to red redemption and did an amazing job laying out the groundwork for the first game. The characters are all lovable and you really get attached to them especially when your like for them is tested given they are outlaws. I cannot say enough good things about this game and the level of quality. oh and the music.... jesus amazing high quality. Even though I knew John's fate, the epilogue really fleshed his story making me like him even more despite loving Arthur. Almost two games in one. Amazing work Rockstar. Amazing. I just hope #playerone games like this are not abandoned to crap like fortnite. We all know what happens when quaility produces move to multiplayer (fallout76).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_129?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=129&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Maybe for those ""older"" gamers like me who appreciate a good story to go along with gameplay.  It's slow, yes, and it took me a while to complete it. But it was well worth it. I think the last 20% of actual gameplay went by fairly quick (that is, the last chapter, not the epilogue).
The graphics are outstanding. I wish I could be there at some of those locations listening to the waterfalls, elk bugles, and misty mountain tops. There are some lag and glitch issues. But for a game of this magnitude, I wouldn't doubt it. No game of this nature is ever perfect. I learned to just get used to it.
The voice acting is great and memorable. Arthur is the best.  I wanted so bad to strangle Dutch and his ""I. Have. A. Plan"" because all their characterizations are excellent.
Combat-wise was just ok. It's not the hardest. But the side missions can be especially the gunslinger ones.
Soundtrack is amazing. Love a lot of the original music especially that last ride.
And for some of those saying there is no fast-travel... YES, THERE IS! Plus you can auto-ride mode and watch the cinematic ride alongs like your watching a movie (and taking a food/bathroom break).
Totally worth the original price. Even better now.  If you have PSPro, be prepared to be blown away at 60 fps on 4K HDR10.
And be prepared to have some tissue paper on hand AND check ""old haunts"" during the epilogue.  This game is easily in my top 5 as best game of all time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

(SPOILER ALERT!!)","October 29, 2018","I am so impressed.  Over 100GB required to run??  New Austin PLUS New Eastern States?? This time around Rockstar Games doesn't just deliver the usual open world game that they do.  They rethought the open world into perfection.  This time they wanted players to be able to fully enjoy the lively world even after game completion and how so?  Well this time your health matters.  You need to eat, sleep.  Oh Don't be selfish now..  your all time partner (your horse!) also need to be fed and treated well.
JUST TO NAME A FEW NEW THINGS TO DO:
New Hobbies:
Fishing
Dominoes

Old Hobbies (REMADE!)
Hunting (FEELS VERY NEW!)
Fight with a Grizzily Bear - Intense! - When that thing charged at me almost had to change my under pants! I litteraly screamed!  This time around the Griz Bears doesn't play around.  You get hand in hand combat with the G. Bear.  (Black Bears Are back.  They aren't aggressive like the G. Bear and they will run once see you but they will defend themselves if have to!)
About REPUTATION...  I usually play as a good guy but this time around its harder to make money and I find myself drained of cash oftenly..  this forces me to steal, rob..  I had no other choice guys!  I'm truly really a good guy.. Im sorry but I really needed money and can't find any other way to get it fast! :-(

Dozens of Birds, Mammals, Fish to explore!!
Many types of personalities to meet.

GAME OF THE YEAR in my rating..

Thank You Rockstar and Fans who make this dream a reality!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_132?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=132&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Just passing the time til my next game.","October 31, 2019","RDR2 is such a disappointment--I kept thinking what they could've done with this title-- bank robberies, train robberies with ascending difficulties, gang shootouts, robbing other gangs, cruising on riverboats, dealing with indians (altho the pc crowd might've objected), so many many possibilities.
Here I've helped two women get home after their horses fell lame, helped a romeo and juliet couple send messages back and forth to eachother, killed a lot of people who didn't deserve to die.
And then there are the ambushes--periodically you'll be riding along and 6 or 7 thugs start shooting at you.  There's almost no way you can beat them.  They get some money from you and you wake up and its over and you can't ever go back and do it again--its gone.
And the dumb quests that are a setup: Go through the whole setup to raid a gang and get their money and the story line is right after you're done you'll be surrounded by law enforcement and probably die.  You can repeat it if you saved it, but the result will be the same because the storyline is that you must die.
Worst of all is the incessant riding, bouncing up and down for hours and hours.  No real fast travel.  Riding, riding, riding, riding.  Yes, I get it, there was a lot of boredom in the old west.  You can choose a viewpoint where the screen is bouncing up and down forever, or a viewpoint where you're always looking at a horse's rear end--whichever, but that WILL be the standard view for your whole game.
I can still give it a 3--good graphics, some good quests, an interesting storyline.  I passed the time for a while, but I was always thinking what game will I be playing next?","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_136?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=136&reviewerType=all_reviews"

F Harkin","Absolutely phenomenal investment of gaming time","November 21, 2018","I have been playing this game for weeks since its release and I am only on chapter 2.  If you are looking for continual twitch response gaming this is not for you.  This is a cinematic story you are at the heart of and a world within which you are immersed.

I am 48 years old and have been a gamer since my first Telstar system.  This game is simply incredible.  Last night I found myself simply fishing for half an hour on an picturesque river bend, tonight I plan on robbing a train.  Occasionally I will just sit by the fire with the gang while uncle plays the banjo and others tell stories.  Some members I love, others I can't stand, and I dread playing to the conclusion because it is clear they all are part of a dying breed in this world where their days are numbered.  For some we know the future based on RDR.  For others we do not and I worry about what is coming...  then I remember I am playing a game!

If you want to be immersed and entertained.  If you want to lose yourself in a richly developed world.  If you do not mind strolling slowly through that world and drinking deeply from every river and pool then this is the game for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_132?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=132&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Your enjoyment of this game will hinge on whether or not you are okay with some tedium and slower paced games. The payoff is a great story and a uniquely satisfying setting.

The Wild West may not be everyone’s thing in gaming, and there’s a reason it features in so few games. To accurately portray (in a gaming sense) the genre, you have to slow things down. This means traveling by horse takes longer than driving across GTA by car or flying by helicopter (shocker!).

The game adds in more bits like needing to eat, sleep, and bathe, that annoy some folks who just want to jump in and rob trains and blow things up. That’s their prerogative, but skipping this game for the tedious bits means you miss a beautifully set game with a solid story. Some of us even enjoy the more life-like aspects like hunting for food, stopping in at the general store, and greeting passers-by.

The spontaneous interactions are what make this game seem like the most realistic Western sim I’ve ever played. Random encounters galore here.

There are some major issues like the bandana (robbery mask) not working the way you’d think it does- just google it to see the complaints. Bumping people on your horse can start wild gun fights. Even finishing fights that other bandit gangs start with you can get you a bounty. So there are some annoying bits. No game is perfect though!

Overall the story and solid gameplay mechanics have been enough to keep me hooked and coming back for more. Sometimes you just want to ride your horse through the Wild West and bag a Buffalo before heading into the saloon for some poker. This game is great for lazy enjoyment with some thrills and fast paced action thrown in for fun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you need an animal skin, you study the animal, determine if the pelt is the right quality, and then kill it with a specific weapon - more like work.

Wow. Every aspect of that game was just oozing with detail, depth, and beauty. The world is a sight to behold. The amount of detail in everything from the animals to the foliage is just outstanding. Rockstar really put there heart and soul into it. Not to mention the absolutely incredible sound design. The sounds of horses trotting, birds whistling, leaves blowing in the wind, Elk shouts in the distance, npc’s conversing in the distance really ties everything in the world together to fully immerse you in this gorgeous world (a good headset really does it justice). The story is one of the most compelling in any game I have ever played. Arthur Morgan’s journey and character development will seriously keep you emotionally invested from start to finish. All the voice acting is second to none. Some of the best performances I’ve ever heard from the medium of gaming. Just to think the amount of hours the voice actors spent recording all these lines is mind blowing! Especially considering how incredible it is. The soundtrack.... oh my god the soundtrack. Without a doubt the best music I’ve ever heard in any video game. All the tracks are spectacular. From badass music that pumps you the hell up in a huge gunfight, to extremely emotional tracks that will really pull on ur heart strings and make ur arm hairs stand up. The way the tracks tie into the cutscenes and gameplay happening on screen is just so perfect.

With all that being said, this game is easily game of 2018, possibly even one of the best games EVER. Rockstar games poured their SOUL into this project and it showed. Without a doubt their best work to date.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_139?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=139&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But I knew ahead of time that I might not. I bought Red Dead 1 before 2 was available just to maybe see what all the hoopla was about. I found it incredibly boring. But 2 was getting such rave reviews I wanted to try it. Better than 1 by a good bit but after riding the horse a high percentage of the time and wondering where to go a good bit of the time with the occasional gun fight, where you kill good guys, I decided to move on. Now I have to say if you like wandering around and not a lot of action you will probably like this game. But I played Dark Souls 3 and others like it and loved them. Not boring at all. So my suggestion to you is to really think about what type of game play you like. If nice scenery and wandering around sounds good then Red Dead 2 is for you. If not wait a year or so and buy it cheap so you too can see what all the rave reviews are about.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_137?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=137&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The game is very boring, you spend most of the time riding your horse. The horse gets tired and you have to slow down. Controls are clunky.

That excitement was quickly diminished once I started playing the game. The graphics are average at best the gameplay is horrendous, and the story line is probably the most boring storyline of any game I've played.  Most game companies adopt what we have come to love as the Ubisoft way of open world games.  Rockstar completely ignored that.  Do not waste your money on this game. This is a $60 game that should cost 4.95 and that's even being generous. The game is clunky the movement is clunky the fast travel is the worst I've ever seen in a gameAnd you will spend most of your time falling off your horse for no reason whatsoever.

Update:  bumped this up to a 4 from a 3. It becomes easy to overlook the glitches because of the story and setting.

It was actually the reason I decided to buy a PlayStation. And needles to say, I eagerly awaited the arrival of this next installment. However, almost 10% into the game, and I still can not concentrate on the plot. Very, and I mean very, complicated controls, a very slowly evolving plot is just making it very difficult for me to get it going. The overall graphics level of the game is extraordinary (apart from human faces and facial expressions, which are disappointing), the world is vast (I guess, from what I have seen so far) but the enjoyability of the game is just below par so far.

Visually the game is stunning but is held back by frame rate dips(below 30fps). The pacing is God awful. The tutorials don't stop until the 10 hour mark, and up to that point the missions mostly revolve around tedious busy work rather than cool outlaw stuff. Time outside missions will mostly consist of horseback riding. The controls are clunky. Your character has 2 speeds, snail and light jog. I get that they wanted characters to move with a realistic weight to them but it ends up being more monotonous than immersive. Shooting has not changed at all from the first red dead. Lock on makes every combat encounter lack any semblance of challenge. And dead eye is still overpowered. Also the writers felt the need to insert modern day political stances in a game set in 1899. I won't get too much into it but basically ""white privelage"" is legit something that's talked about. Again the setting is 1899. It's immersion shattering when stuff like this is shoved in just to cater to political correctness. The themes are also the same as the first game except way more blunt. I'm talking dialog like ""our way of life is ending"" and other time wasting drivel. There is no subtly to anything. Everything has to be spelled out to cater to the widest audience possible. Also there's a morality meter, in a game where you are playing as an OUTLAW WHO MURDERS PEOPLE. Or in other words, this game is a boring slog of tedious activities. Not bad but certainly not the masterpiece critics make it out to be.

Edit: Those frame rate dips are cross platform baby. So if your like me and have a ps4 pro, you can curse into the air at Sony for selling a worthless product. I recommend the Xbox one x version as that has the best performance of the bunch.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Freeman","So much detail, so little time.","December 11, 2018","This is the first game I got with my PS4 Pro, and I hadn't had a PlayStation since PS2. I've been a Nintendo person, playing Wii sports (not Wii U, never got that one) or DS games like Animal Crossing, Phoenix Wright, Pokemon.

To be honest, I wanted the PS4 Pro and I didn't care that there was a Red Dead edition in celebration of RDR2 coming out; I just figured if this one comes with a game and is $400, and that one doesn't and is still $400, I should get the one with the ""free"" game. I'm so glad I did!

RDR2 has details etched into its details. Yes, you do have to spend a lot of real time to play a lot of game time, and you will have to do mundane things like pet/wash your horse, clean your guns, eat food and sleep. However, you will be struck by the beauty of the panoramic views while you're taking 5 minutes for a long horse ride across the map. The game beautifully shows starry nights, lightning storms, rainbows, and vast, picturesque views of mountains, hills, plains, desert, snow, forest, you name it!

Personally, I found it frustrating that there are about 10 buttons on the PS4 controller (including both triggers and pressing down on the analog sticks), yet there are about 1,639 commands for in-game play that require combinations of said buttons or reusing the button just in a different situation therefore it does something different. This was a huge learning curve for me, particularly while playing Overwatch wherein one button = one function.

A lot of people don't like how much toil there is in the game, with the horse cleaning and gun cleaning and self-care, but there is immense story to go along with all of that. There are lots of characters in the game, and no two playthroughs will have the same experience. You can play as an honorable outlaw, or kill everyone in sight, honor be damned. You can greet others or antagonize them; fight on the front line or send your team in to do the fighting for you. There are so many ""choose your own adventure"" lines of play that I think you could play and replay this game with only a framework of similarity.

Recently an online component was added, which can be frustrating to anyone who doesn't like being hogtied and killed within a few minutes of logging in. I think this will change in the future, but we'll see. Some people like that kind of thing, so if that's you, hop in! Just do me a favor and leave me and my character alone- I just want to ride my horse and hunt, and I have nothing of value for you. (I think this goes for a lot of players, FYI.)

However, you don't need to do online to enjoy this game. The standalone, 1 player experience itself will be very satisfying and enjoyable if the game premise appeals to you even a little bit. It is not only beautiful on screen, but the character acting and voiceover work is very well done. The story is pretty well thought out, and I believe you'll bond to the characters and really care about what happens to them as the game goes on.

I give it full stars for sucking me in when I was an unlikely fan. So many aspects of the game are appealing that I just couldn't resist it from the moment I got it installed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_134?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=134&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When i started playing the resolution of the game seemed too blurry and pixelated, it almost looked like a 720p game with some time-blur effect, my TV is an LG 4K OLED, a beautiful piece of technology, so i knew it was not the TVs fault, I started to investigate if there was a 4K patch or some configuration that would fix that crappy look, only to realize later in forums that this game is just an upscale and also to find out that the Xbox one X does manage to have 4K with RDR2 (I thought both platforms where very similar, my bad for not looking for that).

I would love that Rockstar had mentioned the upscale thing on the PS4 version previously, not after some fans/reviewers discovered it. I probably would have bought an Xbox one X with that info, but i would not even need to buy one if Rockstar released it on PC. Why does a big game creator with all the possibilities it has, limits in what platform you can play the game? Rockstar is playing the console manufacturer game and dragging all their marketing politics with them, you can overhype and sell all you want, but you are really selling your soul as a game creator when doing this, and people will realize that. I am trying to enjoy the game (and my console) but the truth is that i already feel scammed.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Cons: Feels like a re-skin of GTAV. Combat and controls are no different. Constantly mashing x to run or have your horse run gets really old. Lots of random button prompts.  Controls are clunky, I spend 5-10% if my time just wiggling in place, staring at the bottom right edge of the screen waiting for the right button prompt to pop up so I can perform an action.  Extremely slow paced. Controller is mapped to so many controls depending on what you're doing that I end up shooting people I'm trying to talk to. Horse has auto-follow-road, but ends up getting me killed or even a bounty on my head when it crashes into oncoming traffic.
Overall, this game had promise but to me it was just boring and clunky. I end up turning it off after only a little while to play something else.

The bad: This just wasn’t the game I was hoping for in red dead 2, it’s very VERY slow paced. You’ll spend a majority of your time riding your horse for real-time 10-20 minutes to do a 5 minute mission and then ride back that 10-20 minutes. The aiming system isn’t great. None of the guns are that special.

The good: this is why I give a 2 star instead of zero - the graphics are great and you can talk to / interact with everyone in the game.

Conclusion: I wouldn’t waste your time or money on this game - I bought it after seeing amazing reviews and was very let down. There are better options out there. I’m not sure why this got such great critic reviews - do they even play the games?","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

To much GTA DNA.","November 20, 2018","This game has been hyped to much for to long. I'm now 51% through the campaign with around 60 hours of playtime.
Gameplay: solid but not polished at all. Horseback controls are beyond bad. Your horse will run into things no horse would run into while your fighting/shooting. There is no way to slow your horse down and running into things will make you a wanted man.
Gunplay' Way to easy with no real upgrades making a difference. The first revolver does same as the (3rd) Schofield. I've killed alligators at distance with the varmint rifle(.22) and regular ammo.
Story and Honor system fallacy.
""My"" outlaw is a trying to be as good as possible. I only kill those trying to kill me and they shoot first. I stop and help every npc along the road knowing they may want to rob me. I donate to every homeless person I see. But when a cutscene happens and I need to collect a debt from a family whose matriarch has died my absolute jerk character can't give a crap. Even though I had over 4500 bucks on me I'm not even given the option to pay the debt which I would've.
Law: this is the clincher. This is where the GTA DNA really ""shines""..... So running? Don't hit a lawman. They will swarm and kill you like you assaulted them with an auto rifle. There is no way to surrender. Even a $15 bounty is a death sentence. Sure you can fight and escape but all you do is add to your bounty with every single kill. It's quite ridiculous. Skyrim is old as time and their guards even gave you the option to pay your bounty and go on with the game. Unreal.
Fast Travel: AT some point in the game you will unlock fast travel FROM your base camp. That's it though. When you need to get TO your base you'll be galloping every time. This is insane. Sure exploring is fun. For a while then it's time to get the story moving.

If you play video games casually  or haven't really played much over the last few years buy this game! If you think it's not really your type of game because you aren't into the old west or cowboys I still say buy this game!  The amount of work Rockstar has put into this game over the long development cycle is absolutely incredible and I truly hope to spend hundreds of hours playing in this world. I would argue that any one even remotely interested in this game should give it a try because most people will be enthralled with every second of gameplay.  Red Dead makes you want to interact with every character in the world and each interaction helps to shape your characters personality.  The graphics on this game are amazing and Rockstar really seems to be getting all it can out of the PS4 Pro and the XBOX One X.
 I am also hoping they consider a mode to
Incorporate the PSVR at some point in the future which could be incredible.  This game should take you a long time to finish because it's hard not to explore everywhere and do any little side quest. The voice acting is great and the way the world reacts to you or your previous actions is great.  This game is difficult to even walk away from and is the best looking game ever put on the PS4 pro over the amazing God of War in my opinion.

This is true but only halfway. This game is targeted specifically for original Red Dead fans. However, Rockstar did not alienate newcomers by bringing in a new protagonist, Arthur Morgan. Their are two major reasons why this game starts slow. One is because it's a huge game and it's trying to teach you that its not always time for guns blazing action. And two is to enhance the realism of the world you're playing in. This entry is trying to get players to stop and see the sights, not gun down every npc you come acrossed or always expect loot for your effort.
Basically, if you don't want to play a western civilization simulator, don't buy this game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It is a beautiful game, and beautifully crafted, but the game itself is pretty dull. The story isn't amazing. You travel about as often as you actually play the game. Generally mindless, boring travel, with not much else. I mean, this would be great for a roleplaying experience in a multiplayer setting, but that isn't what this is. Also, the actual gameplay, such as gunplay, is just bad. Same outdated controls as the rest of the Rockstar games. The characters aren't as interesting as the first in the series, and the main character, while very realistic, and well written, is boring, and dull. I cared nothing about anyone in the entire game, and I found myself playing as long as I did, not because I liked the game, but because I was forcing myself, and waiting for it to get better. It never did. Nothing happens in the story outside of the prologue, for about half of the game, other than moving camps three or so times.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_128?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=128&reviewerType=all_reviews"

And by ""design,"" I mean everything when it comes to controls, HUD, interface, game logistics/features, and even the experience of saving the game!  I was able to adjust my play style to make it work with this game and ensure I'd still enjoy it, but here are the issues I have with the design (bear in my mind, I'm reviewing the PS4 version):

1. The Controls.  The controls are nonintuitive and clunky.  It almost seems like the designers said ""OK, this is what most games use for button assignment and are, likewise, what most gamers are used to.  Let's completely shuffle that and screw that up for everyone.""  It makes no sense to me that I have to press the X button to sprint/run, but I have to press the SQUARE button to climb up obstacles.  The buttons to interact with different items change; picking up a weapon off the floor requires pressing R1, yet picking up a hat on the floor requires pressing SQUARE.  Why?  I have no clue.

2. The Gameplay.  The controls also contribute to making the gameplay more boring when it could definitely be more engaging.  Hand to hand combat is button-mashing CIRCLE until you can land the right punch that knocks your opponent out.  The aiming system seems to be quick but makes it difficult to engage moving targets.  The gameplay elements are given ambiguous and vague details and instructions when guiding players, making it difficult to understand how to simply do a quick draw or know what a ""Fence"" actually does.  All of the guidance tips are tucked at the top left corner of the screen in small text, and show up for a limited time, making it tough to comprehend how to use the gameplay elements at their fullest potential.  Even items and clothes at merchants don't have pictures or previews to know what they look like before purchasing them (at least from my experience when purchasing masks from a fence).

There are scenes in the game that have inevitable outcomes, yet don't become a cut scene.  For example, at the end of one of the side missions (not plot relevant), the target ends up shooting himself.  The game has suggested that you're able to prevent this from happening, either by shooting his gun away or perhaps by using a lasso.  However, trying all of these will not work and it seems like the outcome is meant to be inevitable.  For a game that seems to rely on a morality system and a medal system on missions, this is very frustrating for players who want to lean towards a particular side of the moral compass or get gold on missions.

Also, the missions!  You are awarded gold, silver, or bronze medals upon completion of a mission, depending on how well you performed based on a checklist of standards (finish within 2 minutes, get 12 headshots, etc.).  However, they don't show the checklist to the player until AFTER the mission is done!  Almost every other game featuring a ""completion award system"" that I've played always has a checklist given before or during the mission, never after.  It's incredibly frustrating for players who want to achieve perfection to play a mission, only to see that they got a silver or a bronze because they missed one requirement for gold that they didn't even know about until after they completed the mission.  Who actually thought that was a good idea?  It doesn't promote replayability, it promotes frustration and discouragement.

3. Saving the game.  You can only save between missions and can never save mid-mission.  This seems like it was a terrible design flaw where the game can't pinpoint your exact location on a map and doesn't bother with saving your progress within a mission.  Even when I'm able to manually save the game (which is when I'm not in the middle of a mission), loading that save takes me to a point on the map that's in the general vicinity of where I had saved the game.  This is very frustrating for someone who may have a play style that prefers not to commit to a full mission in one sitting.

With all this said, I decided I still was going to play this game and overlook these issues.  It's still playable, and I'm actually enjoying myself when it comes to traveling and completing missions.  The story is engaging, the acting is great, the graphics are great, and I'm ultimately living out a cowboy fantasy.  There are highly realistic aspects of the game to help simulate life in the Wild West, such as when it comes to spending money, having bounties on your character, and facing consequences with every little action.

However, this game is not nearly perfect because of the issues I listed above; they greatly diminish the playing experience and make what could have been a great game into a poorly-designed mess.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_130?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=130&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But where it seriously lacks is one of the most imortant things: gameplay.  If youve ever played grand theft auto, just imagine that but set in the 19th century.  It really took some getting used to, like probably 10+ hours of playing, what kept me playing was the story.  The story is emotional and captivating, and it just keeps you sucked in, no matter how hard arthur is to control.  If it werent for the story, I would have sold the game thr same day I bought it.  The story takes a bit to pick up, but it gets really good.  If this were a tv show, I would watch the crap out of it.

Saving a game is tricky, you can only do it when nothing is happening - weird again. The sequel is a big letdown after the great game story and options. I only bothered because of some bad guys who weren't killed in main story... Another odd thing is if you want to do certain actions, like get GOLD - you must use Google and find out how. There is no way you could know it even existed, much less find it, without Google.

As others have said, great game to look at - most times - but really slow and boring.

But I want to review this game from a different angle.

The release of RDR2 was much anticipated for many of my friends and people we knew in clans (in the original RDR).  So I want to do a bit of a comparison review.

What made the original RDR great in my opinion wasn't the storyline, but multiplayer.  Many people got addicted to shootouts, bag matches, stronghold, coop, etc.  That was the driving force of RDR.  That's evidenced by all the clans that were created.  People wanting to be the most recognized, the best player, and climb the leaderboards.

By comparison, RDR2 did not incorporate clans in any form.  They have free roam posse's with a max of 4 or 7 people.  That's basically so friends have a place to setup camp or so small groups can do things together.  RDR2 also has a honor system, so if you're going to wreak havoc, then you will lose honor.  At this point (12-12-18) the honor system doesn't really mean much.  Some have said it will matter eventually.  Point being, RDR2 is not conducive to clans or even going around and killing people.

They have these competitive series, which is apparently the equivalent of the original game where you could do multiplayer shootouts and such.  In this version you typically use throwing knives or bow/arrow and creep through the woods, and the reaction time of using those weapons is slow.  In other matches, you get more weapons, but again, the accuracy is not great, the speed is slow, methodical, and there's a lot of inaccuracies.  For example, when I use a varmint rifle in free roam, the range is not far, I can barely kill some birds, yet in multiplayer, I'm constantly getting killed by varmint rifles.  When I use a Lancaster, the accuracy isn't as good, so if I take 2-4 shots to kill a guy, he'll turn and shoot me with his varmint.  So I should use and trust the varmint, but it's basically a BB gun and mostly used for --- killing varmint's.  The fact that it's the weapon of choice in multiplayer is an utter joke.

The game really feels a lot more like GTA V than it does RDR, and that's a huge mistake.  Friends who loved the original RDR seem to hate RDR2, because Rockstar has overhauled what made RDR great.  A lot of my clan buddies are calling RDR2 boring and I've seen others playing other games now, and RDR2 is still in its Beta stage.

Essentially, Rockstar has turned RDR2 into a hunting, fishing, and e-commerce game.  You need to earn XP to level up, you have to earn cash to buy weapons, and they're encouraging you to use real money to buy gold so that you can buy virtual stuff in their game, or to get your guns gold.  It's not like the old game where you earn your keep.  Now you buy your keep.

Gone is stronghold, the traditional coop, bag matches, but also gone is prestige and earning mounts (remember the buffalo and zebra?).

I'm telling you, after you get past the graphics and earning a few weapons and better ammo, the euphoria of this game - if there ever was any - wears off.  Last night after doing a mission with my friend we were like, now what.  My friend said he was bored and he's just gonna go.  In the old days, we'd be going to casual games, shootouts, bag matches, something.  Now it's just whatever.

One other thing that makes this game boring is you have to ride everywhere.  And you have to pay to fast travel, so that's discouraged.  Plus, as you're hunting to earn cash, you have to continually watch your character skin every animal.  In the old game you could at least speed it up by standing your horse over the carcass... not anymore.

While people think the map is huge, they have removed the whole southern hemisphere, so there is no El Presidio, Nosalida or any of that.

If you enjoy doing stranger missions, hunting, fishing, and playing multiplayer games in the forest that have the functionality of GTA V, then you may really like this, but my RDR friends are not liking this new version.

The updates Rockstar has provided are for ecommerce and bugs; they're not helping gameplay.  I seriously doubt gameplay is going to improve.  I don't know how it can.  I am doubtful that there's going to be stronghold incorporated and if it is, it'll be so different than the last game that the stronghold loyalists won't care.  It's really disappointing.  It's as if GTA V is rockstar's baby and they decided to make RDR2 a spinoff of that instead of making it more like the original.

BIG NEGATIVE.  If you have been hunting a couple hours, you wander off to pickup some pelts, kill a couple more things, wander a little further, then realize, oh, my horse is out of sight, whistle and when your horse catches up, all your stuff will be gone... you let your horse get too far away and all that work is for not.  Further, if you die, or are killed, the pelts, carcasses, and other things on your horse will either be gone or maybe stolen.

PERSISTENT CAMP NEGATIVES:

1) When you save up to create a persistent camp and choose a location for it, you'll be lucky if your camp is ever in that same location again.  Yet it costs money to move your camp.

2) They hold a max of 7 people, so again, not conducive to clans.

3) If you think you're safe because your white flag is raised, I still got hogtied and dragged away.  All the stuff on my horse was knocked off.  I wonder if I hadn't come back to my game and seen myself being dragged away if I wouldn't have lost everything on my horse.

BIG NEGATIVE:  There are no privates sessions, no private free roam, no private games, and really not much like the old game at all.

BIG NEGATIVE:  While playing, if you get a phone call or have to take a crap, you better be at your camp and open up the box where ammo you purchase goes to, because otherwise it'll time out.  I've tried a rubber band on my controller, but twice my horse has ran into a building and stopped moving its feet and I timed out.  You can't even just sit at your camp.  You'll get a message that you have 13 minutes until the game times out.

NEGATIVE:  There are only a few butchers on the whole map so relating to the issue above, you're going to a butcher across the map, get a phone call, your game becomes inactive, you're booted.

I now hope when the game boots up that my camp will be somewhat close to a butcher and I won't go to a butcher when other people are in the game b/c they'll kill you and take your stuff.  You'll still have things in your satchel, feathers and stuff, but the bigger stuff will be gone.  So I stay active, use my camp as a safety haven, and I go to the butcher when nobody's around.  then go back to my camp, and I hunt and gather close to my camp.

Along with no private free roams, there's no ""friendly"" ones either.

Rockstar went the extra yard to be as realistic as they can.  IMO, they spent far too much time on that, when they should have focused more on what made RDR great.  RDR remained popular for years because of multiplayer games.  Everyone who was anyone wanted to get 50 kills in shootouts.  Now nobody cares.  Rockstar didn't ask the RDR community what they wanted in a sequel, and now I think they're going to lose a huge chunk of their audience.

Last thing I'll say is about the graphics.  I think anymore these days, everyone expects great graphics, so that really shouldn't be a selling point for RDR2.  The game looks great, but they didn't exceed my expectations.  If anything, the game was pumped up so much and I saw so much in previews and videos that I was disappointed by what I played.  Nothing really knocked my socks off.  I've seen just as good or better graphics in far cry, event horizon and other games.  And the game play (and getting around) in event horizon is far superior to RDR2.  There should be more to a Game of the Year nominee than graphics and storymode.  Because honestly, the storymode aspect of a game is only eye candy.  People loved multiplayer in RDR.  That should be the selling point for RDR2, but it's definitely not.  For that reason, I don't think people will be as into RDR2 as they were RDR, at least for not as long.  RDR would still be somewhat popular if the game weren't hacked.  A lot of people I've spoken with now wish that RDR were remastered.  All the GTA lovers can have RDR2, we just want to get back to the game we loved.  Unfortunately it's gone.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_130?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=130&reviewerType=all_reviews"

From someone who has never played the first game, it is definitely not as fun as Grand Theft Auto or even Bully. The open world is not very engaging, but given that it is largely comprised of wildlife, idk what I expected honestly. Gameplay seems good for the most part, but the on-foot controls definitely could've used some tuning. Given that it is a Rockstar game you should expect the standard travel from A to B type missions, but the characters and story make them worthwhile. If you're into that Wild West setting and a long, interactive movie, then by all means give this game a chance.  It's definitely not the worst thing in the world as some other reviews might suggest, but I would wait for the game to go on sale before purchasing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

NO 🧢","October 27, 2018","Anyone that gives this game anything less than 5stars is looking for attention or trying to get someone to not buy the game for some sick twisted reason. The game is two disc because of all the lovely content and details it has so you’ll need about an hour to download all disc data to your console before playing. The game starts off in the snowy mountains and flows through missions of the first chapter without allowing you to roam free so be patient however you’ll arrive New hanover area where you can interact with your camp and do so many things besides missions. The game has taken realism to a whole another level, if you’ve just shaved your beard clean forget about putting it back like your typical video game but it will grow back in time. You also can buy horses and name them and groom them etc. Hunting is another level compared to GTA V, you can hunt any animal you see , skin it and put it on your hourse to sell or cook etc. There are bar brawls, bounty hunting, dominoes , barbershop visits...oh and did I mention you can gain weight like CJ in GTA san andreas. I’m still playing this game but this is definitely a must have game. After playing GTA V numerous times i must say that I’m enjoying RDR2 and my wife agrees too. The details are just amazing and too numerous to mention. You can interact with others around and have meaningful conversation outside of random lines of conversation in previous GTA games. There is a mission where all you literally do is get drunk and there is also being able to loot and search someone’s pockets after killing them. Rockstar did a TREMENDOUS JOB! I won’t be playing any other game for awhile and that’s including NBA 2k19! I’m gonna go back to play now....so all I’ll say is “HURRY UP AND BUY”!!!! 🤑💪🏽 (PSN : jrnorton8)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Hours of trailing people on horses listening to them yap about god-knows-what, and in the moments in-between, scintillating activities like: eating food, sleeping, sharing food, trying to mount your horse, walking around like you're waist-deep in molasses, and sleeping some more.

If this game were set in modern times, a mission might go something like this: press triangle to get in your car. Follow Frank to the grocery store. Listen to Frank gossip about Loretta and John. Press triangle to remove food from the shelf. Press square to add food to grocery cart. Decide whether Frank is lying about Loretta. Press square to move can over self-checkout scanner. Press triangle to bag. Press square to take receipt. Press triangle to get in your car. Follow Frank back to apartment. Listen to Frank gossip about John's brother, Jimmy. Press square to sleep.

Sure, there's cinematic mode, but you still have to hold/tap X to keep your horse going. And the majority of the game is just that. It's bad when I enter a party chat while riding my horse and my friend goes ""playing Red Dead? I can hear you tapping x constantly."" Fast travel is possible, but still requires you to get to the fast travel points, rather than just opening your map and choosing a destination. The random encounters start to repeat themselves over and over again, so those get boring pretty fast. Most action from random hostiles was in the Murfree Brood section, but dead eye ends those interactions within seconds. The map is beautiful. Lots of animals to kill, but that just becomes a grind after awhile when going for perfect pelts or looking for little birds. The random stranger encounters repeat themselves rather quickly, so not a lot of variety there. Side quests aren't bad and provide some interesting little stories. Some become a grind though when it involves collecting certain things. Only reason this game gets 3 stars is because the story is alright, I enjoyed some of the side quests, and it's a beautiful map with great graphics. Gameplay though is lacking a ton, with no hope of improvement or future content, since they will only focus on their online mode and selling in game currency for a ridiculous amount of $.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_131?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=131&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Zelda Breath of the Wild was so amazing right out of the gates, that maybe I'm tainted because the hand holding in the Red Dead 2 open world that takes hours and hours, is an honest snooze fest.

If you spend 50 hours in this game, you will spend 39 hours of it riding a horse from place to place. 1 hour spent shooting. The final 10 hours on cut scenes. It's slow paced. The art work and design of things is beautiful. The world this game inhabits is incredible for it's detail. The game play (shooting, and walking around) is ""ok"". Other games have better shooting and movement. The avatar you play in this game is quite stiff and walks slowly.
In direct contrast to games with a faster pace (Far Cry 5, Witcher 3, almost any other game) this is a very slow game. And as far as ""fun"" factor, this slowness makes the game much less fun than other games currently available.
I finished the game and enjoyed the story. But won't replay this one. There were some very fun missions in the game. Train robberies, bank robberies and so on. But it takes a long time to get to them.
Not a bad game. Just not as much fun as you might be hoping for. Since I have limited time, spending so much of this game getting to the ""good stuff"" was a detraction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_136?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=136&reviewerType=all_reviews"

((((((((SPOILERS)))))))))))
(((((((((AHEAD))))))))))))))

  Things to do... (thus far) this is the most impressively built game I’ve ever played. The voice acting vocals and music are 💯💯 Well we’re do I begin, you start running away from the police because, as it seems an unknown crime that you, and crew committed, were running to safety, before the game started. Then you notice you’re walking around in 10-12 inches of snow and realize this is the most advanced snow physics up to date, then you jump on your horse for the first time east enough right? No, now it’s gonna tell you that you have to take care of the horse, heal it, feed it, try your best to not kill it. A few missions in i was hooked, actually thought about calling into work, because it impressed me so
Much, you can kill, rob peoples and stores, kidnap, hold people for ransom, fight against the members of the KKK, (Oh Sweet Justice).
  Then you have your guns, gun graphics, addons, special ammo, and dynamite just  Incase you get into a sticky fight,
  One of its greatest feats would be the addition of health, energy and dead eye, also same for your horse.
  The first things I did when I finally downloaded the 92gb ffs on my pro is explore, and IT IS MASSIVE. Always someone asking for help or trying to set you up, I found myself just galloping around for hours and checking out the layout before I hit the SALON: Of course you could just get drunk😪 or you can play a multitude of different types of games, Texas Holdem poker, the “try to cut your fingers off game” blackjack, and so much more. And as always you can take everyone’s Poker chips then kill them all or do it your way.
  That would be my review or this amazingly gorgeous game, can be slow, but I’m this fast paced world how much are we missing because we want “faster”? This is a game that you can play how you wanna play, “KILLEM ALL” or be a gentle cowboy that’s doing his best to survive and keep surving.
  I absolutely cannot wait for the online and single player add ons, Rock ⭐️ Is a fantastic company that doesn’t bicker with other companies, they put what they got on the table and keep doin better and Better. I’m so glad there is finally a company that puts out quality work, not slapping out (re-skinned) games evey year ..... COD🤬🤬🤮
  I’ve honestly played >10 hours and still have yet to find all there is to find, if anything changes I’ll be back to change my review but I’m gonna give this Goregeous game a 10.1/10, simply for the detail alone. Every tree sways in the wind, dynamic movements, great way to spend time on the poker tables, or helping strangers, robbing stage coaches/ trains, and just creating general mayhem if that’s your choice. P.S. You’re choices on the decisions you make will change the game drastically, E.G. rob a salon, next time you go
I’m they instant tell you not to cause anymore trouble and are on more alert.
  Give it a shot, it’s game of the decade at least, and I would put it above gta 5, sorry:/. Hope you all enjoyed, thanks!

Well it has been over a month and my original review was not harsh enough. The game has had no updates and the server problems, griefing, and overall game play is impossible to tolerate for more than the twenty minutes a week I start it to see if it has become worse. It has,

Lets see. Beta must mean, beta for at least three more months according to rockstar tweets. constant disconnects due to rockstar server error. constant griefing, no passive. constant glitches, same error seven different times no reply.

Sloppy controls, frequent server crashes, the tutorial tells you how to play only AFTER you've gotten stuck in a nasty situation, and unless you're playing in a group (online), you will accomplish absolutely nothing.  Here's a list of other problems I encountered, while online:

-Eagle Eye will not always expose every danger in your field of view, thus putting you in dangerous situations despite the caution you've taken.

-The game's economy is severely imbalanced.  ""Want your guns upgraded?  Cool...that'll be three hundred dollars.  You have pelts to sell?  Cool...I'll give you three dollars.""

-Your position on the map will always be marked for other players, making it impossible for you to hide or escape when you're hopelessly outnumbered.

-Other players can easily take over a town, shoot you dead when they see you coming to visit a store, and suffer no consequence.  Knock an old lady over by mistake, however, and the law is on you.  Either way, this makes it impossible to profit from business with NPC's.

-Animals and NPC's will suddenly appear in front of you, when you're riding at a high speed.  This will result in your horse tossing you off, and trampling you to your death.

-If you get killed...regardless of how...any horse cargo you've acquired will be lost.

I tried the Story mode, and I just can't get into it.  I'm so frustrated with everything else that I just don't care, and it's not the game is trying to win me over, because there are other games out there, with more exciting tasks than 'pick up that cup', 'walk into the barber shop', 'talk to that guy', etc.

I put maybe five hours into it before deleting it off of my PS4.  One can easily read my comments and assume that I hated this game, but it's hard to admit to that, especially after the profound love I had for the original Red Dead Redemption.  I REALLY wanted to love this game, and I'm angered over the fact that I cannot.

PS I changed my rating to one star.  To be fair, it deserves no more than two-and-a-half, but the overall rating for this game is incredibly skewed by mindless bias, and players who aren't being compensated by Rockstar Games should be compelled to offset it, with the publishing of one-star ratings.

UPDATE 2/15/19: I gave the game another shot, and every time I think I can find a way to enjoy it, I'm punished.  I just shot down a highway robber that killed a couple on a stagecoach, and witnesses reported me to the authorities.  Even when you try to do 'the right thing', the game punishes you.

I had to have edited this review a half a dozen times...I hated the game THAT MUCH.

Enough is enough...I sold this overrated piece of garbage to Gamestop.

I've been playing video games for 37 years...this is the first game I ever sold.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_124?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=124&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Carr","The world is visually appealing, but the game itself isn't fun","November 2, 2018","I'm finding myself bored to tears with it after 17 hours.  There are tons of things to do from various missions given to you by people you meet, but so far they've all been boring so I'm not inclined to take on many activities outside the main story line.

As others have said, the constant horseback riding is tedious.  Even train, stagecoach, and the very limited camp fast travel are tedious.  Do we really need unskippable cut scenes to travel in ways other than horseback?  Just put us at our destination so we can continue with the game at a faster pace.  The cinematic camera mode + X while horseback riding is convenient, but we still have to sit there staring at it until the horse gets to the destination, hope the horse doesn't run into any bandits, and stop  when it start bucking because it needs to be calmed and fed.  Travel is my biggest complaint in the game.  All means of travel are frustrating in their own way.

As far as the controls, you can accidentally punch someone while trying to mount your horse and get a warrant. You have to be extremely careful when to press which buttons on the controller.  I recommend manual saving often because of issues like this so you can reload your game and try again.  I reload probably 3 or 4 times an hour because of this.

Constantly having to replenish your health/stamina cores and that of your horse makes the pace even slower.  I don't care if you have to eat and sleep in real life.  This isn't real life.  I also have to take a dump IRL and I'm glad they at least left that out.

Overall I'm not sure if I'll be finishing the game.  I'll give it a few more hours and if no change in enjoyment it'll be time to sell.  This feels like a case of the developers trying too hard.  Too bad they tried too hard in some areas no one cares about. Too much pointless filler and fluff. I'm baffled by all the perfect scores it received.  Maybe if you're someone who enjoys spending lots of time doing menial chores at a snail's pace this will be a 10/10.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_131?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=131&reviewerType=all_reviews"

TEDIOUS. ClUNKY. SLOW. AVOID.","November 22, 2018","The good. GRAPHICS? Seems like now days thats what makes a good game.
Rockstar is great at adding the realism to their games. But thats their downfall. Its so real its boring. And ironically, the only thing not real is how the cops magically find you in the middle of nowhere. They are relentlessly unrelastic. Go figure? If you defend yourself againts a person you verbally antagonize, that starts to shoot you, the cops Are after you! If you do crimes with a mask on, they still know its you! And Arthur walks like he has butt herpeez. Its like they purposely slow you down to a crawl walk so you can immerse in every piece of scenery. Let me run if I want to dammit! You do chores. Yes. Chores, that will take you about 15 mins to do. I do chores in real life and I despise them. Why would add that to my game? And speaking of game, this is not a game. Its a simulator. ITS THE SIMS., with guns and horsies. Everything is clunky about that game, to riding the horse, shoot outs and fighting. The story is ok, I guess, because this game is a prequel, so we all know what technically happens. If you enjoy playing this snooze fest, you are an idiot with ADHD. I want my money back for this sleeping pill of a game. I am forcing myself to complete the story just so I wont feel like I totallt wasted my money. ROCKSTAR CAN KISS MY POOP SHOOTER.

That's about it.","December 16, 2018","I wanted this to be a five star game. I really did. I've been waiting 8 years for another Red Dead, because Red Dead Redemption 1 is one of my favorite games... though, sadly, this is not one. The review that follows contains spoilers. They are criticisms I noted during my time playing this game.

 Hypersensitive trigger happy lawmen. One crime observed = 1 second for a hornets nest of 20 lawmen to appear. And it's not fun.

Civilization with a 6th sense for crime

The epilogue felt more like the beginning of the game than Chapter 1; and it felt like the beginning of a better game than the the main storyline.

300 different weapons? Really? Where exactly are they? Each store sells basically the same ones. Same foods and provisions. Same items to steal. The variety is LACKING.

Nudity is infrequent.

Having a hunting dog as a companion would have been nice. Having anyone or anything as a companion would have been fun too

The hunting the was the best part of the gameplay, which isn't something I'm all that thrilled about (RDR1 ate a wildlife hunting game and Little House on the Prairie.)

Another pretty game that has sacrificed gameplay to graphics. Think Assassins Creed.

Do you enjoy riding on horseback for hours taking to NPCs?

The excitement of helping to build a house: hit X at the right time... ZZZZZ

Lost the quirkiness of the original (the grave digger, the snake oil salesman.) Any razy surprises in the little books and crannies? Nope.

If you're looking for something, no worries. You don't have to look hard. The map highlights it for you. Eagle eye also highlights everything you can take... which doesn't require much guessing, considering most things you can take are tonic bottles.

Like to choose your weapons? Not for many scenes. You're thrown into battle with a repeater...

Enjoy going straight into battle? Not before you follow instructions such as ""get into cover."" Then move with Sadie, then ""kill the sniper.""

The snipers scope moves at a snails pace when you are moving it while looking through it.

I got to go on a hot air balloon ride. One ride. Never to be repeated.

The clothes are boring. Nothing scandalous or outrageous.

Out of the hundreds of doors in this game, you're lucky to find a few that you can pass through. Especially in the cities, and entering a cottages is few and far between.

Fully upgraded satchel does not allow you to carry a great number of pocket watches... So frequent trips to the fence are still required in order to make more moneys

Mor wilderness than things to do in it, especially after the Blackwater region opens.

In conclusion: I still love the game, even with all it's shortcomings. But Fall Out 4 and Skyrim are still the best game ever made. If they had RD2's graphics, they would be unbeatable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_130?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=130&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Average at best","November 4, 2018","At around 30 or so hours, I am done with this game. Boring and tedious is the best way to describe it. Rockstar forces you to perform tedious chores like chopping wood, cleaning your horse, and the worst of all, maintaining your cores. Controls are clunky and garbage as you would expect for a Rockstar game, it doesn't take a mouse & keyboard or high FPS for a game to feel fluid. Expect to use auto aim or pay the price. Game really drags itself out to make it longer and is overall very slow paced. This game has flashes of excellence, but is is over shadowed by this ultra realism that just doesn't make sense in a VIDEO GAME, something I know Rockstar and gamers have forgotten.

Part of it is that the game opens in a blizzard and I simply hated that environment.  I was going to give up on the game at that point, but decided to keep playing, despite the very harsh opening, in the hopes that it would improve.  I also needed to get to know the characters.  I was annoyed by them until I got to know them.  I was also very irritated at the controls for the first few hours and the lack of fast travel.  I kept playing because I grew up riding horses and I loved how real the horses were in this game.

I slowly got to know the characters and began to enjoy the environments (outside of the snowy region).  I loved discovering new towns and the various characters I encountered.  I liked a few of my fellow gang members.  I liked Arthur.  I found myself feeling sorry for him when I would make him do something really stupid just to see what would happen.

This game can be frustrating because you know that some of the actions in the main story line are going to only make things worse.  Arthur knows that are going to make things worse, but goes along with it.  It's a weird game dynamic.  In most games, you are trying to make things better.  In this way, the game plays more like a movie than a game.  Characters have depth and make imperfect decisions.  In a way, I felt trapped by the main missions.  I didn't want to put Arthur in danger and I wanted him to make different decisions.

The main missions contrast with the rest of the world.  In the open world, you can make decisions and treat people well or poorly.  You can observe wild animals and just enjoy seeing them or you can hunt them.  You can help various strangers or ignore them.  While the main missions are linear, you can explore the world at your leisure.

There are tons of Easter eggs to discover and I spent hours searching for many of them.  At first, I was annoyed a the limited fast travel options, but I came to enjoy riding around the environment and studying new animals and plants, while encountering strangers.

There are a few parts of this game that really annoyed me.  I am a woman and I didn't want to grow a beard, so I spent many hours returning to camp or going to barbers to shave.  I also disliked bathing, but if you stop bathing, people comment that you smell awful.  Eating was the other thing that annoyed me, but I eventually just stopped eating and dealt with having low health.  There are just too few food options in this game.  I don't enjoy stew or big game meat in real life and I don't want to ""eat"" those things in the game either.

I recommend this game.  It requires a big time commitment though.  It took me 100+ hours to finish this game over the course of several months.  I would definitely play it again once I start to forget the story more.  I usually trade games in after finishing them, but this one is a keeper.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Al Hammadi","I would buy it again","February 22, 2019","The game starts slow, but once it puts everything into gears it goes ahead in style, it introduced gameplay and side quests that can be found in the open world in a beautiful tutorial which then lets you go ahead by yourself. After maybe two hours playing you will get the hang of all the games available in the open world, from character side missions, to hunting legendary animals, to small poker games, dominos andf inger fillet.

The game will has so many things to be done, explored and played. As other games where you will have to find your way through boring areas till you get to the next main mission or side mission in the world, in RDR2 you will find you self stolen by other side quests and the normal path that sounds tedious and boring turns out to be filled with events, side quests and other small activities scattered in this world that seems more alive than even a real world itself.

I never did experience a dull moment in RDR2, i was always engaged even in areas where i though i am safe to do my borning stuff like camping, i saw myself raided by a bandit in the world and threatened to move to another area or face the consquences of not adhering to their warning.

The story is also one of the strong areas of the game, I do not wanna go into any details of the story but Rockstar has really came up with a beautiful story for RDR2 and it really showed the climax in the ending of the game. The story should not be missed, and I can safely say that it has nothing repetitive in the story in terms of gameplay, I found myself in areas where i though a gun fire will insue as usual just to be surprised by the events that has unfold and I was left to come up with a different approach than what I had planned, and obviosuly stacked and cleaned my weapons for.

Finally I would highlight the graphics and textures in the game, the game contains a vast areas filled with animals, birds, crawling animals, and vegetation, I found myself wondering how could the PS4 handle such a load of details in the game without crashing. This shows how much effory Rockstar put in optimizing the game for the console. I think this kind of details would likely require a high end pc to run. This if it says anything, it indicate the beautiful world that was created and the amazing game RDR2 is.

I highly recommend this game for everyone with a console. I loved it so much that I am willing to buy it again on PC if it was released (I wanna play it again in FPS using mouse and keyboard).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The realism and details in Red dead redemption 2 are truly next gen, it actually feels like most characters feel alive and genuine, especially with the voice acting. People often complain about clunky controls but honestly I loved the controls, never felt stiff or clunky.

Ridiculous.

Second, people are complaining that it takes ""forever"" to travel because you have to ride horses everywhere. This is just untrue. There are not one, not two, but THREE fast travel options. A map that you can unlock pretty early on, stagecoaches, and trains. But having said that I personally recommend that you ride whenever possible or you will miss a lot of chance-encounter missions, gorgeous environment, and tons of easter eggs.

For me the action and fighting was fine, nothing mind-blowing, it was the beauty and storytelling that make this game special. There are no crazy weapons or insane combos, it's not God of War, but I've never felt so invested in the characters and story of a video game before. The plot itself was fairly straightforward but the voice acting was great and unlike most video game stories you actually see the characters evolve and change from beginning to end. I don't know what else I can compare it to except maybe Last of Us - but honestly I found Last of Us kind of boring, for me this was meatier and there are a bunch of side missions that all have their own multi-part arcs.

I've finished RDR2 now and have moved on to another game, but I think when I'm finished with it I'm going to go back and play RDR2 again. Maybe try being ""bad"" this time. I don't know, either way I miss the richness of that world and I'm looking forward to giving it another play through.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_129?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=129&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sadly very little of that experience is apparent in RDR2.
For a mere cowboy, be prepared to navigate thru a ridiculous amount of controls for very little gain. They're unnecessarily complicated with few quick switching options. Having to press 2 buttons to reach the map proved to be a pain and worse yet the weapons wheel did whatever it wants especially when on horseback. Good luck to you if you're in dire circumstances n in need of the weapon of your choice.
Not going on & on here but it must be sed this game is boring and a shadow of its predecessor. Seriously if you loved RDR just keep it and skip this game. You'll only come away upset & out $60.

Roemer","Fun, but if depends on your style of gaming","January 2, 2019","Let me start by stating that I am not done with the game yet, and I'm glad not to be.
I'm a little shocked by the negative reviews, but I understand some of the comments.  The game is gorgeous, especially the environments and scenery.  The map is very large and can take a while to navigate, but there are options.  The animations of the characters seem a little unsophisticated at this point in gaming graphics.
I haven't played GTA in a long time, and I only recently (in the last year) played Red Dead Redemption.  I feel like the characters and horses behave and look very similar to RDR, but up close there are enhancements.  I felt like getting around in RDR, once the game really opened up, was much worse than RDR2.  I honestly am not even sure where I'm at in the main story line.  I happily get distracted taking off for hours at a time hunting, looking for legendary animals/fish, and just poking around.  I don't get to game very often, or for long stretches at a time, so I do enjoy the distractions.  If you are looking to play this game just for the story, then you may not like it.  The gun fights are not terribly hard, but I never felt the combat was the focus in RDR either.
When you do activate a character task or main story line, you do end up riding somewhere next to other NPCs and talking to them.  Just don't mainline the tasks and that won't be a big deal.
Yes the map is large and it may take a long time to get around, but the idea here is an open world environment for a cowboy, what did you expect.  You can fast travel after you upgrade Arthur's campsite, you can ride the train (either legally or illegally), you can ride a coach or you can ride your horse.  In my opinion it is very authentic.
You have to feed yourself or you get too thin, which can impact your stats.  You need to feed and brush your horse, and overall bond with your horse.  Neither of these activities seem to impact the game too much, at least not that I've found, but they do add another level of authenticity to the cowboy experience.
There are tasks and activities to do everywhere.  That to me has been a little overwhelming, but I haven't really focused on anything in particular.  The landscaping is so realistic that I've probably missed many of the objects NPCs have asked me to find (example: dinosaur bones, dream catchers, stone sculptures).  I've only really focused on fishing for the legendary fish.

Cons for me are limited to character movement.  Arthur tires out if you try to run too much.  Doing tasks for the camp are tedious (moving bags, chopping wood, feeding horses).  Yes your horse will tire when running, but take a trip up to the snowy mountains and find a white arabian horse that is on it's own, and you will have a good fast horse.

I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes to play an experience without wanting to mainline a story.  Maybe I will have a different opinion when I finish, after experiencing more repetition, but I'm having fun so far.  No multiplayer just yet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_134?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=134&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Like:
I like the graphics. I like the immersion and the voice acting. I like how much effort went into creating this game. It is very detailed. It is very immense. It is beautiful. The writing is superb. Every NPC seems to have a story. Every interaction has weight behind it.  It feels like what you do makes a difference to the other people in the game. Once you get to the first town, you can do whatever you want. You can sit and play dominos with an NPC. You can choose from a myriad of quests which turn out to be very narrowly guided interactive stories where you usually end up shooting bad guys.

Dislike: It feels slow. The walking is literally like being overburdened in a Bethesda game, but that's the regular speed of movement.  I understand they do this to help with immersion and to make a player feel invested in the actions occurring in the game, and to make people pay attention to the atmosphere, but it isn't easy to play this way after using characters in other PS4 titles that move so much quicker and easier.

The complexity. I'm a casual gamer, so my view on the complexity is simply that I don't want to invest so much time in learning all of the controls. There are a massive of button combinations and things to remember. When I go on a mission or a quest, I want to feel successful. I often fail the first time, second time, and third time. That makes this game feel like a slog, rather than an enjoyable relaxing adventure I can enjoy during my preciously meager free time.

At this point, I want to go back to playing God of War or Horizon Zero Dawn simply because I felt elation and fun while playing those games. I am really trying to give RD2 my full attention, but I'm not sure it can capture my attention long term. I just don't have the time to walk around slowly and to fail quests multiple times.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's because people lack patience nowadays.

The amount of detail which has gone into each and every single aspect of this game truly makes me wonder whether the developers working on this game are superhumans! They must have spent a lot of sleepless nights on this game.

I wasn't a huge fan of RDR1, mainly because the game was limited by the hardware of the last generation of consoles. RDR2 has no such issues. Unlike the GTA series which is usually satirical, RDR2 is an earnest attempt at recreating the world of late 19th century. The story is one of the greatest ever. It could be made into a TV series and would easily trash WestWorld and rival GOT. I haven't met a better bunch of characters since at least MassEffect 2. The gun combat isn't fluid because the weapons of that era weren't great, and the game accurately portrays that.

To give you an example of how detailed the game is, the weapons in the game rust if you don't maintain them and the rust mechanism reflects the real world (I'm a Materials Engineer). If you follow a random NPC in the game for a day, you'll see that they actually live their own lives in the game and aren't just placed there randomly to fill the world.

RDR2 will easily win game of the year, beating God of War (which was the leading contender till now IMO). A game of this caliber comes only once or twice a decade. My advice to you, give the game an honest shot. It's slow to build, but will not let you down.

Every developer at Rockstar Games should be proud of himself/herself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But, it still needs to improve. At least, I don’t cuss and throw my controller across the room as much as I used to.

A lot of the things that drove me into a rage aren’t occurring anymore (such as, the random death of a passerby when my horse accidentally bumped them, causing me to have a bounty 40 times higher than wanted criminals; or, being killed by a random cougar every time I went into cinematic mode, and losing the 40 pelts I’d spent 400 hours collecting). OMG, just thinking about how bad it was upon release infuriates me.

But... with each new patch, it gets a little better. So, I’ve raised my score from one star to three. Hopefully, one day, I’ll bump it all the way to five.

GREAT graphics.
HORRIBLE gameplay.

GREAT options.
HORRIBLE controls.

GREAT open world.
BORING open world.

The story is boring.
The main character is boring.
The side characters are boring.
The story characters are boring.
Even the animals are boring.

What’s the best part of the game? The amazing array of chores. I mean, if you enjoy doing chores in a video game.

This game is a massive disappointment.
And, worse: a massive waste of time.

You’d be better off playing the first one.

Brown","Sorry but this is a terrible game","January 8, 2019","To start off this game has spectacular graphics; that being said considering the next gen tech this is like saying your new car has working brakes.

  The story is boring and made worse by being as slow as a sloth taking a nap.  None of the characters are interesting or even noteworthy, especially the main character you play.  For some reason this was made as a game before RDR1 in the timeline and yet despite John being in the game you are not John...which is weird at best and horrible at worst.
  The gameplay itself is clunky and just not fun.  You find so many places and things in the world and yet there is no fun, no excitement, no feel of success as you plod through mindlessly over and over until you die.  The missions are boring as well as kind of stupid and leave a gunfight to end up driving a wagon....that's right; your high octane game has you driving a wagon from one of the world to the other for no reason other than to reduce the fun of this game.  You do jobs with your ""gang"" (yeah some gang most just sit around and eat eggs) and half the time my character never got my share of the money which does not matter because ALL weapons are locked and cannot be bought.....because why have a gunsmith store if you can actually buy things like in the first game.
  To top all this off the actual game controls and movements are terrible.  I died at least 37 times from being within 20 feet of a cliff because turning around requires a wide circle area for a man on foot and he would fall off he cliff in his convoluted, badly programmed turning mechanic.  Add in the game somehow will constantly reset your default weapon (whichever you used previously) to whatever will be 100% ineffective so that the fun can be reduced further to the programmer's destination of absolute zero.  Horses will leap fences and boulders yet a tiny pebble or a tree branch 50 feet away will send you flying off your horse, 20 feet through the air...to go over a cliff and die.
  The hunting is absolutely crazy.  You need to scan 1,000 animals to find the pristine animal and then you need a perfect shot with that animal's perfect weapon to get anything you can use and if the tiniest thing happens, like wind....trash quality which cannot be used or even sold for decent amount.
  Finally there is no fast travel in this game.  Now some will tell you that yes there is fast travel; No there isn't.  You work your butt off to get a map and you can go to a spot only to find out you are stuck there with no fast travel back.  You can buy train tickets; yet not getting paid and money being low levels means this is not realistic option.  Basically plan on spending, no joke here, literally hours watching your character ride a horse from one place to another.

Gentry","At Least Now I can Hide the Bodies","October 27, 2018","As a fan of the original RDR this one's been long overdue. As of my limited playing time on RDR2, one of my only criticisms is that the controls are a little too involved and some of the characters on the game are suffering accidental killings from me getting things crossed up. Some of these folks I only intended to talk to and ended up having to carry their bodies around looking for a nice hiding spot for them.
Some people might enjoy that aspect of the game, shoot first ask questions later. Others probably need to spend more time learning the controls before guessing again which button does what.
I did high center a stagecoach on a log and froze the whole game up, couldn't move forward or backwards. I couldn't even get off the stagecoach. Luckily I was in a mission and it timed out.
Weird bug though.
Only other criticism I have is, I sort of hope the story doesn't get too involved, having to read books along the way and look at photos...talk to certain individuals about something I'll need later down the road. I feel like the controls are complex enough without needing to keep up with everyone's backstory.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_124?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=124&reviewerType=all_reviews"

RDR2 ain't perfect - far from it - but it's a superb, immersive experience with an outstanding narrative and some of the best written characters ever to be found in video games. It is NOT an action game and that's where the poor reviews are coming from. I get that a slower, more immersive experience isn't for everyone, but that doesn't mean it's poor. Far from it.

I gave it 5 stars but that doesn't mean it's perfect. Here's my Tl;Dr review: RDR2 has an outstanding and ground-breaking game world BUT its systems for how you interact with that world are often mediocre and frequently frustrating.

Yet the game world and the narrative and the immersive aspects of the game are done SO well that it's a can't miss gaming experience for anyone interested in that type of game. The quality of the game world alone, and the awe-inspiring visuals, give me great hope for the future of games.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_132?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=132&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So I pre-ordered and picked up @Gamestop Launch Night 9PM.  I'm about 3-hours into the game (gotta work today), so here's my quick first impressions.

Conclusion:  It's gorgeous, full of options, and I probably will NOT play this as much as I did RDR (see The Ugly)

***The Good***
* Visuals - amazing graphics, detailed animations, weather, and condition changes to appearances of just about everything
* Content - chock full of everything from looting to hunting to robbery to heisting to gambling to everything else you could imagine
* Pace - much slower than the mad, mad, mad world of most FPS which fits the weapons, time period, and play style well
* Cinematic Camera - creates cut-scene movie in-game so I can avoid manual travel with NPCs

***The Bad***
* Controls - Want a good laugh?  Go to Settings - Controls - First Person Controls (Standard) and watch as your ONE configuration rotates through 3 full controller sets of details (near too fast to read anything btw).  That means your 15-button controller has 45-commands and that's just in First Person view, on Foot.  There's also Third Person view and both views for on foot, in vehicle and on horse.  You'll memorize all that after the 1st camp tutorial, right?

* Install -- 100GB will take 50-minutes (2-blurays) before you can actually play.  Hey Rockstar.  Remember when Blizzard solved that problem on Battle.net when they install the first 10%, then let you play while the remaining 90% continues to install.  Maybe you could learn that lesson.

***The Ugly***
* Tedious -- management of too many status, too much travel, too many details.  Remember when games used to be fun?  I know it's exciting to have the $ and dev teams to create all the glorious details so we experience EVERYTHING, but what you forget is we do NOT want to experience everything.  I do not want to press 7-different buttons to cut back the skin of the ONE animal I just shot (it wasn't that bad, but I need to make a point).  If I want to jump in to fast-travel to a place I've already been to pickup the whatever-I-forgot-and-need, I want to do that from the BEGINNING of the game (I hear it's available later).  Give us the option.  Remember difficulty - Easy-Normal-Hard?  This is NOT a casual pickup & play game.  It's more experiencing the ol'West.  As a result, given my busy REAL-life, I probably won't make it to the end of this one.

***My Hope***
* Gunslinger Gang -- potential in co-op online multiplayer.  I'm looking for a quick & fun, pickup Billy the Kid & gang vs. posse with my bros.  But to make that fun, they will need to turn down the onerousness.  Will see...","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

POSITIVES
1) The game is bigger(which isn’t always better, but in this case it is).
 2) The game is prettier( the enviornments are just gorgeous, and the lighting is some of the best I’ve ever seen in a video game next to Horizon Zero Dawn).
3) Provides the best exploration I’ve ever experienced in a Rockstar game(the game world is full of fun and interesting things to see and do, unlike GTA5’s open world which felt like it was full of things to see, but nothing particularly fun to do outside of the main story and certain stranger missions).
3) The story and dialogue is in a league of its own when it comes to Rockstar titles . It’s easily the most epic( and devastating) tale Rockstar has ever told.
4) Arthur Morgan joins the ranks of fantastic Rockstar protagonists with ease. He’s just as likable as good old John Marston except he’s effortlessly badass and much more flawed. The voice actor is just damn good (all the voice acting is damn good to be honest) and he fills Arthur with a commanding presence that makes every line of dialogue he speaks a pure joy to listen to.
5) The cast is fantastic! I truly came to care for almost every member of the gang(Hosea, Lenny, Charles, and Sadie are absolute stand outs to me for different reasons).
6) The gameplay is mostly superb. Epic gun play, smooth horse riding, and melee combat that is greatly improved over that mess in Red Dead Redemption.
NEGATIVES
1)Gameplay doesn’t always respond the way you want it to
2)Your preferred gun load out will be changed against your will at multiple points in the story.
3)Certain NPC’s are prone to overreact
BOTTOM LINE
Rockstar has outdone themselves. Get this game and experience everything i’ve mentioned and a whole hell of a lot I haven’t for yourself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The developers obviously put a ton of time and love in this version. Sure, there are some valid complaints and annoyances but this version is pretty amazing.

The characters and their interactions are more complex and interesting in this new version. A lot more time was put into the story and the scripted lines. The fight scenes and gun battles seem more realistic and immersive. I have the PS3 first version and this second PS4 version and the graphics are better and I find the AI behavior and movements more natural.
You’ll probably find Arthur Morgan growing on you much like John Marston did in the first version.

I’m not sure why there are some one star reviews unless the buyers were unfamiliar as to what this game is about.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The openness of the world is perfect for the Wild West atmosphere and the independent environment made it incredibly immersive. My favorite memory was coming across 2 rams butting heads that suddenly stopped when a pack of wolves howled and then chased them away. My favorite feature of all has to be the horses. Their movement is so life-like and coming from an equestrian background it was nice to finally have a game where I felt attached to my horse and was genuinely afraid of losing any of them.  While the end is disappointing it is fitting for the characters. The epilogue however is a total bore!! I barely made it through the first few missions without wanting to walk away. Ultimately the online saves this game with its free roam and fun co-op story missions. Hopefully as the online advances it will continue to fix some various bugs and add more elements to an already fantastic base.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This is a grownup game. People saying it takes long to travel or is boring etc must have played for 5 seconds. This is the greatest rpg since Skyrim to me. The detail is incredible, the interactions with npcs run the gamut from normal to the truly bizarre. It is a western. What do the players think they are going to do?

I’ve been playing video games for over 30 years.  The story on this game is absolutely the best I’ve ever played.  The way the characters are portrayed throughout the story is almost like watching a movie.  The game is so long that it really makes the entire journey through the game enjoyable.  It doesn’t ever get boring or too drawn out.  I didn’t do a lot of the side missions and that could have prolonged the game even more.  The ending was fantastic as well. Really the only negatives to this game is it had to end and I don’t know if I’ll ever play another game that can live up to this one.  It was challenging enough that you die in it but not so hard that it becomes frustrating or so easy that it becomes boring.  I even watched the credits at the end as they periodically show continuations of certain parts of the story, which was a cool touch.  Just a remarkably done game.  I’m a big fan of the Far Cry games but they don’t come close to this one.  I could go on and on, just get it and enjoy it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Not only does it do it brilliantly, but it gives you a whole open world to explore with it and what a sight it is to behold.  You can literally just stare at this game for hours taking in the scenery.  This game in many ways is still very similar to the first game, but with extra added layers and mechanics at play especially with inventory management.  No longer can you carry all your guns like the first game, but have to actually utilize your horse.  Think of your horse as a vehicle with a trunk to store all your gear.  Like in real life, you can’t carry everything so have to manage what to bring or not bring with you into a fight at least when you get off the horse.  This approach to realism is simply the game’s major achievement, but also could be a deterrent for some which is why it may not be everybody.  I’ll give some examples.

What’s great about video games is that they can streamline a lot of monotonous experiences in our lives.  Wouldn’t it be nice to just be able to dress or grab supplies without ever moving a finger?  What if we can just teleport to work on days we don’t feel like driving through traffic?  In games, we have a knack for always looting bodies or buildings because the supplies magically appear in our inventory with the push of a button.  RDR reminds us that life isn’t quite that simple.  If you are accustomed to grabbing or doing everything, you are going to see your character actually do it.  Want to grab a can of food, Arthur will grab it and he grabs them one by one.  Want to loot a body, Arthur will pick up the body and rummage through their pockets.  Want to skin the dead animal you just killed, Arthur will show you his skill with the knife.  If you think you can do this after just robbing a home and killing the folks there, you might just have used valuable time of escaping lawmen or bounty hunters who are coming your way.  There are those and having to eat when Arthur is hungry or showering when he’s dirty.  You don’t just go into the bathroom and he will be clean either.  You will have to scrub him with button prompts or pay someone to do it for you.  You also have to provide for your camp and take care of your horse when it gets dirty or agitated.  If all of these sound intrusive to your gameplay experience, it all depends on you as a gamer.

Keep in mind you are not forced to do any of these, but it's a good idea to do so as it makes the character perform better and the people around you react to you better.  How you deal with the realism in a game depends if you buy into the world and rules it sets which this game does convincingly.  You can go explore and do whatever you please without the worry of a level ranking.  I like this aspect more to my games honestly.  I don’t like to be reminded that games are simply work.  Leveling up can sometimes feel like a grind.  In RDR2, it's all about the narrative and exploring the beautiful, vast world.  It feels like you are playing a real character that truly lives in this world.

The realism gets only more enhanced with how dense the world is.  The unique encounters you find along with the buildings and areas you can enter only immerse you even more.  The weather effects in this game are simply amazing.  This sequel, to me, is doing to the first game what GTA 4 did to all the prior GTA games before it.  Whether you enjoy that experience depends entirely all on you and I'm all for it.

This game is definitely Rockstar’s masterpiece.  I didn’t even mention about the story, but if you played the first game.  You will appreciate what the game delivers in the end.  If you want to see what this game offers, definitely finish it to the end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_127?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=127&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The attention to detail in this game is absolutely incredible.  All of you movements seem as painful and labored as they should be for a man in your condition.  Arthur stumbles down slopes just like my grandpa did when I was little and he was chasing after his dog who escaped out the front door.  Just like I would if I were in pain and high on anesthesia, everything Arthur does is slow and with a long delay from the controller input.
Speaking of controller, Rock Star stuck with the same control scheme they've been using since the PS2 days, so you won't be burdened with any unfortunate modern ergonomic improvements.  Remember Super Mario 64?  How stupid was that?  They used a pressure sensitive thumb stick, and you just pushed it forward more to move faster, and less to move slower.  Thankfully, Rockstar doesn't make you endure that.  They understand that run buttons are still the way.  Thankfully too, Arthur has arthritis in both knees, so his top speed isn't too fast to ruin the pacing of the game.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I haven't read any of the positive reviews of the game but I imagine none of them praise it for it's edge-of-your-seat, adrenaline pumping action or it's smooth and non-repetitive game mechanics.  The negative reviews pretty much hit the nail on the head. I knew I had made a mistake after the hour it took slogging around in the snow and searching a tiny cabin.  I figured once the snow thawed, things would finally pick up.  Nope.  The weather changed but the game just dragged on and on, and on.  It's just not fun.  I never really played the first Red Dead so this can't be chalked up to dashed expectations.  As with so much else in life, it's difficult for me to see how anyone believes this is objectively good.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_124?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=124&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Unfortunately this game is not as good. There are enjoyable moments but the control system is so clunky and badly designed it really does ruin a lot of the game play. It takes so long to get anything done that you can’t become fully immersed in the story. I understand that crafting and lifelike maintenance of characters is a really popular thing right now with many players and game companies; with that being said, there’s are good ways of designing it and bad ways of designing it, this game is one of the bad ways. I personally hate being forced to take care of a characters every need. Up until now I haven’t said anything about it because I don’t want to deminish another player’s enjoyment of a game that is designed like that, but this game makes character maintenance so time consuming and minute I feel like I’m at work instead of enjoying a game to relax. If there was an option to turn those things on or off it might be a little better, but it would still leave the terrible control layout and the unbelievable amount of menus and sub menus you have to deal with constantly. I guess if you know someone who really wants the game they have to judge for themselves but personally I’m disappointed in it but am trying to make my way through it. It gets 2 stars for quality of story work, voice acting, and graphics.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_135?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=135&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Much more challenging in my opinion over the first RDR. Very cool customization for horse, character, and weapons. Great story and really sets up the story for the first RDR. One thing I wish was different was that if you don’t do certain side missions as you progress through the game, you won’t be able to do them past a certain point. And it is very annoying when you run into a tree with your horse or run into a person on the street and get a huge bounty.

I really enjoy running around with my friends doing missions on the map. Other players have the opportunity to counter our missions and I really enjoy that aspect of the game. Nothing better that fighting another posse over a train or stage coach. As I write this the online is still only a beta, and we are dealing with a lot of glitches and such but even with the problems I love this game. People complain about a broken economy but I believe they just want instant gratification. I personally want to work my way up as I play.

Danzig","How the West Could Have Been More Fun","February 21, 2019","Now that I've put in many more hours playing this game, I have warmed up to it. But be prepared for a LONG period of frustration and boredom in the beginning before the game play picks up.

In particular, the save system is the worst I've encountered on any PS4 game, and probably the worst in years.

The game will NOT auto-save -- or let you save -- for stretches of time in excess of a half an hour in places!

This means that unless you are willing to keep your PS4 on overnight, say, you could be forced to replay a good half an hour or more of game play that is often considerably less than enthralling, like watching your protagonist ride a horse and ride a horse and engage in a far-from-memorable conversation.

Further eroding the appeal of this alleged AAA title are some horribly complex and cumbersome controls. Rather than design controls according to accepted industry standards -- or even make sure that the controls are consistent throughout this one game -- it seems as if the developers made up new control routines as they went along, hoping that a brief prompt would help you through a critical moment (and not force you to revisit an excruciatingly long half hour of your life again!)

Yes, the game is a technological wonder, a vivid recreation of a living, breathing, often breathtaking world. But in many sequences this world has been created with too little devotion to the core reason you're playing a game -- to have fun!

I would have thought that the creators of the GTA games would know better by now, but apparently not.

On the positive side, RDR2 gives you hours of ""play"" for the dollar as most open world games do. But whether you will actually enjoy a lot of the play here is another question. Living in a state where recreational marijuana is legal might help some players through some of the endless slogs on horseback.

Caveat emptor!

UPDATE: I am currently more than 70% through the game. The main story has concluded, and now I am playing a protracted epilogue focused on John Marston and his efforts to become a rancher. Unfortunately, the save points seem to be fewer and further between again, the controls are still wonky in the extreme, and the game has more bugs than a well-populated bee hive.

I have fluctuated between giving this game three and four stars and am now leaning toward three. There are just too many problems on display here. I hope Rockstar will redeem themselves with the next Grand Theft Auto...

UPDATE NUMBER TWO: Well, I have now finished the main story of RDR2. I will say that the ending was very satisfying -- more than most of the game itself!

In fact, I have just started playing yet another open world game, the latest in the Far Cry series, New Dawn, and -- that game is INFINITELY more fun to play than RDR2!!!

So ultimately I believe that Rockstar laid a cow pie with this bloated oater, which is of interest primarily to equestrians and Wild West devotees. Others can find much more enjoyable open world games to play (including the recent Far Cry games, the latest Tomb Raider, and Mad Max).

Next time around, I hope Rockstar will not again opt for quantity over quality...","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was a huge fan of the first rdr and logged over 200 hours in it. However, a little under 20 hours for this sequel and i want to close the game and never come back.

Sure the game is extremely beautiful and is full of intricate details that fascinate you ok how much attention the developers put in, but the story and gameplay is simply not there.

The story is mundane and cliche, gunplay is awkward at best, and many activities feel more like a chore than a game. For example, who thought it was a good idea to make you spend 5 minutes riding back to your camp after every mission? The free roam feature doesn’t seem so free anymore once you realize it is required.

Anyways, i just feel like rdr2 is not nearly worth the perfect scores out there. It feels like either the reviewers were paid off or were playing a completely different game. People who are die hard fans of the first rdr surely do not help with their extremely biased opinions. In general I would avoid this game unless you like playing games like truck simulator or farm simulator.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_125?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=125&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The world is beautiful to explore and look at. The story is well told when you're not stuck riding a horse around for ten minutes.

The bad:  The focus on realism is a conscious design choice. Whether you like it or not comes down to what you expect from a game. Do you enjoy micro managing aspects of your day to day life and doing chores? Well this is the game for you.

The ugly: The controls are terrible. A game is meant to be played. I have never played a game with less intuitive controls. If I end up dying or being chased for a crime, it's generally because I accidently drew my gun on little Timmy and his innocent dog. The game feels downright terrible to control.

And you sit, frustrated, while that hero NPC makes every important decision, steals every spotlight, and ultimately swipes the climax for themselves? This is that game.

It seems like most reviews are from people who haven't finished the game... They either love the visuals and slow burn pacing and rush to a 5 star review. Or they HATE the slow burn pacing and quit with low stars. But for all those people who are on the fence, or slogging through to see the end, here's my advice... Don't bother.

This story is the most bafflingly terrible, LEAST satisfying story I've ever come across. And I personally LOVE the slow burn pacing! (Just know, of that 60 hours of story time, you will spend at least half that riding back and forth through the wilderness on horseback.) The problem is that the writers are not the least bit concerned with YOU, the player. Or with Arthur, the character. The NPCs are the leads in this old west tale.

Over the course of the story, the writers build up all kinds of dramatic tension. And you will be waiting for your chance to step in and make a difference. For you, the PLAYER, to have your moment...

Sorry. It's not going to happen.

This story is about the NPCs. You're just along to watch and run errands. In the end, none of your decisions will have made a difference. None of your actions will carry any consequence. You will never have your moment. None of those equipment upgrades will count. Literally NOTHING you have done, or WANT to do, will matter. It's just one long railroad to the end. Where the writers' favorite NPCs can step in and steal the show. You'll just sit by and watch.

You, the PLAYER, aren't the protagonist. You're the captive audience. Truly disgraceful storytelling.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_136?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=136&reviewerType=all_reviews"

That being said, what I saw of the game was enough to make me think to myself, ""Why is this game so beloved??"" In my eyes, the game had ugly, poorly rendered graphics, an uninteresting plot, boring characters, slow gameplay, and waaaaaaaay too much open, empty space and no way to fast travel. Note: I was casually playing Zelda: Breath of the Wild on my Switch while also observing this person playing RDR2, and frankly I have to say that Breath of the Wild was doing a way better job of keeping my interest. Every time I looked up at the other game, I noticed again how boring or crude it was. Hey, maybe RDR2 just isn't my type of game, and I can accept that. But still, I honestly don't get the hype, and how people think it's such a beautiful, engaging masterpiece, when all I witnessed was a boring, tedious, ugly, merely average game.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_136?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=136&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I played RDR1 when it came out and it was an awesome game, especially for its time. Now, RDR2 have some improvements, especially in the graphics, but this game is more like a movie than a game. I personally feel that the team that made this wanted to tell a story instead of a game. Well here is some hot points:

PROS:
1. The graphics are awesome. Very beautiful work, the animals react life like. Beautiful scenery as well.
2. The map is awesome that it includes the original RDR1 map plus the new addition. That gives you LOTS of room to roam and see what you can get yourself into.
3. You do have plenty of freedom after you complete the story. Have lots of fun being the terror of the west.

CONS:
1. Your horse, it at times can act completely stupid. I do not know who programmed that part, but they have apparently have never been on a horse before if you ask me. Horses do not run into cliffs intentionally.
2. You can go on a crime spree, but do not do it in a city. They never seem to run out of cops and bounty hunters, no matter how many you send off to a dirt nap.
3. When you dismount from your horse, better check your weapons. It seems like anytime you dismount, all your rifles will stay on the horse and you have to go back and get them again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

RDR2 is an absolute masterpiece of an experience. 10x more detailed than anything they've done before with characters just as fun and interesting, story just as well written, and a world worthy of exploration.

The graphics are AWESOME. The Detail is Awesome! Yes you have to ride your horse around but you can switch to cinematic mode and it goes faster. Yes it is slower to walk in camp but jeez people don't be so impatient.
The story is awesome. Arthur Morgan is one of the best characters ever and in the online version you can create one that looks similar to Arthur.
PS4 is the best console and RDR2 and Gods of War are 2 pf the best games.

I grew up playing the original grand theft auto on the PlayStation 1 and the last game I purchased was GTA 5 a few years ago due to nostalgia, but it still delivered, and so does Red Dead Redemption 2.  I remember playing the original Red Dead Redemption back when I was a bachelor and on pre-deployment for Afghanistan in 2010. I spent so many hours on the game and loved every minute. As soon as I heard a new one was coming out I knew I would have to get it.

I've read a variety of reviews and I can see where they are coming from when they say this is boring and slow. You have to immerse yourself in the game to fully enjoy it, its not a game you can turn on to kill 10 minutes or have a quick gunfight. As this is a prequel to the original, it is nice to see the origin of some of these characters.

*Warning, spoilers ahead.*

The main story is amazing and incredibly detailed.
Once you get to chapter 2 the majority of the map opens up to you and you'll be exploring for hours.
The whole world here is incredibly detailed, there so many species of animals to track down and hunt.
I love the fact the original Red Dead Redemption map opens up towards the end of the story, but I wish there was more to do with it. Not much really happens in this area.
The main antagonist, Arthur Morgan, is such a lovable character, whether you play him as a good or a bad outlaw. I really felt like there was something missing after he died when you continue as John Marston. Its a shame once you fully complete the story there is no option to bring him back just to play as.
The gameplay can be frustrating and unforgiving, this can annoy you but adds some realism to the game.
I was expecting a lot more stranger missions and opportunities to pull off epic bank heists, but this may be in development with downloadable content.

When rdr2 came out, I bought it right away. It's a different game from the first one, but it's still awesome. It starts out a little slow, but gets better and better as the game goes on. If you have not played rdr games, i suggest playing the second one first, and then play the first one. The story was complex and engaging.

I was SO disappointed. The speed of movement (in camp, in the first few missions, even travelling across the map on a running HORSE) was so slow I literally fell asleep. But if you have the time to get past this initial giant tutorial, it really opens up. You can ignore things like chores around camp and sleeping/eating/cooking. My experience vastly improved once I realized this. (Not sure who those details are geared towards but I don't need more chores in my life.) The setting is gorgeous. The characters are hilarious (though I got more attached to some of the side quest characters than a lot of the NPCs in camp). There's a lot to do - and if you don't want to do it, for the most part, you don't have to. The absolute worst part for me is that you're penalized for looting corpses and property (of people you weren't penalized for murdering!) in multiple ways - your morality dips (meh) and you can easily fail missions by ""abandoning"" your side quest buddies walking 5 steps to loot a body. The whole point of almost every mission is the need for more money - you know a quick source of money? The 20+ bodies we just left behind after a shootout at the mansion...

I can't even sort out the good from the bad, but I will definitely keep playing. The longer I've played, the more the good outweighs the bad. Just started Chapter 4 where supposedly the story picks up. I do think the game is overhyped but it's slowly (SLOOOOOWLY) winning me over.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Honestly the people complaining I feel just have a complete lack of patience.

Once you get a hang of the controls and how to play the game though the game is probably the best game of the decade. I haven’t seen better graphics in a game, very few bugs on release - stupidly polished, great soundtrack, plenty of things to do, and it has an amazing story.

You don’t even have to play to enjoy it, husband let me play through it the first time, and he was glued to screen. The story and visuals are enough to hold up on its own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I just sent this to Rockstar Games...

I just purchased the Ultimate Edition of RDR2 and I'm extremely dissapointed in the graphics of this game.  Had I known the game was going to look like this (not even close to GTA5) I would have never purchased it.  After spending hours trying to get HDR to work, I finally went online and saw the issue isn't isolated to me.  So I followed others advice and disabled HDR in the game.

This did help the game's graphics a little, but it seems like it's blurry, too dark at many times, has a layer of graininess, and the motion blur or whatever that's going on seems to make things worse.

I can't believe the step down from GTA5 graphics.  This game was built for this gen platform yet it seems like many steps backwards.

Are you guys trying to fix this, or is this what I'm stuck with.  The game play seems to be fun, but these graphics literally hinder me from seeing animals, sometimes people, etc. and truly make this a very unpleasant experience.

Edit*
Want to add what I play on.
Playstation 4 PRO with Samsung SSD
Sony Bravia xbr65x850e (less than 2 years old)don't have issues playing any other 4k HDR games
Sony STRDN1080 stereo

So my equipment should not be an issue.  And like I said it works fine with any other 4k HDR game.

The main issue is HDR doesn't work, but when you disable that there is no brightness settings in the game to adjust.  So you have to start adjusting your TV settings which basically messes up all your settings for other games/movies/etc...","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_125?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=125&reviewerType=all_reviews"

(my suggested new title)","November 16, 2018","RDR2 has been a huge disappointment for me. It may have the most beautiful scenery of any video game ever, but that is all it has. To put it mildly, it's a poorly written movie posing as a video game. Everything is slow: controls, dialog, aiming, Arthur picking stuff up, putting it down, cut scenes you can skip followed by 3-5 minutes of traveling on your horse/in a carriage with part of the gang while they blab all about the irrelevant backstory. The story is hopelessly redundant: Gang gets in trouble, gang shoots itself out of trouble & gets in more trouble, gang needs to move - rinse and repeat. The script is a magnificent work of masturbatory writing I've ever been forced to listen to and the dialog for the Stranger quests will have you screaming, ""Just spit it out!"" at the TV too many times for one day. Add all that to the fact there is no real 'game' in this single player, unless you consider having to go back and forth 100 times to achieve 10 things a game (imagine Skyrim or Fallout 4 w/o fast travel, yeah, it's annoying) and all you want to do is melt the disc down so no one else has to suffer like you did. Maybe it'll be worth the 68 bucks once multiplayer is released, but then Rockstar should have let us know that all we were paying for was one long, boring tutorial.

ETA: Just finished and what a total waste of time. Part I of the epilogue has 97% cut scenes, backstory scenes and, believe it or not, the guy working, yes, working. Who at Rockstar thought people would enjoy playing a game that involved actual work on the part of their character? And it's quite obvious Rockstar has some well paid publicists or else we, the consumers, would have known how lame this game, scratch that, this made for Console Movie was before we paid for it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-PlayStation-4/product-reviews/B01M5DZ525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_126?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=126&reviewerType=all_reviews"

- Graphics, amazing
- Production value (you could tell from the painstaking detail that the programmers put their everything into this game)

Negative:
- Animations (while they are really detailed, the slowness can get annoying)
- Travel. This is a big one for me. You have to travel LONNNNNNNNNNG distances to get to where you are going and find action in this game. But travelling is not fun. It's very cinematic, it's very pretty, but it's not fun. Horses tire if you run too fast and the map is so big, except that that means there are wide areas of no activity in this wild west setting. Also, if you are galloping too fast and accidentally hit a rock, you will get thrown from your horse and die. Sometimes after travelling for a long distance.
- I swear Dead Eye was a lot easier to execute in RDR1.
- It's easy to accidentally kill NPCs. While that may sound hilarious, it's not. Especially when you are trying to accomplish an objective in the town and they all turn on you because you accidentally brushed an NPC on your horse and they ridiculously died or got hurt enough to qualify as assault. I guess this and the last couple critiques qualify as control issues.

The story itself is okay, so far. I'm about 8 hrs in and its not great, but its not terrible. The voice acting is very good, but a lot of the characters you engage with are not that particularly interesting.

I hope it picks up the more I play, but I am regretting getting the 80.00 version of this game. It takes a lot of time to progress through, and so far the payoff is not quite worth it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","",""
