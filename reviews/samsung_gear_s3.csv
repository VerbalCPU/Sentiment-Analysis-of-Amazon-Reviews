A number of features on it work great such as the step and floor counters and the heart rate monitor is neat. Some of the watch faces are quite epic and both useful and fun.

On the other hand this device for some reason cannot charge in a warm room and all sorts of terrible issues with it's bluetooth connectivity.

As far as I can tell your only true hope of stopping this device from answering calls and forcing you to talk to your wrist is to put it into ""do not disturb"" mode. Even this mode often fails and causes your phone to try to connect to the watch and then try to switch back to the phone's internal speaker. I've tested this issue with 3 different android phones from 3 different manufacturers. Today I have a pixel 2 xl - same issue. BTW if you disable phone connectivity via bluetooth in your phone settings this watch won't connect to it at all.

The samsung firmware updates have been of a random quality. For instance one update multiplied the battery use by like 500% then about ten days later they released a ""fix"" that had it back to normal.

Bottom line is while I like this watch hopefully some of it's fundamental issues are solved with the S4 or some other device.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've made and received calls via the watch just to have the experience of doing it; it is not the idea why to do things but it works great in a pinch.  I run the following apps on my watch: Phone, Contacts, Samsung Health, Weather, Samsung Pay, Music Player, Reminders, Alti-Barometer, Scheduler, Alarm, World clock, Gallery and of course find my phone.  I've also setup two different Calendars to send a notification to the watch too.
The phone works great but I don't want to talk into my wrist all the time, and you can move the call  you answered on your watch to your phone, which is what I did one time, it was easy. Contact, there is not much to say about that. Samsung Health is good, it tells you when you have climbed a set of stairs, as long as the stairs are more than 10 feet. It counts your steps, I'm at 4200 today and my goal is 6500, and the goal is easy to change. Heart rate monitor is fine you just need to wear the watch a little tighter than you are likely use to.  I found the heart rate to be accurate to my pulse\oxygen meter.  The weather is as accurate as accuweather is.  Samsung Pay works just like apple pay, easy to use and no problem to report. Music Player is best when your watch is paired with a Bluetooth headset.  I've not missed a meeting since the Scheduler has moved to my wrist. The Alarm, well it is an alarm and if will wake you up.  The World clock is helpful since I change time zones when I travel, now I don't wake the wife by calling when she is asleep.  The Gallery is the only one I think is kind of silly, the watch face is small for really viewing a picture.
My biggest concern was the battery life; with all these apps doing there thing and the always on watch face turned off I'm getting 4 days of use out of the watch battery.  I don't know what it would be if the watch face was always on but I'll be trying it soon.
I don't like a cluttered watch face, my current one has the time, date and battery status in percent.  I have 9 others watch faces stored on my watch so I'm ready. There are lots of free watch faces available.
I'm happy I selected the Samsung  Gear S3 watch.
By the way my first watch call was to my youngest son, whom has the same watch, I didn't know that until he told me he answered my call via his S3 watch.
I believe you will be happy with this watch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

While many of the reviews I've read complained about how big it is, it looks comparable to those Suunto Sport watches. I have very small wrists for a male, but I don't think the device looks over the top. For a woman, I might recommend the S2 as that is the one I bought for my wife and it fits her perfectly.

The overall function experience is pleasant to use and takes very little time to get acquainted to. Nearly every feature of the watch can be customized from the watch faces to the order of your apps. Reordering apps can be a little clunky on the watch face if you have big fingers but can also be accomplished from your smartphone. Many of the watch faces can be customized by color but also what information you want displayed. From a glance you can see the time in a different zone, your heart rate, a step count, weather, battery information, and a few other options.

Pairing the watch was seamless but took a couple of tries for system and app updates to go from my phone to the watch. Eventually it worked its self out. Notifications are viewed by rotating the bezel counter-clockwise and take about 1-2 seconds to transfer from your phone. I received messages via text and also whatsapp and was able to respond to both from the watch. Responses can either by voice dictation, voice message, hand writing, or old school predictive text. The voice dictation appeared to be fairly accurate and was by far the easiest. Hand writing was mostly accurate but very slow. The predictive typing can be tricky since the buttons are so small.

I have not taken or received voice calls through the watch but I listened to the devices speakers with music and it was a bit tinny. I probably won't take calls with this device unless I'm alone because I think it might look a bit silly.

I'm not much of an athlete so the S health features probably won't be used much. However the heart rate monitor appears to be accurate and the occasional reminder for you to get off your butt and move around a bit is a welcome addition. Playing around with the S health features does present me with a minor annoyance. Specific exercises are kinda buried in the app so if you want to set up a sit-up exercise, you're going to have to click through quite a bit.

The display is very sharp and brilliant. I can only partially make out individual pixels when I bring the watch close to my eye. I keep the display always on and it partially dims when my wrist is turned away. When I turn the face towards me, the display will increase illumination. I've never had to flick my wrist back and forth to get the display going so this feature is flawless. The side buttons have a good tactile feel with the lower being ""home"" and the upper being ""back"". Holding the back button will launch Samsung pay and double clicking the home button will launch an app of your choice.

The only reason I gave this device four stars instead of five is due to the quality of the bezel. It feels a little sloppy and doesn't give a satisfying click when rotating. Also tapping on it makes a clicky noise. It just feels like it could've been tightened up a bit.

Whether you pay full price for the device or if you got the discount, I think the price is fair for what you get. I haven't done as much research into other android smartwatches but the Gear S3 seems to be about as full featured as you can get.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_38?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=38&reviewerType=all_reviews"

As far as smartwatches go, it's among the classiest (sorry Apple Watch users, yours all look like calculator watches to me). My previous S2 Classic had an air of dignity about it... a sort of unassuming presence that promised to remain so long as you respected it, appreciated it, and met its expectations... Indeed, the S2 was an ideal companion for the most respectable of gentlemen and women...

Not this guy. This S3's a BEAST.

I chose the frontier because I had a tendency to, you know, do things with my arms that occasionally ran them into solid objects. These interactions would always terrify me. While the S2 had enough durability to withstand even my most wild gesticulations, I always worried that I'd end up killing it through some negligence then spend the next several days in deep regret.
Not the Frontier. This thing is about as rugged as you could want in a smartwatch. It's got all the friendly usefulness of the Gear line, with asolid rubber strap, sturdy steel frame, and the famous rotating bezel has those cool compass markings for when you get lost without cell service... And if you're the type of person who actually needs such a tough timepiece for whatever adventures you're on, you may actually find this feature useful. The battery life is a step up from the previous generation: It takes longer to charge and has a tendency to get hot, which halts the charging process. Actually, this would be the watches biggest downside if the battery life on my watch said anything less than 30% right now... but it says 60% and I haven't charged it in two days so I'm fine with waiting a little longer for a full charge.
This particular model is noticeable. It doesn't have the finesse of the Classic line, but it's still got all the class and flash worthy of the Galaxy name. The design is as pretty as ever and the notifications are an excellent excuse to keep looking at it. I've never been much one for Smartwatch Apps, and likely won't get into them so I'm not concerned with whether or not Samsung has developed any. The speaker and microphone functions give the watch more accessibility, and I can now voice record and possibly even talk over the phone, but likely won't since I still have an actual cell phone to fret over. I'm sure one day there will be an all in one of some sort.
So, I suppose the most effective overview I could give is this: The Frontier is the Gear model for those who want to do stuff outdoors. It now tracks altitudes as well as distance, has a strong and noticeable speaker for those quiet mornings without a headset, and looks as beautiful as ever on your wrist. As for downsides, the long charging time and tendency to heat up during charging are self-fixing, with the improved battery life and the average persons tendency not to wear a watch to bed with them (although you totally could and it would track your sleep for you). I'll post an update if this ever becomes an actual issue for me, but if it ever does I suspect enough time will have passed that the newest model will have already have a fix.

PSA - if at first your Gear does not charge, reset the watch. I know this seems counter intuitive, but wireless charging actually has a software aspect to it which is much more likely to be the source of the problem than the hardware. It's an easy fix and it worked immediately for me, which is why I didn't see it as a 'con' so much as an added step towards functionality. Only lazy people would complain about it, and I ain't lazy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_31?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=31&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Bezel lets you go more than one screen/option in one motion. I'm very active and the UI for my main app Endomondo is greatly superior to the AW version. The S Health has been terrific as well.

Samsung Pay. Wow. Using the watch to pay with the touch pad OR the magnetic strip is great. No more wondering if a sore had the touch pad for phone payments. Plus the added benefit of not needing to pull out the phone!

My biggest criterion were that it had to be reasonably sized, reasonably priced, have GPS, and be able to have offline maps.  I really liked the look of the Gear S3 Frontier and the Galaxy watches (let's be real - the new 42mm Galaxy watch in black is basically the Frontier's little brother), and I LOVE the rotating bezel.

I tried out both the S3 Frontier and the Galaxy watch and came to the following conclusions.
1) Look - the style of both watches are very similar (which you can see from the product photos).
2) Size - the 46mm Frontier watch is obviously larger than the 42mm Galaxy.  The watch band on the Frontier is thicker and has a slightly wider style that made it look larger than it actually is.  I ended up buying a smaller band similar to the style on the Galaxy to remedy this.  For me, the 42mm Galaxy wins on size.  The screen was only slightly smaller, but the watch as a whole was much smaller (as you can see from my comparison pictures).  The thickness of the two watches is about the same.
3) Rotating Bezel - I found the bezel on the Frontier was easier for me to use.  It's slightly taller than the one on the Galaxy, and the notches on the side are bigger.  The Galaxy bezel fit into the face of the watch a bit more smoothly, so you have to rotate it from the top of the watch, whereas on the Frontier you can rotate it from the side or top.
4) Navigation - navigation through the different widgets and apps was very intuitive on both watches.  You can use the bezel or touchscreen to move through items, and the two buttons on the side to select and navigate.
5) Maps - ultimately this was the item that tipped the scale in favor of the Frontier for me.  There's an app you can download called HERE WeGo which provides directions from your location to your destination.  Very similar to how Google Maps works.  However, it also supports an offline functionality where you can download maps of an area (state / province / etc.) so you have them available without being connected to your phone.  The downside to this is that it doesn't have a satellite or topographic view, but I tested it out locally and the trails I took were all on there.  So if I go hiking somewhere and get lost, I have a general idea of where I am - I can see it on the map.  When I tested HERE WeGo on the new Galaxy watch it doesn't function unless you're connected to the phone, because you can't download offline maps to the Galaxy.  I checked with their support team and they said they will consider it for the future (but that doesn't help me now).

Ultimately I ended up keeping the S3 Frontier and returning the Galaxy.  The Galaxy won on size and waterproof rating, but I just couldn't justify spending almost double on the Galaxy when it wouldn't meet one of my biggest criterion (the offline maps).  It's no Suunto or Garmin or Casio, but for the price point it meets my needs as a GPS watch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Does pretty much anything you would expect a smart watch to do from step counting to receiving text messages.  Has a easy to navigate rotating bezel around the face that allow you to scroll through home screens or make app choices. Charging is completely wireless, but does not seem to be fast adaptive with the provided charging stand.  After using it for a few months now I'm still happy with it most of the time... It can get a little glitchy here and there switching between apps or opening a text message but it usually clears itself up without a restart... Plenty of options in face and band designs that will keep it looking like a new watch. However, be careful on accessory choices for this watch... There are several cheap and poorly designed bands and screen protectors that end up doing more harm than good....

For example, the watch app S Health exercises don't match/sync the phone app S Health exercises, and based on what I see in Samsung forums a recent update broke functionality related to messaging for a lot of people across device types and there is no timeline or communication from Samsung committing to a repair...text messaging is pretty basic for any smartwatch, is touted in the feature list on the amazon listing(as of 1/30) and even acknowledging that some non Samsung devices will have limited compatability, this appears to be a regression for a lot of people.  I wanted a reliable, feature rich but activity oriented smartwatch and this seemed to fit the bill, but it sounds like they are still working out the kinks and I didn't want a beta product.  Returning mine until they get these basics ironed out or stop trying to market like they work with anything other than Samsung phones in a consistent way...this could be a great watch.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I researched what smart watch I was going to buy for weeks before finally deciding to buy the Gear S3 Frontier and thought I made the right choice. I ordered the new ""US Version"", however when it came in the mail it was the International Version. This is a product that is fulfilled by Amazon, not a 3rd party supplier so I expected a little more coming from Amazon. The International Version doesn't have Samsung Pay, which I didn't plan on using anyway so I kept the watch. I started wearing the watch and immediately loved it. The sleep tracking, ability to receive and respond to text, make phone calls that you could actually hear, great fitness app and GPS. What more could you ask for, the watch worked flawlessly and I really liked it...then I washed my hands, like I do dozens of times a day because I'm a registered nurse and the watch was done. That's right, the watch barely got wet, it wasn't even submerged and it just stops working. Now I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 star, because Amazon did a very good job at refunding me for everything I bought to go with the watch including the silicone protector, tempered glass and the additional bands. That's right I even got add-ons for the watch to protect it and the darn thing still broke. In closing for those of you who are on the fence about a smart watch may I recommend a Garmin instead. That's what I'll be switching to and the Garmin was my second choice because it didn't have all of the functions of the Gear S3, however the Garmin watches are more robust and from the reviews can take a beating. So if after reading this you still decide to buy the Gear S3 Frontier, just remember I told you so. It is not a good choice!!!","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After graduating from a Garmin 110, I decided I would like a GPS watch with smartwatch features (sorry TomTom) and on board music (sorry Garmin). After a brief foray into the New Balance RunIQ which was a bit of a disaster, I decided on the Gear S3 mostly due to overwhelmingly good reviews from Amazon reviewers. Mainstream reviews range from average to great depending on how people feel about what a smartwatch is actually supposed to do. My main concerns for the Gear were its lack of apps/Tizen support and its general overall function as a running watch. I thought I would focus this review on using it as a running watch as I have not really seen any reviews that address this specifically.

Running/GPS: Overall, I would rate the Gear as an “OK” running watch. There is lots of potential, but I don’t think you should necessarily buy a 300$ device for its potential. There are many things I would like to change and would be easy to change, but right now it is what it is.

You are basically stuck tracking your runs in Samsung Health, the onboard fitness tracker for the watch. Generally I like S-Health, but it could be better and there aren’t really any other good options for tracking a run. There is a lot of hand wringing over the lack of 3rd party apps and fitness tracking. Under Armour released its “Suite” of apps a few months ago (Endomondo, Map My Run, and UA Record). They all function the same way and have the same coding, so it is strange to see three different version of the same basic app. I only used these apps a few times, but found them not too my liking and haven’t used them since. When I used them, the default GPS seems to want to connect through your phone. The reason I got this watch is to run without my phone! Through trial and error, I have found getting away from your phone’s GPS/Bluetooth connection forces your smartwatch GPS to get a signal and start tracking rather than piggybacking from your phone’s GPS (Samsung, can I have an option to only use the watch GPS for a run?). When you do this with the UA apps, it tells you that it can’t find a GPS signal and won’t allow you to start a run. This leads to starting your run under your phone’s GPS signal and potentially inaccurate tracking at the beginning of a run as your watch struggles to find a GPS signal after losing the phone GPS signal. My other problem with the UA apps is the layout (which is the same in all 3 apps). It has all your important run stats on the dashboard, but can’t fit them all on the screen. This forces you to scroll down if you want to see more metrics. This is a bit difficult mid run when you just want to glance down to check your pace. It also makes it too easy to accidentally pause your run as you fumble to scroll down and accidentally hit the upper section of the screen which will pause the run. Another death knell for the UA apps is there is no music functionality built in, so to change or check music mid run, you have to go out to the main menu and go to your selected music app (again, a very difficult proposition mid run). I’ll admit that I haven’t tested these apps in a while nor very exhaustively, but these were my initial impressions.

Samsung health then is the default and it generally works well. Here are my main problems with it and using the Gear S3 as a running watch in general.

1) GPS acquisition: When you start a run, it gives you a 3 second countdown, but hasn’t necessarily locked on to a GPS signal. As mentioned above, this leads to very inaccurate tracking for the beginning of my run. I have taken to starting a run, then immediately pausing and waiting for a few minutes before taking off. I live in a very wooded area and need a few minutes to get a good signal. I think this has helped, but it is not a 100% cure. Another technique I picked up online is to start an app like “Speedometer” that activates and keeps the GPS rolling then start your S Health run. I did this once and the GPS worked great, but I lost about 30 percent of my battery during a 30 minute run. Also, the Speedometer app kept showing up by default causing me to have to swipe down to get back to S Health. Could Samsung have an option to lock onto GPS before starting a run like hundreds of other dedicated GPS watches? Sure they could. Will they? Who knows.
2) General GPS accuracy: It seems OK apart from the above mentioned issue. I will say I have had a couple runs that have been way over distance. I have lost GPS signal a few times as well. This week I had to pause for traffic and lost a signal which caused a .2 mile loss. It is good enough for what I need, but if you are looking for highly consistent and accurate GPS, you need a Garmin. My old Garmin 110 which is 7 years old was more consistent and accurate than the Gear S3. I would say my runs deviate by anywhere from 3-5% which can affect your average pace. Don't get me wrong, the Garmin deviated too, but I hardly ever lost a signal and run distance deviation was minimal. Again, I feel like Samsung could tweak some options for runners for getting better GPS tracking (1 second refresh anyone?). I would gladly lose some battery for a better GPS experience.
3) General App data: There is a dashboard on the phone app which shows you your runs for the day/week/month. When you go into review a run, you get all your metrics. They recently added split times but they aren’t accurate. I frankly don’t know where they get the numbers because they are twice as high as my average mile time (which is oddly shown on the graph). Another deficiency is lack of course tracking. I run the same few loops regularly and like to compare my times day to day. Strava does this excellently. S-Health does not.
4) Strava integration: As mentioned above, S-Health isn’t a fully fleshed out database for crunching your numbers. But Strava is! You can push all your run data to Strava automatically by linking your account in S-Health. People have seemed to have trouble with this. I haven’t had trouble pushing the data, but I have noticed the data is completely different than what is in S-health. I’m not sure where the difference comes from. For instance, my most recent run in S-health was 28:46 at 3.6 miles. When ported over to Strava it says 25:42 at 3.7 miles. That is a minute/mile difference in pace (which I would gladly take) but not accurate. My theory is that Strava is deducting some of my “pause” time from the actual run time and also rounding up the distances. There are entire threads on the internet for this but PLEASE STRAVA, MAKE A GEAR S3 STANDALONE APP!
5) Split updates: I have noticed that you don’t get your split updates unless you have the watch screen active. This causes a couple issues. First of all it requires you to look at your watch around the mile marker which assumes you know about where a mile is. Or it assumes you are constantly checking your watch to see how far you have gone. Either way, if you do check “late” it will tell you your duration time is the time you are checking i.e. if you finished your mile at 8 minutes but didn’t check your split until 9 minutes, it will say your duration is 9 minutes. It will then go on to tell you your average mile time is 8 minutes, but it is a strange bug that could be fixed easily.
6) General fit: This is a big watch. I tighten the strap up one notch before taking off because I like a snug watch that doesn’t move around on my wrist. I still get a little bit of what I call “ulnar migration” where the watch kind of rotates towards the pinkie side of your wrist. I tightened even more which solved the issue but almost cut off the circulation to my hand and I could barely get the watch off afterwards. This is not a huge deal. I did take the band of my defunct RunIQ. This band is stretchier silicone and you can get it pretty tight. It seems to do the job. As of now, I'm swapping out the watch band on the days I run. Takes about 30 seconds once you get it down.
7) Pace: It is easy to scroll through your metrics: Duration, Distance, Heart Rate, Speed, Cadence etc. Pace, however is useless. It seems to be calculating an “instant pace” based on your speed in between GPS pings which can vary wildly. I would love to see an “average pace” and/or “split pace”. My old Garmin watch had on one screen: Duration, Distance and Average pace. That’s all I need, yet Samsung can’t quite get there.
8) Other stuff: Heart rate monitor I don’t use. I have heard it is horribly inaccurate especially when doing interval or split training. It seems fine for me for just general regular pace runs. I would not use this watch to train with heart rate zones. If you are doing this, you are probably hardcore and have a Garmin anyway. Another FYI is the default setting has “target coaching” enabled. When I did my first run, my watch buzzed every 10 seconds to tell me to “slow down” which just made me want to run faster and then just annoyed me. Just choose “basic workout”or turn coaching off if you don’t need reminders on pace/distance/time. Another small issue is that you have a choice of metric at the bottom of your screen when running, which is nice. What isn’t nice is that the default is heart rate and you have to change it for every run. I leave my screen on ‘duration’ and set the bottom at ‘distance’, it would be nice if the watch kept those setting.

This seems like a long list of things I don’t like, but honestly none of them are deal breakers and I have generally enjoyed using the watch. It has been a change from my Garmin 110 and I have had to alter the start of my runs to get good GPS signals but it’s worth the trade-offs. The music integration is very nice. It is easy to swipe over to see or change your music. The software is responsive and smooth (unlike the RunIQ). When you raise your wrist the watch wakes up and stats are pretty quick to update. I love being able to see your stats and map on your watch after a run records. Everything works like it should. I will also say that S-Health has updated a few times in the last couple months I have had the watch so you know Samsung is trying to constantly improve things. I see so much potential.  Improved GPS setting/locking, add average pace and some menu customizations, or just add a standalone Strava app and BOOM you are there.

Other watch functions: There isn’t much I can say here that hasn’t been said. This is a nice watch. It feels premium and well made. The rotating bezel is great. Tizen OS is slick and responsive and fairly easy to use. I took to it quickly after coming off using Android Wear for a couple months. The battery life is the best you will get on a dedicated smart watch. I routinely go 2-3 days even with Running with GPS/Music enabled. I have the ‘always on display’ feature off. The watch is very responsive when you raise it up and I prefer the improved battery life of the screen being off. The charger is great. You just drop the watch on the magnet and go. Takes about 2 hours from 0-100%. I love the built in sleep monitoring that feeds into S-Health.  I love having different choices for watch faces with different stats built in. I also love being at home away from my phone but still able to answer a phone call over the watch. I love the water resistance as I shower in it regularly with no issues. It is a great smartwatch. Now the only question is, do you believe in smart watches?

Overall watch concerns: People will mention that Tizen has a serious lack of app support compared to its Apple and Android competitors. Although this is true, I would like to address the overall nature of why you would wear a smartwatch. For me, I just want quick notifications. A quick text message, email, app notifications that I can see and dismiss without taking out my phone. Anything more than that, and I’m going to get my phone out. Writing a text message, phone. Checking nearby restaurants, phone. Getting directions to that restaurant, phone. Surfing my playlists to listen to, phone. Getting a detailed weather report, phone. Can you do all these things on the watch? Yes. But with my phone within reach it is faster and more efficient to do this on the phone. The exception would be if you have the LTE version and want to go sans phone. Even then, the core functionality and apps are there, but this is still not a replacement for a full smartphone. I have downloaded a few apps, but honestly I don’t use them. The core function of the watch is all built in and it works and works really well. There are a few areas that could improve though.
1) S voice: Very limited in what you can do, especially it seems with a non Samsung phone. I can respond to text messages with voice control, but can’t send off a new one. Also, when you use S-voice to respond to text message, it really seems to drain the battery. Overall, it is just not as good of a voice assistant as Google or Siri. I haven’t used it much, but I don’t care. Talking into a watch is weird anyway.
2) Spotify: Tizen doesn’t have many apps, but it does have Spotify, right? Check the reviews on this app though. It doesn’t work for many of us. There seems to be a bug that doesn’t allow you to connect it via Bluetooth to your phone for “remote” mode. I have gotten it to work a few times, but ended up just deleting the app. You can remote control your Spotify via the normal built in music app. Samsung did a press release that indicated Spotify will soon support “offline” playback allowing you to download songs onto the watch. I am eagerly awaiting this feature.
3) Connectivity issues: I think Samsung has been working on updates for this, as it seems better now. The watch is supposed to connect to a WiFi network if out of reach of your phone’s Bluetooth. There still seem to be some lags in this area. Sometimes it doesn’t connect to my WiFi. I have had to reset my watch occasionally to get back connected to Bluetooth. Also, there was one night where my watch drained it’s battery as I think it was on WiFi instead of Bluetooth. Again, this seems better now than a few months ago.

Overall Rating: It’s a great smartwatch. It’s an OK running watch. For me, it’s a nice compromise of the two. I get a good smartwatch that I can wear to work with my shirt and tie and still have a decent GPS watch for when I can get a run in. I’m hopeful for some improvements that would move this to a 5 star watch, but it works for what it is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_26?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=26&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you want heart rate monitoring, it's quite limited

Pros:
Great battery life.  Really good, 2 to 3 days with no charging, and effectively unlimited if you charge it daily while you're in the shower..
Great display. Bright, sharp, really outstanding.
Nice looking watch on its own.

Con:
The heart rate monitor is a disappointment.  Only works accurately if the watch is snugged down quite tight on your wrist, and only at rest.  Does not get a reading unless you are sitting still.  Will not monitor as you walk, let alone do anything active.  Reads up to 15 BPM high if you're still and the watch is worn comfortably.  Must be hard and tight against your wrist for an accurate reading.

Disappointing.  I liked it enough to wear it a few extra days before returning it hoping I could figure out a slution to the HR monitor issue.  Sadly, I wasn't able to resolve it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This is good news, as the most recent firmware update (post-June 2018), has fixed it, and the watch has now been restored to it's previously useful self. I waited 2 months following the failure of the APP (April 2018) to attempt to re-awaken this expensive instrument, and going to the Gear APP and downloading the most recent version was successful. I give Samsung 4 stars (instead of my previous 5), due to the fact that they failed to properly test the firmware updates prior to forcing distribution of the APP, and rendering the watch useless, and, taking an extensive amount of time to resolve it, without any option to revert to the previous version. Just in case you missed out on the interim of this APP, Samsung forced an upgrade onto the watch, which proceeded to open and close at will, every minute or so, which caused battery drain, and your phone notifications to constantly report the APP's flip-flopping with the Bluetooth, and somehow, pulling data from your phone's plan while doing all this. Now that it's fixed, The watch is fully functional again, and no further issues.....but, the APPs that were on the watch now need to be reloaded. At least it's working now, and it's really a great watch. Thanks Samsung Team, for fixing this issue, I really missed my watch those 3 months.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

SIMPSON","Extremely Low Battery Life Destroys an Otherwise Beautiful Watch","September 14, 2018","Unpacking the watch from the box, charging it, and exploring the great feature sets. At first glance, you believe this watch is everything the promo's hooked you on, and more!  The graphics are beautiful. It's loaded with features, watch faces, gps nav, music media, wannabe fitbit Samsung Health beautifully laid out... it has it all. But unless you place it in power saver mode, you will never get the 4 to 5 days of battery life they claim. Suddenly all those nice features you're bragging to your friends about have virtually disappeared!  In power saving mode, you are left with a digital watch face, month, date, battery indicator, and notification feature. Yep! It then becomes one of those watches you see at the checkout isle in just about any supermarket that you may pick up for your 12 year old for $9.95. Samsung has turned what could have been one of the top smart watches around into a battery draining joke. Oh, forgot to mention, if you select the features they recommend, the battery may last 10 to 12 hours. They also recommend this ridiculous 80/20 rule for charging to, and don't miss this, prevent the watch from overheating in the charge base! In other words, fully charge the watch, stopping at 80%, then hurry, hurry, hurry to place it on charge when it reaches 20%. At that point, you are living for your smart watch. I realize life is all about perspective, but...really!? Bad form Samsung, bad form! 3 stars just because I like the concept.

I purchased it to replace my MIO Fuse, which is one of the few good wrist HR monitors out there.
First thing I did was a 1-hour gym simultaneous monitoring to compare the charts (both using UA Record app). The results were very good:
same average as MIO Fuse. 1% difference in peak HR and 1% difference in calorie estimation. That is very good in my estimation.

Do not bash it for using Tizen instead of Android wear. Android for watches is TRASH, thank God it's Tizen. The integration with my Samsung S8 is seamless, and very customizable.

Fredenburg","Great watch...while it lasted","March 24, 2019","The watch performed admirably well while it lasted; purchased August 2017, died March 2019. The watch takes calls, plays music, relays messages and has an array of watch faces; all cool things. The battery life sucked, I got about 18 hours off a full charge if I shut off bluetooth, which is essential to the watch functioning. Moving my arm counted as steps, which is great and accelerates my workout.
The watch, for the $300 I spent, died an early death of unknown causes; halfway through my shift as a nurse the screen went black. I put it on a charger at home for three hours and tried rebooting the watch, but no luck. And while I'm not sure what the warranty is (I've owned it about 18 months) Samsung Technical support took forever (poor bastard tech must be working four calls with the lags in OUR conversation) I end up with a ticket to get to talk to someone else about repair options.
For the money, I'm thinking I might not...and might not replace with a Samsung. I bet there's a cheaper version of a smart watch or fitness tracker available, despite my love for the Samsung brand. Seems if they're not willing to stand behind the watch and get me an answer tonight (25 minutes primarily on hold with online tech just to get told I need to talk to SOMEONE ELSE) I might end up with a refurb Apple watch for less money, or some Google smartwatch, or just a regular $30 Timex.

Couldn't even reset it, it just kept showing the reboot screen. I sent it in again. It came back with a couple of things replaced. Again, it worked through the night and then went in the reboot loop. I sent it in a third time and this time they replaced two more parts but still, exactly the same thing happened. Worked through the night and then went in a reboot loop.

Sometimes it waits until it's almost full other times it will quit when it's still super low. I tried an online method of trying to get the battery to learn its range again but that hasn't seemed to work either. I have to remove and put it back on the charger to get it to start charging again. This is really frustrating bc I'll put it on the dock before bed and when I wake up it will only be at 20 or 30 percent.. not sure what the deal is
Update july 2018
I've had this watch quite awhile and I figured out the main reason for the flashing light.  I have a rubberized watch case on which allows it to charge but I think there is just enough space where sometimes it will error and cause that flashing and stop charging.  I also noticed it does it more frequently if I've been wearing the watch and put it on the charger immediately upon taking it off. Maybe it's due to it being much warmer on my body

Hoch","Amazing watch with a few minor quirks.","April 3, 2019","This is my first smartwatch and I couldn't be more pleased with it save for a couple of things that I feel could be improved.

I'll start with the feel of the watch. It feels expensive. My that I mean that it has weight to it. It's odd that people attribute weight to more value when it comes to products sometimes.

The band that came with this watch is a very soft rubber. It's probably going to be replaced soon though. It's a comfortable band and looks decent but I personally would like something that looks a little classier.

I'm not going to describe every app that is on this device but I do want to talk about one specifically that I don't care for. It's not really an app but more of a feature. It's one of the reasons that caused me to give this watch a slightly lower score.
S Voice. Personally, I don't like it. I've tried many times to make it work and use it, but it's just not good in my opinion. I tried to use it since I wanted to use all the features of the watch, and it just wouldn't cooperate. When it did respond to various commands, the voice was so bad and computerized that it was nearly impossible to understand. S Voice gives this great watch a knock down. :(

The only other knock on the watch is the battery. I charge it to 100% and b y the end of the day it's at about 50%. So really it could last for 2 days but I'd rather see it last for nearly a week. It's not horrible but I think they could do a little better.

Setup of the watch on my OnePlus 6T phone was easy. You're walked through every single step. Once it's up and running you have access to so many different watch faces (which I can't seem to get enough of) and a wide variety of apps.

All in all, it's a great watch that has a couple of things I don't care for. If you're in the market for a new watch I recommend the Samsung Gear S3 Frontier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Before buying this watch, I never wore watches, so I was worried how comfortable a big watch like this would feel. Admittedly. it took a couple weeks to get used to it.  It felt bulky at first, but it was worth it to ""break it in"".  I love being able to send/receive text messages, view email, and get other app notifications.  I love the customizable faces, the step count tracking, and being able to leave my phone in my purse and not have to dig it out to see what call or notification I'm receiving.

The only thing I wish it had was independent phone service.  It would be nice to have for tracking a run and being reachable without having to bring my phone.  The version I have doesn't have that.

Worth the value of $299.99 that i paid for.

Pros:
-feels nice on hand, not to heavy on the hand but not too light.
-swappable watch bands. Feeling leather straps no problem, maybe something for active wear too no problem.
-Decent ammount of good watch faces that are free. A cool one is the Fallout PipBoy.
-Samsung Pay is a blessing on this watch. No better feeling then not having to pull your wallet or phone out for a transaction.
-Nice built in dock charging station from the watch box itself.
-Can go almost 2 days on a full charge.

Cons:
-runs on the thicker side of smart watches if you do prefer something sleek like the Apple watches.
-price point being $299.99 at the time i bought it. (Worth it imo if you wear it everyday)
-Not alot of store apps, but theres still a handful of good apps built for the watch
-catches peoples attention if you're a shy person","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It is a beautiful watch, and it is very comfortable to wear. I love the features, and the many uses for it are great.  I especially like that i can text without using my hands with it, since you can wake up svoice by saying, ""hi gear"",  and then giving it a command. The apps are lacking on it, but what they do have seems to work quite well so far.

I only have two gripes with this watch though - one, the battery life stinks. With normal use of the watch (nothing too crazy), it needs to be charged at the end of the day every day. That's with just looking at it very seldomly, but it still dies quick. The claim of 4 days that is made is if it's in power saver mode, but then it's only got basic functions, with no heart rate monitor, blue tooth, or wifi capability. If i wanted a basic watch like that, i would have gotten a cheaper watch or something. This is my major issue with the watch.

Secondly, and this isn't as bad, the voice recognition is a bit bad when talking into it. That's not too big of a deal though, since it gets the right word about 80% of the time. Not bad, but still not too good. I can live with that though.

Overall, i would still recommend this watch to everyone. I'm going to see what i can do to extend the battery life by more than it is now, but for now, that is my only concern with this watch. The features are more than enough to get a 5 star from me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This fixes a software issue that causes rapid battery drain.

PROS:
+This is one tough watch
+2+ days of battery life
+Ergonomic (And that's from an apple user)
+Blazing Fast
+Unique and very cool watch faces
+Calls can be accepted and made from the Frontier on IOS

CONS:
-No replying to notifications (Curse you apple)
-S Voice sounds like a really bad Sci Fi robot

I traded in my apple watch for the frontier, and in all senses of the word do i mean, IT IS BETTER.

The Frontier feels rugged and looks professional, unlike the apple watch that feels flimsy (as apple products are) and just looks like a microchip with a screen.

If you want intuitive design and a rugged watch that won't let you down, i suggest the Frontier.

I haven't had any problems getting phone notifications on the watch, using Galaxy S7 and OnePlus 6. Timed ""do not disturb"" works. Decent watch face options.

Samsung apps are garbage. Things just don't work, and the apps really aren't that user-friendly. I don't even use the Samsung Health app because it won't sync to my watch using my OnePlus 6. Samsung Pay regularly deletes my credit card info - stopped using that. Also, my non-Samsung phone fails to push an update to my watch.

Fitness/health tracking is bad. It can't read my heart rate most of the time. Step tracking is good - as long as you move your arms when you walk. Sleep tracking is off by more than just a few minutes.

Alarms don't go off every so often. I'm not the only one with this problem. I've set multiple alarms one night to wake up an hour after the last one was supposed to go off. NOT GOOD.

A watch for this price by a brand as big as Samsung should have better support, less bugs, and better apps.

But it does make a great accessory to your smartphone making for a more convenient lifestyle (luxury over necessity).

* This can make for a great replacement flip phone (with LTE) with basic apps included. Just note that the screen size may be smaller for elderly/those far sighted, but the contact icons are really large. If you plan just to receive and send phone calls; this is a good option to consider as this is on your person most of the time. You do need a smart device (phone/tablet) to setup.

Let's go through some notable features:

1. App notifications

Can get app notifications for ANY app, not just selected/popular ones. You can also hand select which app you want to notifications for.

Watch will vibrate signaling an app notification. Vibration is not really strong (even at highest setting) as if you're doing intense physical activity and/or heavily focused on a task you may not notice it. This can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. But there is a light orange dot indicator on your clock face giving you a visual indicator that you do have notifications

Notification displayed is the same as one your home screen on your phone.

You can interact with some such as e-mail or text. There's no full keyboard, but you can text via speech, old fashion number texting (like on flip phones), hand write/swipe in individual letters, or use suggested text response.

For other notifications that doesn't require text like my security cam motion detection for example; you can double tap the notification on the watch and when you open your smart phone, the app will automatically open up.

For some apps; if you have multiple notifications, you may or may not be able to see all of them at once. Some allow you to only see the most recent one. But again, there's a option to double tap on the screen to open the app on your phone.

2. SOS function
Have to set this up on your phone app to activate on the watch

Basically sends a SOS message with GPS loctation to a person on your emergency contact or 911 if you choose

Good if you're ever in a hostage situation or stuck in a natural disaster for example

To activate you have to do a quick triple tap on the home button, which then the screen promps a 5second countdown timer just in case you activate it by accident. It then dials the emergency contact where it automatically puts you on speaker phone on the lowest possible volume (have to hold up watch to your ear to hear them) just in case you're in a hostage situation and don't want anyone is close proximity to hear. The feature also can send a generic text message and GPS location to your emergency contact if you wish

3. Alarms
Can have a sound and/or vibration alarm.

The latter is very convenient if you have someone in the same bed and/or room with you and have to wake up before them, but don't want to wake them up.

Again the rumble on the watch is not very strong, but with alarm it's continuous for maybe 30secs. If you're a heavy sleeper or your skin a not very sensitive to touch then you may want to set sound based alarm also. I recommend you test out the alarm on a day you have off (from school and/or work) or have a sound based alarm go off 5-10mins after the vibration alarm to test it.

Alarm is not linked to your phone's alarm unfortunately. So they won't both go off the same time as they're considered separate apps

4. Health Fitness App
Have a fully featured fitness/health application similar to Fitbit and other fitness trackers.

Tracks your sleep and physical activity.

Like other fitness watches, the heart rate monitor is not as accurate as the chest strap on, but does give you a rough estimate. May not accurately (down to the exact numbers) tell you your heart rate in real time, but will give you a nice trending graph to track overtime.

If you have friends who also use the watch/app you can compare stats, which is a great fitness motivator

App also gives you notifications if it notices you've been sedentary for a few hours and will prompt you to do simple stretching exercises. You can turn this off also if this bothers you.

5. Phone calls
Gives you large contact icons to tap on once you set them up as favorites/frequently used on your watch.

Very convenient as you don't have to pull out your phone.

Goes directly to speaker phone on your watch. Good if you're driving, busy doing a project where you are not hands free or have place to put your phone down for speaker phone**.

**Don't have to worry about misplacing your phone or carrying it around if you have to walk from place-to-place.

Depending on where you pick up the call is where the phone signal will go: example phone directly, watch or bluetooth headset.

6. Phone Watch Finder

You can find your phone via the watch and vice vera.

Assuming both have some battery life left, bluetooth is on both devices.

If phone set to vibrate will still make a sound.

7. Apps

Apps are very limited compared to the Google Play Store and Smart Phone/Tablet apps.

Most are just watch faces.

There are some decent apps such as a Basic Calculator, Discount Calculator, Weather app, youtube app, music player, flash light, calendar, to-do list, yelp, news headlines, etc

For video apps it crops the videos, and drains tons of battery.

You can store up to 4gb music into the watch

There's very limited support at the moment and there's no killer app except maybe the pre-installed health app at the moment. Wish there was a GPS turn-by-turn navigation app

You make purchases via Samsung Store, and not the Google Play store. So if you don't have one, you have to make an account to download even the free apps. If you have Google Play credit you can't use them to make watch app purchases. The store is also not user friendly when trying to find apps, and will take some searching to find the hidden gem or app that fits your needs

8. Samsung Pay

Very easy to setup. Have to download multiple apps on your phone which syncs together.

Have to go through this e-mail verification process with your bank

Setup takes no longer than 10mins for multiple cards

In practice makes shopping a breeze as you don't have to take anything out from your pockets. Just hold on the back button to quick access Samsung pay, select the card you wish to use, press 'pay', then tap on the console at the register.

Supports MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission). It'll simulate a card swipe. Not to be confused with NFC. If the cashier says Samsung pay/Apple Pay doesn't work, it will still work. Only exception is if the card reader is insert (card) only instead of swipe.

---Misc info

-Build Quality
Very good. Has a heft to it, but won't weigh your hand down. You will get used to it, as it is comfortable to wear throughout the day

The watch is very large, at around 2 inches diameter.

Has a rugged design. Looks better one males than females in my opinion due to the size. For those who are smaller/thinner profile, may want to look into the Gear S2. Just note that it's a previous gen model and has less RAM

If you wear long sleeve shirts, sweater, jacket, etc;  it will snag at the cuff

As thick as standard smart phone nowadays with thin case on. So will protrude a bit off your wrist.

It's dust, water, rain and shock resistant. The manual states it's not recommended to take showers or swim with it though. But is sturdy enough for some extreme situations if there would be any, just don't abuse it on a daily basis

Love the twist navigation feature. Has a round circular basil around the watch face, Way better than using a small twist knob on the side or touch screen only.

--Display
Very vibrant. Similar quality to most high end smart phones.

Very easy to view compared to other smart watches, again due to it's size.

--Battery life
Very good. Can last a couple of days depending on usages, and if you use the always on watch face display.

My average with watch face not always on is about 2-2.5 days

Charges wirelessly via stand. No need to align any pins, just plop it in and it'll automatically charges. Can get full charge from 10% battery life within 2.5 hours

--Less time taking things out of your pockets
Don't have to pull out my phone/wallet as much. Great for work when you want to be discrete about cell phone usage. Also good for gym use/ outdoor jogging. For commuting in a busy bus/train, don't have to worry about elbowing someone to get to your phone.

Overall opinion, nice phone companion. Very good if you have a busy lifestyle and/or if shaving off seconds throughout the day is a big deal for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

* Easy access to relevant data

It's the perfect watch for someone who may want their watch to look classy at work but not too flashy off the clock. It's universal, it works well with any style. Whether you're roughing the outdoors in feet of snow or coming into an important business meeting, it makes a statement.

Practicality: ""Do I need this?"" I asked myself every time I passed one at a store, saw an ad, or it happened to pop up on Amazon. The answer; yes I do. This has been a game-changer at work and home. As a teacher, my phone is always going off from group texts with other teachers, administrators, parents, advisory members, and more. This allows me to keep in the loop without whipping my phone out in front of my students. I can also use the bevel to quickly contact teachers during plan periods across the building or out of the building to save myself both the walk and the time. It's perfect in all weather conditions. Is it below zero outside and you're bundled up and have a thick pair of gloves on? That's fine, just use the dial or go into your settings and adjust the sensitivity. Is it raining? Still works, and it's water resistant. Two of the biggest features: Find My Phone; for those of you who forget where it is or perhaps it slipped in between the couch cushions and you've looked everywhere else. Second; The silent alarm. You can set alarms that vibrate only so if you want to catch a quick siesta and not oversleep, it's perfect. Not to mention if you have a busy schedule but don't want to have a ringtone going off or to wiggle your phone out of your pocket in the middle of talking to someone, it delivers a discreet vibration that with a simple swipe can be dismissed.

Battery: I haven't charged my watch in almost 3 days and it's at 50% now. The charging dock is wireless, and it can only be charged wirelessly so it's more water resistant. Aside from how fast the watch charges, the dock works as a bedside clock if you don't wear it to bed.

Health: I walk a lot, more than I thought I already did. This watch has surprisingly encouraged me to walk more by syncing it up to my Samsung Health app and competing with friends and in global challenges. The heart rate monitor is also a wonderful feature. Whenever I measured it on my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge I felt like I should see a doctor about having a heart condition because it was always 90-100 when I read it. However it turns out my heart rate is 50-70 resting and 80-100 when I'm busy at work.

Other hidden features: I added a dog toy squeak sound as a widget on my phone. Why? Because my dog doesn't always come when I call his name. So I just twist the bevel, tap the play button, and he comes running up to me every time. The uses for the Gear S3 are only limited by your imagination.

Customization: The number of free watch faces seems unlimited. I spent 3 days looking through watch faces trying to decide which one I liked most. The wrist band is interchangeable and Amazon carries all kinds from plastic to leather to metal. It's easy to change and they're very secure.

Is it really water resistant?: YES! You can dip your hand into a kitchen sink filled with water and there will be no effect done to the watch. Gone are the days of burying electronics in rice.

My only con: I wish there were more compatible apps, however, it seems like each day there are a treasure trove of new apps I see that can work with the Gear S3, for now it has everything I need. Though teaching app design to my students, I am a person who loves to go through and test out every app I can.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Recent software issues have brought battery life down to just a few hours a day of use before Low Battery warnings and shift to limited functionality imposed in its conservation mode.  Samsung Pay has only worked a few times and you look silly waving your watch near card readers when people are waiting in line.  It is much faster to pull out a credit card.  My watch is just a year old and watch batteries should last longer than that.

Update 2/8/2019:  Completely died.  Now won't hold a charge more than 20 min.  Did all the maintenance with factory resets, rebooting, new software updates, but nothin works.  This watch didn't last even 1 year without major problems and now is dead.  I have watches I bought back in the '60's that still work so this is just a sign that Samsung should stick to making cellphones and refrigerators.

It drove me nuts. I sent this back.  If you are getting one of these, get the LTE version so that you can leave your phone at home and just use your watch.

Plus, support staff was useless, didn't know the product well enough to know how to get the serial number, initially told me I couldn't get service since I didn't keep the box (!), and only pressure from my side got the guy to figure out the key combination to get the serial. In any case, even if they fix it I won't change this review to more than 3 stars, given that this is a brand new product that is malfunctioning.

(Despite it's limitations) Read lots of reviews, and did buy another watch before this one, and returned it due to locking up etc. I factory reset that watch 5 times before giving up and sending it back. I've had NO problems with this watch, and was reluctant to switch from Wear OS to Tizen which is why I just didn't buy this one in the first place. Now? I'm very glad I did. Tizen might not have to largest app store, but what's there works really well. I have no regrets now of dumping Wear OS, despite a few paid apps I lost. The watch itself is very fast, no hesitation, few hiccups with connections or anything else. Also, and one of the best things, is my old ""range anxiety"" (Like having an electric car) is just nonexistent now.  After 12 hours, I typically have 60% or better battery despite running AOD all the time. (Always On Display) If I wear it overnight and turn the brightness down to 2, and turn off the AOD, it will track my sleep and lose only about 3% battery overnight. I use Watchmaker, and two of my designs are pictured. (Search for Ueltzen in the Watchmaker app, my designs are all free) That Watchmaker app is one that kept crashing the other watch I sent back. (Never a problem on my Huawei or Zenwatch) The best thing about this watch is the MST that the new Galaxy (And most other watches) lacks because Samsung decided to remove it from the new version. I can walk up to ANY card reader terminal, even ones at gas station marts in tiny backwoods towns, where the clerk swears ""It ain't gonna work!"" and before they can finish the sentence, the reader beeps, and I enter my PIN and out comes a receipt. I even used it at a Walmart where I'd left my wallet in the console of the Jeep, and paid with the watch itself, you do NOT have to be near the phone for the Samsung Pay to work! Few clerks or cashiers have seen it before I use it, so it gets a LOT of comments.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm glad I waited to get the Gear S3 Frontier now that the Galaxy watch came out (heavily discounted). It has much the same functionality as the Galaxy watch except being swim-capable. I don't swim anyway, so it's no big loss. It's full of apps and the sound quality isn't that bad. I made a call on it already and it sounded decent. The voice recognition software on it is a bit sluggish and doesn't always get what you're saying, but I suppose I'll have to toy with it some more to learn the bugs. The vibration is very strong and the volume is loud enough to wake you from a solid sleep. It took me about 20 minutes to fully set it up before I could start customizing and using it (downloading updates, etc.). But, it was extremely easy to pair and set up. It came with a 30% charge already and took less than 45 minutes to fully charge on the supplied wireless charger.

I have a google pixel 3, and with the old version of the app everything worked just fine, I already had 3 gear watches. The current app that they can't seem to fix gives a blank white screen when you tap to sign into your gear account, and without the gear account being connected, you can't update apps, get any new watch faces get notifications properly or do most of the smart functions you want to work when you spend hundreds of dollars on a watch. I happened to buy two new watches, this gear sport and the new gear watch 46mm. After the tech people on the phone were done with me, not only did the new phones not connect, they had me reset all my other watches, so now I have 5 watches that don't function because they can't fix the app. UNLESS YOU HAVE A SAMSUNG PHONE TO USE WITH IT, DON'T BUY ANY GEAR WATCHES, YOU WILL BE VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED. Samsung should be letting people know, and letting sellers know that they have this problem and have know since at least October of 2018 going by the threads I have found of other people complaining about the problem. I wondered why the prices had dropped so much on these watches, they are great when the app works, without the app there is nothing smart about them, they are just a watch. As far as I am concerned, they are defrauding people buy continuing to sell theses watches and not telling people the smart functions won't work. They had me download and send them log files from my phone and the watches and then I never hear from them again, they have no idea how to fix the problem and screw up peoples phones and watches playing tech support like they do.

The super AMOLED screen is simply beautiful and works well even in low light conditions.There is a huge selection of watch faces via the gear app to customize the watch even further.I have read reviews saying that there is not enough app support from Samsung , for me that's really not a problem since I mostly use the watch for notifications , fitness and payments.
The best feature is the Samsung pay which works on non NFC terminals by using MST technology making it far more useful than Android Pay of Apple Pay.

My only issue is the original watch strap that the watch came with , it sticks to the skins if your sweating while working out and that can be little irritating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Love it! I have done comparisons on the Gear heart rate monitor compared to my Suunto heart rate monitor and they are almost exact. Sometimes they read same and other times they are off 1 beat/min. I have compared the steps taken on my Gear with my wife and daughters fit bit and we are fairly close. I'm taller so I have less steps, but its really close. I have been swimming with the Gear on and haven't had any issues. This watch is highly recommended. Oh, the battery was draining fast at first (lasting just under a day). I performed a factory restore with updates and now I get 2.5-3 days.  The new software updates fixed a lot of issues I see reported in older reviews, so keep that in mind.

Add in my reminders & calendar and it is a solid smartwatch. The ability to answer the phone when it is in a pocket/another room whatever, is ultra cool.

Battery: 2 days, easy. On business trips if I forget the charger I can put it in low power mode overnight and it will last several days.

Performance is splendid - Tizen is stable, fast, no lag and I love the bezel for controlling the watch. Way more accessible than Android wear.

Great fitness tracker. finally a watch that has decent heart rate tracking - actually useful - and GPS so it is great for bike rides & running. When I go out & garden or take a walk it will automatically detect activity, so more than just steps, it records activities AND floors climbed, so you can see how active you were throughout the day or week.

Apps: I never used many with Wear, and here I have what I need: Contacts, calendar, fitness, time & date, answering the phone. Has Spotify, and I can move my podcasts here easily (as mp3), though I would like a featured podcast manager.

Android Pay with the phone was a PITA, using Samsung pay with the watch is 1) way faster/trouble free and 2) works at far more places than Android or Apple pay.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Was like new.","September 28, 2019","I was a bit hesitant when I purchased this. I purchased it ""used"" here from Amazon. In the end, I bought it used because it was sold by, and shipped by, Amazon. I have yet to have a problem with Amazon standing behind anything. It said, that being used, it could have blemishes, could be in non-original packaging, etc.

I'm sure mileage varies, but I scored!! Other than I could tell the package had been opened and re-taped, it looked brand, spanking, new and in perfect condition!!

As a watch, it's OK. It isn't as useful as I had hoped for handling notes, lists, etc. because the screen is so small. And (there may be a way to fix this, but I haven't found it) it is quite annoying if I cross my arms across the face of the watch. It detects it as a ""long press"", and will often change the watch face!!

It is also a bit annoying if you use a lot of non-Samsung apps. Unless those apps come with a widget for the watch, you might as well not have the watch. For example, I have for years used an alternative text messaging app. Once I got this watch, I had to switch back to the default message app for it to interface with the watch.

I still give it full stars because it does exactly what it claims to do. It isn't the fault of the watch that my favorite apps don't offer watch widgets.

I'd still like to find a way to stop that arm crossing long-press problem, though.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

First off, I wanted to like the Gear S2 that came out last year, but some expectations fell flat and I knew the second generation would be worth the wait. Boy was I right!
First off, Style, The Frontier has the rugged mans looking watch that the Classic and Sport didn't offer. I love the way it looks, and there were plenty of watch faces to choose from (I love the one with glowing green luminescent look). The band although easily replaced, looks fine and seems durable.
Battery Life, Charging this watch on every 3rd night before I go to bed. I like to wear it as much as possible to track sleep, and fitness goals. It seems to me that the watch starts to adjust to your ""pace"" and activity rate to improve accuracy as time goes on. My settings are for watch to be on when I look at it and I dialed down the brightness a tad.
Functionality, I've got this paired with a Samsung Note Edge (a great discontinued phone I hope I never part with), and it's a quite large phone, so having not to pull it out of my pocket every time I get a text, email or a call (from spammers)is a dream come true. I have taken calls on it and all though a little nerdy talking into a watch, the speaker works great and people on the other end hear me quite clearly as long as the bluetooth connection is strong. One time when I had my bluetooth headphones on , I took a call and it went to the watch instead of the headphones. Cycling the power on the bluetooth headphone seemed to transfer it over, but I need to understand how to make it go to the headphones when they are paired.
Notifications are programmable through an APP that you download from the Play Store, so you can turn on or off any notification that originates from the phone. The vibration is just enough to let you know something came in. I believe you can also choose which notification lights the face or just buzzes the watch.
Fitness , I have been a big fan of my Garmin Vivofit for almost 2 years, it as helped me lose weight and stay active. The steps on the Garmin tend to be higher than the watch, but it may be that my stride is not calibrated on the Vivofit. But let's face it, if you shoot for 10,000 steps a day, a few hundred off is irrelevant . Now the Gear actually ""talks"" to you with notifications, like ""get moving"" ""stretch"" and and gives you nice little notifications when you've met your activity or step goal. Heart rate monitor is better than I expected since I have the strap for my Garmin and found that and the watch to be on par with the HR monitor on the treadmill. Wearing the watch tight on your wrist will yield better results. There are some cute apps like USA Today that will tell you the top stories, but to read them, you have to open your phone, which is fine. The watch as the ability to control your music on your phone ( I use rocket player) and there's an app to remotely fire your camera phone from the watch, I'm a photographer, and that's just pretty cool to take stealth photos..Well ""Lucy"" as a reference to the  Android movie with Scarlett Johansson is what I call her, and she's telling me to ""Get Moving"" (who am I to argue with SJ?) So I gotta run..or walk.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_31?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=31&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I really wanted an activity tracker that didn't look like an activity tracker.  It's easy to understand, you can move apps around on the watch, and download apps to it.  I really like the charging station, because it charges the watch vertically on a stand.  My only complaint, and the reason I can't give it 5 stars, is that if you install extra watch faces, that are default faces, it'll be okay at first, then suddenly your watch will go from 100% to 0% in 24 hrs.  In researching the issue, it seems like it's a common one, and Samsung is likely aware of it, and hopefully it's fixed in the Gear S4.  While not a huge inconvenience, as their are plenty of default faces to choose from, it's still disappointing to find a face you really like, then have to get rid of it because it drains your battery.  This issue certainly wouldn't have stopped me from purchasing the watch.  I also have Samsung Health installed and love the tracking it does for me, makes things easy.  Overall, it really is a great watch, and I'm very happy that I decided to purchase it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I got this watch replace my Samsung Gear S, I think one of the first generation of smart watches. Basically, that was a extension of the phone. I could answer calls, but neither hear nor talk to the person.
This watch has a built in speaker and microphone, so I've actually heard people talk on the watch, although I still haven't confirmed that it actually works as a second phone - Dick Tracy style (or James Bond, depending on which one you remember).

This watch charges very quickly on the charging pad, and holds its change too. I've lefty it out for three days, it still had 16% left. On an average day, the charge goes to about 80% on a full charge.
The weather functions are an impressive upgrade, although I haven't verified the accuracy of the tools. It appears that some of the tools - altimeter, barometer among them - need a reference to be really effective, but i haven't tested that yet. It looks pretty accurate compared to available data even without the reference.
The health functions are amazing - not only does this watch measure heartbeats accurately and frequently, it does a fair job predicting your current activity - walking, running, biking. I haven't tried swimming with it yet, but I think that's an option - I wouldn't do it without some protection however. The one annoying part of this is that it will prompt you (unless you change the notification settings) to start walking if you're stationary for a long time - not exactly a good idea of you're sitting in a meeting. It will also buzz if you're walking around at work, just a casual reminder that you're also exercising.
As a timekeeper, it's pretty good. Oddly, with all of the fancy apps on this thing (you can download more through the gear os on your phone), a good free chronometer is hard to find. Nonetheless, it does its primary job very competently.
I'm hopeful that with updates, this watch will keep getting better and smarter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It seems to hold a charge for at least 2 days, and probably 3-4 if you use lower-energy settings.

In the end, this is about two things: (1) a watch, and (2) a fitness aid.  This watch does a great job at both of those.

There are lots if nifty features that give it phone-like capabilities (through Bluetooth to your phone, you can make calls, get/send emails/texts).  But I've found I don't really need those.  Nor do I need many of the other extras (games, news, etc).  I just don't want to have my phone be yet another place that I look for that stuff, or yet another place that is beeping at me.

NOTE: Some Samsung Gear S3 watches have full cellular capabilities - they can handle calls, emails and texts even without a Bluetooth connection to your phone.  This unit does NOT have that capability.  Be sure you're buying the right watch!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_44?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=44&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I love the way the watch looks. Feels sturdy. I have had no issue with the bezel feeling loose like other reviews state. Size is perfect as I dont like small watches but i dont like overly large ones either. The strap it comes with is OK. But I am upgrading as it sweats a lot during workouts.

Functionality wise it's hit or miss for me. The motion function to turn the face on works 80% of the time. I have found myself having to repeat the motion a few times in the 4 days I have worn it. The always on mode does not work for me at all. at first i thought i had a faulty watch. i looked it up online and several people have had the same issue if they have tattoos. I cant grasp why an always on function would be impacted by ink. So I had my wife wear it and it works just fine on her.
Pulse is hit or miss. I'd say it works 50% of the time. on the first try it works about 25% of the time. most times i either have to adjust the watch and try several times or i just give up. This makes a little more sense as far as tattoos impacting it.
Alerts work perfect. battery life is awesome. the charger it comes with works great. the face options are awesome too. you can download a ton.

samsung tech support is HORRID! when i called about the always on issue it took me a while for them to even understand what always on was. I thought maybe i got a new guy on. so i hung up and called back again. same thing. i had to tell them what people were saying on their own boards about the tattoo issues. a quick google search pulls up several threads.... how are you, as the maker, not going to know about a known issue? she had to escalate and said i would get an email confirming that she elevated. never got it. ill wait a few weeks and call back.

I think i will still keep the watch regardless of its issues/its issues bc of my tattoos. overall its a nice watch. i dont know if im too lenient bc its my first or if most smart watches have their own issues. but overall i am ok with spending $300 on something nice w/ some problems.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_39?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=39&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This has some great features, such as offline spotify playback which is nice because you don't need to carry your phone or have a network connection. However, the watch itself irritated my wrist while running, felt heavy and the GPS did not work properly. If you are not using it for exercise, this may be the watch for you.

However, for some unknown reason, the battery life, which was 3+ days, has gone down to about 8 hours.  I haven't downloaded any apps or changed the settings I have been using for the past month; the only change has been some sort of software update.

I'm giving a temporary 3-stars in hopes that I can figure out a solution.  If I can, I'll bring this up to 5-stars.  If I can't, I'll lower this to 1-star and return it.  Either way, once I figure out what I'm going to do, I'll provide better feedback with what I like and dislike, etc....
====
Update:  So, after the watch completely discharged its battery, and I let it fully charge again, I'm back to a full 3 days of use.  The only setting I changed after it charged was turning the 'connections -> wifi' from 'auto' to 'off'.  I figure I almost always have my phone, and if I don't, I'm probably not near an open access point WITHOUT a captive portal (requiring browser-based login).  That doesn't necessarily explain the battery drain because this was how I had the setting previously.

This is a great watch, based on what I was looking for.  I previously had an LG G watch, one of those goofy-ass rectangular smartwatches, and other than the style, i really liked the functionality.  I like the style of many new round smartwatches, but they were either prohibitively expensive (Tag Heuer), or the battery life was crap (most smartwatches), or, in the case of the LG Watch Sport and Style, you either got more than you wanted and paid for it, or not enough.

My criteria:
Looks (subjective, but essentially, a round smartwatch that wasn't too bulky, but with a screen big enough to use)
Functionality (had to work with a non-Samsung Android smartwatch, show notifications from hangouts, SMS, calendar, etc)
Battery Life (had to very easily make it through 24 hours)
Non-LTE version

I think the watch looks great.  I'm a bigger dude, so the watch doesn't look out of place and huge on my wrist like some of the other photos I've seen.  If you have svelte features, maybe the size would be problematic.  I'm using the standard band that comes with the watch, which looks good, but I like that I can easily switch bands if I want to.

Functionally, the watch is great.  I get notifications from SMS and Hangouts, as well as from Google calendar, which I use at work for upcoming meetings.  Initially, as I was researching the watch, I wasn't sure if a non-Samsung watch would pair well with this, since it doesn't run Android Wear (it runs Samsung's Tizen OS).  The only issue with regard to Tizen is the lack of apps, but I don't really care about extending the capabilities beyond what it already does (wihch is what I need/want).  The watch has decent sensors for 'exercise', though I suspect there are superior watches for that.  I don't exercise that much and don't care about measuring my heart-rate anyway.  I can feel my heart about to explode out of my chest when I play hockey, which is a good enough indicator that I'm getting some exercise.

Battery life is awesome.  I'm currently on my third day since its last charge, and other than the weird drain issue I first wrote about, the watch has been solid.  I do currently have wifi off, as well as location, since I usually have my cell phone nearby; the watch gets that info from the phone.  Knowing I can turn either of those on, if I needed to, is nice.  I also have my watch face set to only turn on when I move my wrist or push a button.  I've read that keeping the display always-on would reduce battery quite a bit.  Good thing I'm not always looking at the watch face.

Bonus features!
Samsung Pay.  I never used Android pay (NFC) for purchases.  I was sort of waiting until it was more ubiquitous and expected, as opposed to everyone looking at you like 'one of those types'.  That's just my own insecurity though.  But with this watch, I just press a button, select a card, and then hold the watch near the card-paying-thingie (NFC terminal) at the store.  That's great and all, but what's really super great is that it doesn't have to be an NFC terminal.  As long as it's got the magnetic strip, this watch will work!  I tried it at a local liquor store and the woman said, ""this device is really old and doesn't have that fancy technology.""  I replied, ""this watch is magic, check this out!"".  We were both pretty impressed.

Another feature I really like is how you can reply to messages.  There is an old phone style keyboard, with 2-3 letter per number, which is just terrible.  There is the ability to speak into the watch, which I don't use because nothing comes close to Google's speech recognition, in my option.  And the other option is to draw the letters on the screen.  I wasn't sure how well that would work; it works great!  Just draw each letter, quickly, if you want, with an underscore for a 'space', and then send.  Love it.

Finally, Dick Tracy, you can answer phone calls through your watch.  Just speak into it.  I haven't really used this, and figure I will never use it unless I'm tied to a shark, which is tied to a missile, or maybe if I'm driving (I don't have Bluetooth in my car).  But it's cool.

Anyway, this is a good watch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After deicing which phone of mine I should use primarily (Pixel 3XL or Iphone X Max) I decided on the Pixel 3 XL. But....what watch? Finding a replacement that meets the features of the Apple Watch is no easy task. If I could use my apple watch on the pixel, I would!

So, I had a older model LG watch which is just ok. The battery life is dismal with minimum use and barely makes it a day. So, I took a chance with the well reviewed Samsung Galaxy S3. I could have waited for the new ones to come up this fall, but they removed the bezel, which to me is a strong selling point.

I got my S3 and put it to the test. It's big, but yet thin. It doesn't have that Oreo Cooking thickness sitting on my wrist. The colors and clarity are great, and the watch just feels like it was built with quality.

So, how does it compare to the Apple Watch? I would say it is just as good, but in a sightly different way. Getting used to a round face vs. square and larger on my wrist won't be a big deal. The notifications are great. What I like with Samsung is that I can actually change the notification tones on the watch. There are several short tones to choose from that make sure you hear it, but it's not obnoxious.

The Bezel! Best way to navigate a watch. It's fluid, yet precise, so your not going past the screen you want. THe locations of the notifications are to the left, and the widgets to the right.

Battery! Holy Cr@p! 2 day's of use including monitoring my sleep last night, and it's only down to 63%. That beats the battery on the Apple Watch.

Apps: Not as robust as Apple or Wear OS. There are plenty of apps, but Where is the Dark Sky App?

Summary: If you want a watch that lasts a very long time and does the job, this is it.  It takes a lot to impress me, and this watch did. Check out my picture and watch face. Sorry for my hairy arm. Cheers!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, make sure you buy other wrist straps","March 10, 2018","I love this watch! The  Frontier looks so nice and is very robust. I'm a bit clumsy so i have smacked my watch against various surfaces pretty hard and i have yet to scratch this thing! The rotating bevel is very satisfying and the watch has so many features on the gear app store.

Other Pros:
- Customization! you can choose any watch face that you like. Want roman numerals instead of numbers? Just select that watch face!
- Battery Life. I thought this would require charging every few hours but i have gone two whole days without charging.
- Applications. Choose from Fitness apps that measure your heart rate to Utility apps like google maps to games like retro tetris.
- Comfortable. This watch really is comfortable to wear. The wrist strap is OK until you get moisture between your wrist and strap.

I do not have the watch always on and i wear this watch while sleeping. The built in sleeping app is pretty accurate and the heart rate is also very accurate. I have gone up a few flights of stairs and the steps/floor counter was pretty much spot on.

My only con is the wrist strap. its a rubber strap and  if you get any moisture between your strap and your wrist you may experience some chaffing due to the rubber and moisture. However, this is easily resolved by buying another wrist strap.

Great buy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It doesn't fit well in the charger even though you think it does. I find that it doesn't charge half the time. You cannot change various security settings! There is no way to get around entering a pin once you have enabled this feature so every time I put it on I have to enter the pin. Then if I do not put it on very tight on my wrist it comes lose and I end up having to enter the pin NUMEROUS times each day.

For those who already did some research... This review is focus on specific details... overall it is a 4.2 out of 5 stars product. I like it and enjoy the flexibility that it brings. You can read most of your notifications and for fitness works fine, very nice battery durability and it is useful in many ways as they say in the reviews. Spotify is a plus for the premium users, since you can download the songs and play it without having your phone around or connected to the internet.

My point of view, it is a great product, and the OS itself is not bad, the thing is that they are still working on getting it up to date in comparison with the other OSs. To be more specific there are many apps that stop working because of the last update, Whatsapp and Tizen OS are still working on the support of the app, In my opinion they might be thinking on been a closed environment like apple (however they became popular because of their open environment with Android).

Quick","Great watch, lots of features","January 21, 2017","Great watch, lots of features.  It is a little on the bigger side, so if you have smaller wrists it might be a little oversized.

Pros:
- Great battery life, I just tested it and made to right at 4 days from full charge to 9%, I was not using gps, but had several hour + workouts using live  heart rate monitoring.
- Very good look and feel.  The stainless case and rotating bezel give a really professional, rugged, and classy look to it.  easy to wear in all situations
- Heart rate monitoring.  I actually have had really good luck with the live heart rate monitoring.  keep it tight and off your wrist bone and it picks up fine.
- It can be used with Android or Apple phones.

Cons:
- I have a Galaxy S6 Edge Plus and the Frontier links to it via bluetooth.  The bluetooth being on cuts my battery life in half pretty easily, so while the watches battery is great, it does impact my phone significantly.  If i disconnect it from my phone, then it does lose the notification function when receiving texts/calls.
- It's monitors your sleep patterns, but you have to go through several steps to turn off the notifications, or the wake up gesture before you go to sleep, other wise it lights up in your face all the time.  and regardless what you do if you turn the bezel it still lights up, so kind of annoying.
- S Health app, the main app that tracks all your health and biometrics is a pretty solid app, but it seems to be geared toward the runner/cyclist, which i'm not.  I do a lot of weight lifting and some cardio.  There isn't a real good app for just pulling live heart rate continuously and measuring calorie burn with our constant suggestions to move more or go faster.  (pretty minor, but still a nuisance)
- It can get wet, but it's not recommended to swim with it on.  They do not recommend salt or fresh water swimming, but it is capable of being submerged.

Overall it's a great product, and while a little pricey it's cheaper than a comparable non-smartwatch with similar design.

I've avoided digital watches in favor of quartz and automatic watches with good old analog time-telling capabilities.  ""I've no need to digitize my life any further,"" said the man.  And I have turned down the Apple watch.  But this old man still can learn new tricks, and this watch really surprised me with its versatility.

Let's be honest: I got this watch because  1) I am an android user,  2) I was taking a 2-week European vacation,  3) it was available on Warehouse Deals for cheap, and 4) I wanted to have the convenience and security benefits of paying with NFC without pulling out my phone.  I really couldn't have cared less about any of the other features.

Suffice it to say that for my intended purpose, the watch worked admirably.  But on the trip, it also gave me information about my steps and actvity which was great.  I could check for messages from my travel mates without pulling out my phone.  The S3 was able to read out my GPS directions so it was less awkward to follow directions while walking.  And I discovered that I could change watch faces at a whim.  Way more than I expected.  And I loved using the rotating bezel as a control.

Now nothing is perfect and that's true with this watch.  To be fair, I gave it the highest rating because it far exceeded my expectations and made me a believer in the usefulness of smart watches.  However, it is important to know these

First, although the stated battery life is 2 days, when you are traveling and using it a lot it's safer to assume 1 day.  There was one day where my charger came apart from the wall and the watch did not charge overnight, so it died half-way though the day.  I feel that there should have been some low battery warnings before it shut off, but I didn't get any.  So that's why I gave only 4 stars on battery life.

Second, the main button of the watch stopped functioning.  However, I made it through the trip and shipped it to Samsung and they repaired it at no charge.  So while it was good that I could function without the main button, it was disconcerting that it broke during the trip.  At any rate, all fixed and all good now, so still a good deal.

Third, you need to note that with your phone constantly in connection with your watch, it is likely that you will see reduced battery life on your phone.  This hit hardest while traveling, and probably was exacerbated by the different networks we were using, but the upshot is that you can put the watch into Airplane mode and make up to 5 purchases before it needs to sync with your phone again.  So unless you are constantly using the watch, then you can do that.  However, then you won't get any notifications.  This shouldn't count against the S3 specifically but I gather will be true of all smartwatches.

Fourth, it may interfere with bluetooth connectivity to your car stereo.  I have had some issues and have found that putting the watch in Airplane mode solves most of them.  I mean, you don't want to check messages or get phone calls on your watch, do you?  Still, a minor inconvenience.

Fifth, although this smartwatch supposedly allows you to use dictation similar to a limited Siri or Google agent, it is way worse with word recognition than the phones themselves.  Almost unusable, IMO.

Again, these shortcomings do not affect my current usage of the watch, but may well prevent adoption of newer features.  In my book, this watch is a home run for Samsung and has changed my mind about smartwatches.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Reinehr","SUCH an upgrade over my Asus ZenWatch 2","June 5, 2019","I purchased the Gear S3 Frontier to replace my ZenWatch 2, and wow is it an upgrade! The watch itself is very sturdy, I love the rotating bezel, and the widgets are great. (I'm using weather, agenda/day calendar, health dashboard, app shortcuts, reminders, and alti-barometer.) I finally found a nice and simple watchface that displays time, date, weather, steps, and sunrise/sunset, AND is customizable. It's a black background with no real visual bells and whistles, and I'm easily getting 50% more battery life than I was before. I could get even more by disabling the Always On Display... but I don't want to. ;)

I've been very impressed with the activity tracker. The moment I've been walking for 10 minutes, it kicks in and starts recording time, steps, and pace. I don't sleep wearing the watch, but the sleep tracker has kicked in on me while dozing in my recliner, and it seems accurate enough.

The only downsides for me:

Samsung Store is... bad. Very bad. Hard to find anything. Details on the app/watchface are lacking.

I'm using this watch with a OnePlus 6T and can't get Samsung Pay installed. There is a workaround floating around out there that involves sideloading an older version, then upgrading from within the Gear Android app, but that doesn't work anymore. Bummed about this. I really wanted to try out tap & pay on a magnetic swipe terminal. Oh, well.

All in all, this watch is definitely worth the price I paid. Glad I finally took the plunge.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have read the online manual to try to better understand the functionality, but some things just do not work as they are supposed to. I would strongly urge the potential buyer to go to the Samsung Forum and read some of the comments. I wish that I had done that. So, here are a couple of disappointments. The watch simply does not recognize flights of stairs climbed. The record sleep function, unless I don't know how to use it, only records the last period of uninterrupted sleep. So if you happen to get up at 4;00 to go to the bathroom and get up at 6:00 it reports that you slept 2 hours. I have kept the number of apps to a minimum in order to save drain on battery and I think that helps. Over all pretty satisfied and hope that a software update will soon correct the functionality absent, but promised.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I love that it looks like a watch (i.e. is round).  Someone looking at your wrist from afar would just assume that you're wearing a chronograph watch or a sports watch. Its barely bigger than the Movado Series 800 chronograph that I used to wear.  The rotating bezel is an example of great user interface design. I can quickly navigate through the widgets and apps. The abttery life is very good, I get close to 3 days of normal use.

People complain about the lack of Samsung apps, but what apps are really missing? Are you going to watch YouTube on a screen that is less than 2 inches wide? Are you going to be surfing the web on such a small screen?  Or send out tweet after tweet? If you need to send a lengthy response to a text message, would you really want to do that on a watch? You can with the Gear S3 but it seems that you'd more likely pull out your phone to o that. So given the concept of using the proper tool for the proper task, what's actually missing?

There's an endless selection of watchfaces, you have weather, reminders, alarms, access to your contacts, your texts, your email, and your calendar, You can use Samsung Pay with your watch. Samsung's fitness tools such as a step counter, heartbeat monitor, floor counter. You have access to the Samsung Health app with all of its workouts. You have an Altimeter and Barometer. There's a maps app, though I don't see myself trying too use a map on a screen this small. You can store pictures, and music on the watch.  You can leave your phone in a different room and still be connected to the watch as long as they're both connected to the same network. The Always On Display is neat if you want to always see a watchface so that it looks like you're wearing a regular watch.  Though the AOD versions of some of the watchfaces are not that great looking.

Some things don't work perfectly. For instance, the ""Floors"" counter often does not count flights of stairs that I've walked up. The Altimeter is probably a little off. When the watch reminds you to get active and suggest an activity (like a Torso Twist), it doesn't always notice that you've started the suggested activity. I haven't gone through all of the workouts that the phone has available to it, so I can't speak to how accurate the watch records them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After my last phone holder broke, I decided to purchase the Gear S3 and give it a shot to see if it would be any better.  When I received it, I thought it would be more difficult to pair with my phone, but it ended up being a piece of cake.  Just a few easy steps.  For someone that has limited use of their motor skills, accessing and operating the touch screen is rather easy.  It's voice feature is just as good, if not better, than any other blu tooth or phone device that I've used in the past.

Awesome.","May 2, 2018","This watch is one of the best tech purchases I've made in a long time. This watch tracks activity and sleep nicely. Recognizes if you start working out and has options for you to select specific types of workouts if you wish. Accurately tracks sleep (compared with gf's fitbit) and gives you all the info on the Samsung health app. Battery life is pretty long; however, it does charge pretty slowly I never really find this to be a problem though. As it is only water resistant I tend to charge it while I shower which keeps the battery life at a comfortable level. Obviously if you're doing workout programs and gps run tracking it'll suck the battery down faster but that's expected. Tracks pulse steps flights of stairs and various other things. It shows my calender events, sms notifications and even the weather. Super handy. Watch is awesome and looks sweet.

It has an amazing screen, good connection, good sound. But who cares about all of that if you don't have apps to use on this thing.

No maps, gotta pay money for a crappy third party version.
No SMS app
No workout with drawings

Okay, I lied. If you own a Samsung phone then all of that is included, but if you're like me and own another Android phone, it's useless. Nice watch face. Yayyy.

I returned it. This is a joke, $300 for a dumb smart watch.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews"

-The charger stops at 100% but that's it. It does not keep it charged at 100% if you leave it on the charger after that and does slowly lose its charge. I do not have this problem when using my friend's charger for the exact same model.
-The battery life on the watch is alright, but not as lengthy as I was hoping for. Requires 2-3 charges per day depending on usage.
-The watch does not come with a pre-installed timer app, which common sense would tell you should be one of the most very basic features all watches should have. You have to connect the watch to a compatible smartphone, and then manually download and install a timer app onto the watch through Bluetooth.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I loved it.

I have enjoyed using my watch daily for ~14 months with good battery life throughout the day and would charge it on the OEM charger on my nightstand every night... then one day my battery life would drain almost 50% within just a couple hours with no change in use patterns or software or anything.

I contacted Samsung Customer Service to try to troubleshoot the problem - they had me ship it to their service center. They told me that it needed a software update, the back was cracked and needed repair, and that they needed to replace the battery. Then they notified me that my warranty expired just over a month ago and it would cost me ~$75 for the repairs.

After doing some research I found that it is fairly common for the battery to swell during charging and crack the back glass and cause the battery to drain rapidly.

If Samsung would have recognized the manufacturing defect and fixed the problem at their cost - it would have been an inconvenience but I would have forgiven all. However they stuck to the warranty and told me to pay up or they would return my watch un-repaired. Very disappointing.","2.0 out of 5 stars","",""

The clarity of the screen is better than the Apple watch I had previously and love that I'm feeling like I'm wearing a traditional watch again. The biggest issue is the battery life. I read reviews and claims from Samsung that boasted the battery could last for days. This has been far from the case. I was looking for a new smart watch because my Apple couldn't make it through a typical work day. This one is even worse. If on by 6:00 am, a trip to the gym, and a typical work day, the watch is dead by 2:00 pm. This is absolutely unacceptable. What's the point of a watch if it's dead before even a twelve hour cycle, let alone 24 hours. I love the tech and Samsung has a great name but either I got a defective product that needs returned or the claims of extended battery life are just not true. Would appreciate any help!

First, the positive:

-  The actual smart features are great.  Notifications come through clearly, talk to text feature is great for responding to messages, auto responses equally as good
- Love the bezel for navigation.  That's a great way to navigate from screen to screen
- The screen and the colors are really bright.  Crystal clear and easy to read
- The customization of the faces (specifically the preloaded ones) are also a nice touch, and offer a lot of variety between the fitness features  and the ""luxury"" look
- I like the Samsung pay feature.  It does take a couple seconds for it to load once the cards activate, but the NFC functionality works pretty flawlessly

Now, what I don't like:
- The battery life is two days tops, but on average about 1.5 days
- The fitness features, specifically the HRM is terrible.  I participate in HIIT exercises on a daily basis, and it says I only burn 200 - 300 calories.  I recently purchased a chest HRM, and during the same exercises say that I am burning 800 - 900 calories.

So while overall, while I like it as a smart watch, I am going to sell it and focus on a watch that is more geared towards fitness, such as a Garmin.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Throwback to 1970s.","July 20, 2017","The watch has great promise and will someday be superb. But for now, the battery is mediocre. Need to charge it every day, even with moderate use.  The display is gorgeous, but you can't leave it on, or the battery will die just a few hours.  So, it's like having an old LCD watch from the 1970s when they first came out.  You have to lift the watch  (a hand gesture, for you millennials reading this review) to turn on the display, or press a button, if you are in bed - gravity of lying down doesn't affect the hand gesture.  I mean seriously? Talk about 1970s flashback?
The real issue for me is that the GPS Is flawed.  I tested it for running, using Samsung Health, connected to a Galaxy S8, and the results were erratic and very inaccurate.  According to Android developers, the GPS function only tests every 5 seconds, as opposed to most running watches that test every 1 second.  It will probably be fixed by Samsung in a firmware update.

I have the 3G version which included a SIM slot for its own cell line in case you wanted to detach it from your Samsung phone and use it as a standalone phone. Therefore, this review is mainly between these two watches.

First off, let's talk about the aspects where the original Gear S wins over the S3. The original Gear S is noticeable lighter, and feels more comfortable around your wrist, especially if you have smaller wrists. The curved design of the Gear S also makes it easier to see the watch face, and easier to use - your presses and swipes feel easier and more natural. I also like the band which comes with the Gear S, as it makes wearing it and taking it off a much simpler, faster, and easier process - I can pretty much wear and take off the Gear S in about 1 second, whereas it would take me about 2-3 seconds to take off the S3, and about 5 seconds to put it on because you have to hook it into the hole, and then slide the tongue underneathe the two holding bands.

However, I prefer the S3 in these areas: It feels faster and snappier to use. Also, since it has newer technologies, the apps that come with it feels more modern and robust. Tizen has come a long way since the very first original Gear, and although it still has a long ways to go, at least you can see some slight improvements. Ultimately though, I feel Tizen is taking too long to progress, and will soon be forgotten, or relegated to being a smart watch OS only, and not something that can be used on phones. The screen of the Gear S3 feels brighter and more colorful, no doubt the progression of Samsung's watch OLED technology. The rotating bezel and extra button on the S3 also make using it easier, and gives it more functionality. Maybe it is just my watch, but I would like the bezel to rotate with more clamping force, as it feels too loose and easy to accidentally be moved. The watch face of the S3 looks and feels much more premium than the older S, as the metal parts make it look like a more expensive rugged watch, as opposed to the Gear S' more elegant 007/Dick Tracy spy watch style design. I also think the speaker on the S3 is just a tad louder than the Gear S. The S3 also has more and better watch faces than the Gear S.

In the end, I decided to keep both watches, for different occasions. The Gear S3 is my everyday watch, while the Gear S is more suited for a jog or something where you don't watch a big thick heavy watch to weigh you down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Initially I was happy with the watch. I noticed it would automatically detect when I am exercising and record. Awesome! It kept track of little things like flights of steps and I loved that. But slowly I starting realizing many nuances like my running distance/time was off. Way off in the case of long runs. The HR would measure very slowly in comparison to other watches with wrist-based HR monitors. The bezel on the face of the watch is lose.

As far as I can tell, I bought a new one but when it arrived, it's says ""Certified refurb""...

Original review: This thing has plagued me since purchase. I wanted to love it so much and, at times, I did love it. Here is my journey:

-At first it had a problem staying in sync with my phone. Whenever it got separated, I had to reset the entire device to factory settings. An eventual update fixed that problem.

-The heart rate monitor stopped working. Still doesn't work. I didn't really care about this feature at first but then it became important to me. I miss it now that it's gone.

-Battery lasted for days when I bought it. Now, it won't last a twelve hour work day. Six hours, sometimes.

-After the latest update, I have to manually log into Samsung Health every couple of days. I love dialing verifications to prove I'm not a robot.

-It no longer tracks my steps. At all.

Other features still work great. Media, apps, controlling other devices, phone calls. I'm just frustrated. For a while, it was great. The last few months have been dogged with the loss of functionality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Tizen OS surprised me with it's nicely designed UI elements and ease of access to everything.

The only complaint (hence the 4 stars instead of 5) is incredibly poor app support. Compared to Android Wear, which has a watch app for literally every normal Android app, Tizen has pretty much nothing. The only app I've installed so far is Yelp. Really disappointed with that.

It's seriously almost like having a second phone. Typically when I see something advertised as ""Military quality"" I think its gonna be a POS that breaks in 3 months, as most equipment in the military does. But I'm military and have had this for nearly 4 or 5 months now and it holds up great for the use and abuse (given I do have tempered glass for it).

I was also pretty skeptical of the water resistance. However, one day, being in a massive rush, I showered with it on. Not even a single glitch. The only issue was water would get in the speakers and plug up the noise (I had music playing), inevitably giving me a heart attack, but then it would pop clear and it was perfectly fine. (If you blow in the speakers, the water will come right out).

Pictures display GORGEOUSLY, though it was hard for my phone to focus on its screen. To transfer photos (and music) you need to use the watch app on your phone. Real quick process, but be mindful you don't have a lot of storage.

Still absolutely flawless. This is my first smart watch so I'm pretty blown away. I got a really dapper Pipboy (Fallout) watch face. There are TONS of watch faces to choose from aside from the basic ones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

That means this thing's main job is to tell TIME... But since we're also calling it a ""SMARTwatch"", shouldn't it at LEAST be able do everything the best ""DUMBwatch"" can do?

******************

I FORGOT... WHAT'S A WATCH, AGAIN?

Before we get ahead of ourselves, let's start with the basics -- the features that make a great watch. There are several optional features available in traditional watches and if this one's going to be SMARTER than average, I believe it should have MOST of these features straight out of the box.

A smartwatch should have (and prioritize) the following basic functions:

1. A full-featured Chronograph. Currently, the stopwatch feature only exists as a widget on the default watch face, rather than as a standalone watch mode. This means that if you customize the watch face, you'll lose your stopwatch.
2. A Timer. There should be a standalone mode to sound an alarm after a desired number of minutes pass. Currently, there is no built-in timer on the watch.
3. An Alarm. You should be able to efficiently set at least one alarm that will sound/vibrate at a specified time of day or week.
4. A World Clock. There should be a simple ability to switch between home time zone and a minimum of 2 other saved locales. Consider allowing a GMT hand/time.

Currently these key functions either don't exist at all on the watch or are separate apps that are not grouped in any logical fashion. (Currently there is an Alarm and a World Clock app but I believe they should be grouped logically and accessed more conveniently than any of the watch's ""smart"" features.)

SIDENOTE: I currently own a Citizen WR100 that can do all of the aforementioned. It was made like... 30 years ago and manages all these functions without the benefit of a CPU, RAM, or touch screens.
Despite the incredible advancements in technology since the manufacture of that watch, this 3rd generation Samsung ""smartwatch"" has been designed to perform far FEWER timekeeping functions than my 30-year-old ""dumbwatch...""

How does that make sense?

******************

THE WATCH BAND

Before I start on the ""smart"" watch features, I have to mention the watch band.

You should know it's been reported by a significant number of users that the included silicon watch band causes friction burns; I've experienced a bit of it myself. It is also impossible (for me) to make it fit comfortably, as the clasp half of the strap is not long enough to keep the watch face centered on my 7.5"" wrist.
The watch includes an optional shorter perforated half, but NOT a longer clasp half, so there's no way to center the clasp and watch face without over-tightening the band.

Although the band is silicone, the watch case is 316L Stainless Steel and appears well-made. Simply put, it should have been paired with a traditional and matching stainless steel band with removable links. Sure, it's more expensive to produce, but considering the number of people who have experienced discomfort and scarring from wearing the silicon band, it's far better to begin with a proper steel band and allow customization afterward if desired. If such a band cannot be provided with the watch, a matching band should at least be made available by Samsung for a nominal fee.

As of right now, it's only possible to acquire steel bands from a 3rd party, and only various leather, textile, and silicon bands can be purchased directly from Samsung. These bands have the same dimensions as the included silicon band, however, so if the original band doesn't fit properly, purchasing ANY replacement band from Samsung will only perpetuate your discomfort.

******************

SMARTWATCH FEATURES

Get ready to think wayyy outside the box...

You need to think of this watch as being DUMBER than a normal watch and SMARTER than a flip phone, but never knowing quite enough about watches or phones to do what you really want. At MOST, it's a wrist-borne relay point between you and your smartphone. It's like a middle[wo]man that allows you to:

1. Send txts or reply to messages from a preset list of allowed apps
2. Place and answer phone calls, mute the built-in microphone, and adjust the speaker volume with the bezel. (Perfect.)
3. Read notifications (from certain apps)
4. Continue playing music you've recently started on your phone, adjust the volume, and skip tracks with the bezel. (In my opinion, the bezel should control the volume, not skipping tracks. Who skips that many tracks without seeing the working playlist?)
5. Make payments via Samsung Pay
6. Et al.

It can collect biometrics intermittently for S Health as well, monitoring your steps, heart rate, and sleep efficiency. These features seem to work fairly well, but you may experience some discomfort if you allow the watch to collect heart rate data throughout the day. (The watch can get a bit warm/hot.)

******************

OOPS...

As smart as these features may be, the watch isn't good at doing ANY of them simultaneously... Btw, that includes telling TIME.
[Yes. You read that correctly. Just because you've got a watch, you should NOT expect it to tell time... It's 2018, ok? Things are different now.]

If you attempt to switch tasks or lower your arm in the midst of a reply, you are likely to lose your work. That adds up to a LOT of wasted life if you've started drafting your txts on a 1.25"" screen...

You also cannot switch tasks during certain processes, like:

1. Taking phone calls.
During a call, a user cannot leave the call screen for any reason. And when I say ""not for any reason"", I literally mean that a person wearing this ""watch"" CANNOT CHECK THE TIME OR DATE, nor can they execute any other function during a call. So by design, the primary purpose of this product can't be realized while it attempts to be MORE than a basic watch; it literally CEASES to be a watch while you're taking a call!
Did I just buy a broken watch?
--------------------
When I first realized I couldn't read the time while staring at my $300 watch, I almost said THIS to the person I was talking to:
""Excuse me, do you have the time? I really SHOULD have it, but... apparently I don't.""
I couldn't make my mouth say those ridiculous words, though. Instead, I did what Samsung expected:
I used my free hand to pull out my PHONE so I could use it like a WATCH while I talked into my WATCH like a PHONE...
--------------------
Do I really have to explain the magnitude of failure involved here? I hope not, because it HURTS MY BRAIN to even relive that moment. All I'll say is it's completely UNACCEPTABLE for such an advanced piece of technology to EVER SUCK THAT HARD.

1a.  If notifications come in during a call, don't expect to see them for more than half a second.
1b. And... if notifications come in during a call, don't even HOPE to reply.

2. During a workout, you're stuck with S Health on the screen. If you want to use a different feature or app, you've gotta end (not pause) your workout. But hey, at least it'll flash the time of day real quick when you wake the screen! That immediately makes S Health the best app on the watch!

******************

BUT WAIT -- THERE'S LESS

I think any good ""smart"" device should have strong app support to keep it relevant. Unfortunately, though, this watch lacks support from the major msg-based apps you use on a daily basis, like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, likely owing (in part) to the fact that it is built on the Linux Tizen platform, as opposed to the Android platform developers are already writing for in the Google Play Store. So without standalone apps, it is really difficult [read ""impossible""] to respond to and keep track of any non-SMS msg thread.

For example...
Let's say you get a notification from Facebook Messenger and catch a glimpse of a truncated msg from your best friend... only to get 3 MORE Messenger notifications at once without time enough to read them all. The notifications disappear as each new msg comes in and you wind up missing so much of the thread that you just let your arm drop... defeated... to your side, as you wrestle out your phone to see WTF YOU JUST MISSED...

Sound stressful? Oh good... I've described it PERFECTLY.

******************

THE BOTTOM LINE

It's basically like this -- this device is barely DUMB enough to reliably be a watch. And it's barely SMART enough to reliably be a smartphone... In truth, it's neither watch nor smartphone; it's a clumsy, expensive, half-baked concept that makes this product fall miles behind the standard of quality you'd expect from Samsung.

I wish I could say better, because I really love Samsung products. In fact, I enjoy my Galaxy S8 phone so much that I recently got a Samsung NP940X5N laptop, and I love that product too. They're the best phone and computer I've ever had... But I can't say the same about this watch!","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Already I have two hardware problems - the rotating bezel sticks and requires considerable effort to turn and, yesterday, the speaker stopped working.

I contacted Samsung support and got some Indian chap who didn't know the product at all. When he asked for my serial number he couldn't tell me where to find it. I finally found the Gear Info screen and gave him the number and he claimed his system couldn't find it so he had to escalate me. He couldn't even forward me, he had to send me an email with a phone number.

So now I have to call a number to a woman with a very strong accent and loud noise behind her so I could barely understand her. I repeated all the information I gave the first guy and she makes me do a factory reset which wipes all my data. Obviously it didn't work so now they're going to send me an envelope to put my watch in. But they're having problems getting envelopes to people (probably because of the huge volume of people getting their watches fixed) so I'm going to be without my watch for a couple of weeks.

I used to think Samsung was a quality company, but I see they're not. I have a watch with mechanical issues within six weeks of purchase and a broken technical support system to deal with. I have a bad feeling they will return my watch unfixed and then claim it's outside the warranty. There's still another star I can remove.

Update: Although the start of the return process felt like it was being run by one man in his garage rather than a multi-national corporation, once I had got my watch back to Samsung the process was well handled. I received emails when the watch was received, started repair, suspended for lack of replacement parts, and when a new watch was shipped to me. I'll add a star back.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_40?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=40&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Again, primarily a fitness watch.  So, I did the usual fitness things, hiked, jogged, the usual sweat causing activities. Then about 6 months later, it started randomly flickering. Didn't think anything of it.  Two months after that, it starting dimming.  A month ago, starting doing both on rotation to the point that the watch was useless. As you can see, I'm a pretty tolerant person to walk around with a flickering watch for a couple of months. Finally had enough in Aug and notified Samsung that my watch might be faulty. Under 12 months, it was still covered under warranty. They sent me a label, sent it in. Waiting about 10 days to be told that my watch was not under warranty due to ""water damage"". I've NEVER submerged the watch as I was a bit paranoid to begin with of it's ""water resistance"" for a $300 techy watch.  Only water that touched that watch was sweat on my arm.  So was informed from Samsung that they had ""GREAT NEWS"", they could swap it out for only $230. I told them to shove it. They said they'd send it back.

However I love the outside dial around the face for accessing apps and other features.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So many neat features and it connects so well to my Samsung device and it's a fun way to answer phone calls. Its sturdy, its waterproof.

But now the battery drains instantly where it used to last all day. I charge it to 100 overnight, put it on, it's at 90 in 30 minutes. If you leave it on your desk on power saving mode and don't touch it for 3-4 hours, I promise it will be dead or at around 10%. Just in the time of writing these two paragraphs it has dropped from 92 to 89%. Its jaw dropping to look down and see its dropped another percent EVERY time you look at it. Ridiculous.

Its not just me. If you Google ""gear s3 battery drain"" you'll see nearly EVERY owner of this watch eventually deals with this. Their customer service will not help, they just tell you to pay to have it repaired or replaced.

(Original Review: March 2018)
My only 2 gripes are that there are so few native apps, and no Google assistant.

The watch looks and runs fantastically, I get great battery life. The display is the best smartwatch display on the market. The speaker and microphone works great! I swapped out the rubber band for a black stainless steel one, and it looks good on my wrist.

Samsung Pay on a watch feels like magic every time I use it, that MST tech from Samsung is pretty damn cool. It can fall back on NFC too.

Update Oct. 2019: The rotating bezel fell out. It's impossible to find a replacement. There is 4 tiny plastic ball bearings the size of cupcake sprinkles under the bezel, and no way to replace those, the PLASTIC retainer ring for the bezel gets worn out by the metal bezel friction. So basically, this watch is disposable. Also, the glass back is very fragile. I loved this watch but it is not ""military grade"" construction or durability. I loved it until it broke.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The watch is very nice to look at, the AMOLED screen is awesome, it's a bit heavy, but the issue I had was overall functionality of the software. Unfortunately much of the utility that I had hoped to realize from this device was not materialize.  My personal opinion is that the Samsung S Health software is not yet to the point of really being used for anything more than outdoor running and counting steps (outside the GPS probably does fine, but indoor track running or walking does not work well).  At $350, this is a very expensive pedometer.  I know, I know, you are saying to me to me right now ""Hey, it is supposed to help you reduce some of the hands on that is required to interact with your phone, email, and messaging!"", and it does some of that very nicely.  The notifications are very good and I did like being able to read email through the watch and see my text messages, including attached pictures.  However, a large part of my daily routine is swimming, walking, lifting and other physical activities throughout  the week and this watch does not really improve my workout tracking.  In fact, It took me backwards from a capability standpoint.  For example, for my morning stretching, I had to use my phone to start and stop this activity.  Then it is off to swim for 30 to 40 minutes, oops, that activity has to be started and stopped on the phone.  That is unless, you want to track your different activities as an ""other workout"".  Not much value there for me.  I returned the Gear S3 and took out my 2 year old Garmin Vivoactive and while that watch is nor perfect by any stretch, I can start and stop all of my activities from my wrist and I don't have to lug my cell phone with me.  Additionally, I was not going to get the S3 with the cell service, I didn't see the point in having more cost in this very expensive solution and that option will not change haw the different activities have to be initiated, on the cell phone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The first impression was really good. It looks stylish, lightweight, comfortable to wear with various outfits. But..here it comes the bad part - the software is a total crap. It requires reboots on daily basis to operate normally. It seems there is a memory leak and the watch becomes unusable. Most of the sport modes are not operating very well - for instance the bicycle mode never worked. It does not detect GPS, it does not detect movements and all gauges stay in 0 values. The running mode works, but looses GPS signal very often. Running outside and notifies my very often - ""No GPS connection. Move to an open area"". The battery lasts approx 2 days in normal operation mode, which is acceptable. Notifications sometimes are quite annoying. I usually use DND mode during the night, but stills wakes me up to say it's running out of battery - why?!?!
If you want to use it mainly for sport activities choose another brand, for notifications and self-esteem use Gear S3.

I really hope the Tizen 4 will be much more stable and support Gear S3.

I'll outline the Pros and Cons below, but they could very easily make an app change which, in my mind, would make this a five star product.  I'm not sure if it would be a Google or Samsung change, but it would set this watch apart.

Pros:
- The looks.  I am 6', average build and I think it looks great.  As with many modern watches it is large, but not overly big in my opinion.
- Tactile feel. I like the rotating bezel.  For me it is intuitive to use and clicks in nicely.  The touchscreen is responsive and accurate.  For me I wish the back button was the bottom button, but once I trained myself it is a non-issue.
- Display. It really is nice looking.  When used in the always on mode I have had multiple people tell me they had no idea it was a digital watch.
- Function. Apart from the one major con below, the watch does everything I need it to seamlessly.  Alerts are timely and there is almost zero lag in function.  Everything flows nicely and the shortcuts are great.
- Samsung Pay!  I have been using SP on my S7 Edge for quite a while and it is so much more efficient on the watch.  It is faster (no fingerprint) and to me it seems to work from greater distance than the phone.  It is kind of funny some of the looks tellers give you when you pay with your watch.  (Many times they will say something like, oh we don't have that here. -BEEP- Wow, how did you do that.)
- Battery Life. First let me say I typically run the watch with Always On turned off.  I do occasionally turn it on, but for me I typically leave it off.  My normal daily procedure is to wear the watch all day and then at night to track my sleep.  When I wake to shower and eat breakfast I'll take the watch off (it is normally from 70-80% charged still) and place it on the charger.  By the time I head out the door for work it is back at 100%.

Cons:
- The one MAJOR problem I have with this watch is the lack of integration with Google.  I can't wrap my head around why this is set up this way, but it is very frustrating.  I would consider myself a heavy Google user.  Unfortunately I have had to stop using the Google GMail and Messenger apps.  The reason I have stopped using them is you can receive and reply to messages from these apps, but you cannot initiate a message.  It is really too bad because for me they are far better than the S7 Edge's messenger and email program.  I also NEED to see programs such as Maps run natively on the watch.  Yes there are alternative mapping programs you can install on the watch, but they fall far short of Google's own apps.  This watch would be a hands down 5 star device if Google apps ran natively on it.
- The other issue I have occasionally had is the watch recognizing I am looking at it and turning the screen on (this is with Always On turned off). I don't know if it the way I hold my arm, wrist, or something else I'm doing wrong; but from time to time I have to hit a button or spin the bezel to turn on the screen.

Overall I'm very impressed with the watch.  Feel free to ask any questions or leave any comments.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

As there is no way to resolve this with software the watch is missing a major feature. HOWEVER, I did reach out to Amazon customer service and they were fantastic in helping me get this figured out and having a replacement sent with expedited shipping.

So after giving up on that one and some more research I decided to go with the Gear S3. Especially attracted by the Frontier, since it has a bigger and more ""adventurer"" design than the regular or ""sport"" one. Plus, I have a quite large wrist, so that was also a perfect fit for me. But in case the band was too big (long), they also added in the box a smaller (shorter) one.

Worked perfectly right out of the box, after the initial required full charge (the watch was at 50% when I received it). Setup may be a bit complicated for those who aren't used to smart watch, so I advice you to read the user manual that comes with it (or watch YouTube video about the watch and how to set it up). Also, after the first setup, Samsung send you an email reminding you of your watch serial number (useful if your watch got stolen), along with the user manual in .PDF format, which is much more easier to read than the included small paper version, and also search-able too.

I had a Android watch before, so using this one and set it up was pretty straight forward for me, even if this is a Samsung Gear watch and not Android specific watch. Which means there may be some Android apps that will not be compatible with it. But so far, all the apps I used with my old Android watch, works fine with this one. Some review state that Samsung do not have enough apps selection, but so far I was happy with the quite a great selection of apps available, so I was able to choose a neat face watch, along with some other great apps I needed for the watch.

Heart monitor works flawlessly, but I do have to tighten the watch a little bit more for it to read the hear beats accurately. Love the turning bezel as well, and it give a nice genuine watch look to it. Matter of fact, if I change the watch face to be a classic one with analog display (the needles one), the watch look like if it was one of those genuine expensive analog one. The screen resolution is so great and bright (even outside), that if you don't look closer you really think that those needles pointing at the time are real.

On the battery side, I have everything on in the watch (except GPS for now), and it run for about 1 day and 20 hours without a charge. If I select ""power saving"" mode, then I could have up to 4 days of battery without charging the watch. Although, I have a habit to charge it every night before bed, so that's not a problem for me to leave all the gadgets on, and I can fully enjoy the watch and its performance.

In short this was a great buy, which I definitely recommend if you're looking for a new smart watch, or replacement to an old one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The battery life is great, pairing is easy, and the fact that you can text and call from it can be convenient. I love how it works with my S8+, as if they were made for each other (well, they were). The options of different bands and watch faces is cool, as well as even placing a cover on it to completely change the color. The screen is bright, and can be dim. There are many things this watch does good- and believe me it's an amazing smartwatch! Except mine is a mess.
I'm honestly not sure what the issue is. I have tizen 4, I only have 3 watchfaces installed, and have so little apps that can be uninstalled. And yet my watch lags. It's been lagging since I got it, lagging after uninstalling almost everything, removing widgets, reset, etc. And yet it lags. Raising your wrist to see the time can sometimes take as much as 2 seconds! And receiving a notification and checking it by raising the wrist is an awful 4-5 seconds. Pressing the notification has a delay. Choosing the text option has a delay. Load, load, I can now type. Now I can send- delay. It's slow and tedious.
Loading up apps- delay and slow
Reading messages- delay and slow
Responding to messages- so slow and delayed its quicker to pull out your phone and type the same message-20 times... From when you receive the notification, to when your message sends on your watch. Now typing on a smartwatch is going to be slow, but what kills it is the lag of loading and reading the message, pressing anything on the watch to respond to it or show on the phone, or even opening the messaging app. I can't believe this costed me $250- for a watch that just feels slow. Even using the bezel to go through the little widgets I have can be slow. I clear my apps, reset it, all of that. This watch is a disappointment. At this point it's only good for fashion and step tracking. It can do many more features, but it's so slow it's just a complete turn off.

Firmware update every couple months changed how it charges & uses battery,  First few caused watch to over-heat so it shut down charging, then it would only charge to 78%, now it charges to reported 100% but that 100% is less than 50% of original battery capacity, now battery only lasts about 18 hours (set medium brightness, turn off display after a couple seconds).  I wanted to monitor sleep, and activity during the day, but I have to charge it about 3x per day or it will go into power saving mode.  Fitness app doesn't show heart rate throughout the day, only when you open app and tell it to measure (can't use workout mode for heart rate monitoring, because battery dies very quickly!).  Previous tracker was Jawbone UP III, and it would plot heart rate for entire 24 hour period, monitor sleep, and charge every 2.5 days, I have to keep a charger at work, one by the bed, and one in the living room and put it on charger anytime I'm not moving, or battery dies.  Display is great, it's lasted well (except band failed within 3 weeks), I use a screen protector.  Factory charger,cable,adapter still occasionally warn that I need to use original charger, after-market charger purchased recently for the office also occasionally generates that warning.  Other chargers purchased previously have been disabled by firmware updates that prevent use of  non-Samsung charger.

The bottom of the box had a label on top of another label, which I assume was hiding the fact that it was a Romanian version.  The default language of the watch I received was Romanian.  If you buy this watch from this vendor you can save almost $40.

The potential problem with a NON-US version is that it may require to use older versions of the corresponding phone app to support all the expected functionality of the watch, and then your phone may not support other newer Samsung wearables.  Still it may operable in the US, but perhaps not exactly the same as the US version.  For most it may be a minor inconvenience, but I wanted full US functionality as I had with my previous S2.

I work in a very loud environment, where it's not practical to keep your phone in your pocket. So I'd always miss calls and messages. Even when I did try and keep my phone with me, I wouldn't hear alerts, or feel the phone vibrate due to the machines surrounding me.

With the Gear S3, I still can't hear anything come through, but I can feel the watch vibrate due to it being strapped to my wrist.

Since I've had the S3, I've never missed an important call or message, and that makes it the perfect solution for me.

It's made such a difference that 3 others whom work with me, have gone out and bought one too.

I turned off the always on display, and chose a watch face with a black background, and I get between 3 and 4 days with a single charge, with general usage.

Buggy.  Overly complicated.  Looking for something else.","May 24, 2019","Update at the end of this review...

Highlights:
Looks nice.
Reasonable selection of apps
Many watch face screens available

Problems:
Very poor battery life.  Less than a day in many cases if you use many watch apps for workouts, GPS, etc.
Only one alert tone leaves you wondering what you got an alert for.  This is truly awful.
All alerts are grouped together with minimal ability to turn them off.  This even includes stupid Samsung or carrier ads.
Very few useful watch faces
The text is often very small and difficult to read.  No easy-to-read options for many apps.  No way to enlarge fonts.
The watch goes brain dead at least daily for a minute or two.  Totally dark.  Resumes by itself.
Apps are often VERY SLOW. (For example it sometimes takes several seconds for steps to update once you are on that screen. Nearly all screens show old info for at least a second, then update.)
The Samsung Health app takes over the watch so you can't see other alerts or manage other apps while it is running (i.e. using S Health on a treadmill? Sorry, regular heartrate screen not available and SH heartrate too small to read or not updating.)
The heartrate monitor is generally pretty awful compared to the others I've used.
The watch restarts PHONE apps randomly. (i.e. Pandora on the PHONE starts playing by itself in the mddle of the night for no reason because you left the app open on your PHONE and the WATCH told it to start playing.)  Read that again.  It is really wierd and a known bug.
When you are playing music through your phone, your PHONE stops playing music when your WATCH moves out of bluetooth range and does not restart when you return.  You have to restart the music on the phone. (This is more annoying than you can imagine.)  No way to fix this other than turning off Bluetooth on your watch.  Known bug.
Is that enough?  I can go on.

This is my third smartwatch.  My first was a Fitbit Surge back in 2015.  That watch was a GREAT fitness tracker and had some basic smartwatch features like email/text alerts. What was nice about it was that every function I needed was only a click or two away.  Hop on a treadmill, push 2 buttons, tracking starts.  I also have an Apple 2 watch, which in hindsight did everything I needed it to, but many functions were more like 4 or 5 swipes/clicks away.  That might sound dumb, but when you are 4 or 5 swipes/clicks away from everything you use regularly, it starts to be a pain.  This Samsung Gear 3 watch?  It is...different.  It took months to get used to some of the  ways it handles things.  Rotating the bezzle is cool but kind of a chore and difficult to do precisely.  Swiping only works well if you set up your apps in the order you expect to use them. The standard app menu is awful.  And messages?  OMG this thing makes noise all the damn time and I can never figure out what kind of message I have gotten because the watch only has ONE ALERT TONE!  You swipe or rotate left to see message alerts.  You have to manually delete old alerts.

OK, I'm just going to stop here.  The phone has many good ideas in concept, but it is pretty awful in actual use.  The software just doesn't work well enough for me to recommend it.

Update:  The watch will no longer hold a charge for a full day, going completely dead by 6:00 pm.  I've had this watch for a little over a year now and the battery is already fried????  I decided to continue to use this watch until the next generation Apple phone comes out and then I'll be switching back....if I can last another month.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This watch has blown my mind. It records your sleep, steps, heartrate. It knows exactly when I start working out and goes into activity mode. There are so many cool watch faces available for this phone as well as custom watch bands and watch protector cases. It holds a charge for 3-4 days and recharges from 0% to 100 in a couple hours.

You can feel it is a gadget, not in the noble sense. The icing on the cake: supposedly IP68 certified, you can find statements explaining that you can swim with it for 30 minutes, anyways be underwater with a depth limit for sure but still placed underwater safely. Water Resistant isn't it. Truly false. I don't get the manufacturers who launch products with such a weakness. Barely resistant to showers (it is not even an immersion) and mine is ultimately dead with just a few splash in a water park. Ridiculous. Sent to client services for maintenance, I've been asked to pay around $250 to fix it (~price of a new one) since they didn't want to take ownership of the product weakness.

(Update below - back to awesome!)","May 31, 2018","This little watch was awesome when I got it as a birthday gift from my wife. I didn't really think I'd care much for a smartwatch, having always worn an analog watch through my adult life. But after I received it and was able to change the watch faces - how cool is that? Okay, what else can this little thing do? Well, it can measure your heartbeat - neat - oh wait, it can track my steps too? Okay - so now I can see if I've been a lazy fat butt. Now it's telling me I'm really lazy and should do a torso twist. Thanks, but I'm in the middle of an important meeting with a customer. I'm sure they'd appreciate it if I did a ""torso twist"" in the middle of our meeting because my watch said to. So what else - there's some apps out there, you can get navigation, which sounds neat but the reality is, I'm over 40 and can't see up close that great when I'm wearing my contacts. Last thing I need to be doing while driving is squinting to look at my watch for directions. Then there's weather, and the fact that I can do the Dick Tracy thing (call someone or receive a call) on my watch. (If you don't know who Dick Tracy is, Google it.) That's come in handy several times. I'm able to text (though if you're a long-time user of Google Voice like I am, it will use your paired device's number to send/reply with and not your GV number.) Wish there was a GV app for this! There's a weather app in case you don't go outside (why do you care about the weather if you're only inside? Go look out a window already!)  I even found a nifty Powerpoint app that I can link my watch to my laptop and use it as a remote. That is, until the watch goes to sleep in the middle of a slideshow. Everything in the Tizen OS seems to be nice and fast, no lagging at all. Keep in mind, this is not a Google or Android OS, it's Samsung's proprietary OS, they have their own apps for it, and the app store is somewhat lacking in my opinion. I wanted a simple stock ticker but apparently to do that, you have to have a constantly-on connection with your phone to receive updates as well as a separate app on your phone.

I kept getting this popup on the watch when I'd hit he buttons wrong - ""Try Samsung Pay!"" Finally, I broke down and decided to give it a try. I read up on the whole ""LoopPay"" setup and realized - this could actually be kinda cool! I setup a couple of cards in the system and decided to give it a shot at a few places while on a business trip. The area I was in was very tech saavy so most places had Near Field Communications (NFC) POS terminals. Beep! Payment accepted. Whoa. This is cool! Then, back to where I live - out in the country where some merchants still take checks. I nervously walked up to the POS terminal - everything I read says this should work. No NFC tap-type POS terminal here, just an older swipe terminal. Alright, deep breath - look for the mag-stripe read heads, hover the watch over it - BEEP - payment accepted. The clerk gives me this WTF look and said ""is that Apple Pay?? I didn't think we could do that!"" Then I have to explain to them, no, it's a special watch that can do this pretty much anywhere because it emulates a card swipe. The looks I get when I do this at these rinky-dink out-in-the-middle-of-nowhere merchants are priceless. Everything from the hair-grabbing ""ER MEH GERD!"" to open-mouthed googly-eyes. Once in a while I get someone giving me that skeptical ""are you trying to hack us?"" look, but it's extremely rare. I will warn you, if you use it at Wal-Mart they think you're using their Wal-Mart pay thing.

So now you're thinking - okay, this actually sounds pretty darn cool - why the heck did you give it one star? Sometime early in 2018, they issued out new firmware. Being that I keep my equipment updated, I went ahead and did it. (After all, it does nag you to do it all the time anyway.) I had no indication that this could be problematic. Update done. Supposed to ""fix battery problems"" they said. Wait, I was getting a whole day out of my watch, now I'm getting maybe 3-4 hours? That didn't fix anything, it made it worse! Well at least the Samsung Pay thing is pretty cool. That is, now the update causes the whole watch to completely shut down after I use Samsung Pay. I have to start it back up. This goes on for several weeks and I realize - the update has completely hosed my really cool watch. So I read up and sure enough, LOTS of people are complaining about this update. Not just a handful, but a LOT. Check YouTube. Okay, so what can I do to see if I can fix it? Reset it, everyone says - as a troubleshooting measure. Nice, now all my settings are gone (note to myself and others - you CAN backup your settings so you don't lose them through the phone app!) Still, no dice. Watch still has horrible battery life, yet when I put it on the charger it says 95% after it dies? I called Samsung support and they didn't even question me other than asking if I had tried resetting it. They didn't even flinch - here's your ticket number and a UPS label to send it back. Today, I tried to turn it on, and can't even get it to turn on after being on the charger all night. Today it goes to UPS and off to a ""repair center"" for 9-11 business days. I'll update this review once I get it back and have it for a week or two to see if it's fixed.

Update 6/22/2018 - I received the watch back, even though it was out of warranty they apparently opted to fix it for free since the update apparently caused the issue. They had it back to me within their 9-11 days easily so it wasn't gone too long. So far it's functioning like it used to before the update and I'm enjoying it again! Of course it was reset when I received it so I had to set everything up again, but while it was gone I discovered Samsung has a watch face designer where I was able to import a watch design I liked into the watch from a website.I also bought a Fossil Q gen 3 watch while this one was out for repair and while it's fairly nice, it doesn't even compare to this one. Lots more features and I still really like the ability to use Samsung Pay directly on the watch. (Lots of my local haunts know me as the guy that pays with his watch.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The mobile app works fine in setting everything up and changing faces. I like the ability to change the order of apps and widgets. I actually purchased a watch face (under $2) and love it, although many of the free faces are OK.  It connects to my calendar, texts, and notifications well. It is comfortable and looks great. Charging is very easy! Overall I am happy with my purchase, BUT:

What I do not like: It is a pain to get it to sync with my Outlook 365 accounts from work. I got it to finally work, but had to use intermediary software (Aqua mail) to do so. Come on Samsung, sync with outlook!

Also counting floors does not work at all. I have read forums and this seems to be a common error. Samsung claims to have a solution which is to clear all data and reset the watch. According to forum posts this does not work and is just a brush-off solution. I do not care if it counts floors, so no big deal to me, but if it is to you beware. It seems to count steps and monitor heart rate fine.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The first one was the gear fit which lasted 6 months and then stopped working, when I sent it to samsung they said it couldn't be fixed because its not manufactured in the US. I had bought it off Amazon and the description said it was a US version so they refunded me and I bought the more expensive gear s3 frontier because it is made for active people and supposed to be water resistant, 6 months later it stops. I sent in to samsung while still under warranty and they said it has water damage and cannot be fixed. The unit was never exposed to water, the only water I can think of is my sweat at the gym, which it is supposedly meant to be used for, being active. So I disputed this with the ""disputes department"" and was told the restriction was lifted and my device was authorized for repair so I sent it in again with a new ticket and label. I then get a call that it cannot be fixed again, so after speaking with multiple representatives I was told that the first ticket was not reviewed, that the authorization had not been seen and after speaking with the repair service center I was told an expedited shipping label would be sent within 24 hours for my device to be fixed. I called 24 hours later after not receiving a new ticket and shipping label and again I am told by technical support and case management that the repair was not authorized, and I was transferred back to the repair center which is now closed...

This has taken up so much time and effort. I am a loyal samsung customer, I have had multiple samsung phones and still us a galaxy s8. I help people transition to samsung after being apple users because i've trusted samsung as a brand for so long. To be honest I will never buy a samsung watch again, and I am very disappointed by the service I received. I will be calling again tomorrow to speak with the service center and hopefully get this cleared up and have my watch fixed.

I would definitely not recommend wasting your money on a samsung watch, they do not last.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Peabody","Great Watch","July 3, 2017","I like the watch but it falls short. The heart Beat monitoring only works if you are sleeping or sitting still. It is useless for sporting activities, it can never read if I am sweaty or riding a bike etc. It has a great display, but is lacking in functionality for what I like. It has a microphone icon on texting to speak into it, it acts like it hears me but does nothing. After the new update it works great and they even fixed the Samsung Pay app. I can now pay with the watch without a phone that qualifies.The speech recognition is good and I can text with just talking into it.  I really like the phone and talk feature, makes you feel like Dick Tracey, haha. I have edited this post, it does track sleep automatically, I just didn't know what I was doing. I love using it as a phone, to take or make calls. Everyone says it sounds great to them. Has plenty of watch faces to choose from.  I like the turning bezel and its other features, just needs some updating. Since I installed Android Wear on my phone, it will notify me of Google Now updates, such as traffic and whatever is in my cards.

I have the 3G version which included a SIM slot for its own cell line in case you wanted to detach it from your Samsung phone and use it as a standalone phone. Therefore, this review is mainly between these two watches.

First off, let's talk about the aspects where the original Gear S wins over the S3. The original Gear S is noticeable lighter, and feels more comfortable around your wrist, especially if you have smaller wrists. The curved design of the Gear S also makes it easier to see the watch face, and easier to use - your presses and swipes feel easier and more natural. I also like the band which comes with the Gear S, as it makes wearing it and taking it off a much simpler, faster, and easier process - I can pretty much wear and take off the Gear S in about 1 second, whereas it would take me about 2-3 seconds to take off the S3, and about 5 seconds to put it on because you have to hook it into the hole, and then slide the tongue underneathe the two holding bands.

However, I prefer the S3 in these areas: It feels faster and snappier to use. Also, since it has newer technologies, the apps that come with it feels more modern and robust. Tizen has come a long way since the very first original Gear, and although it still has a long ways to go, at least you can see some slight improvements. Ultimately though, I feel Tizen is taking too long to progress, and will soon be forgotten, or relegated to being a smart watch OS only, and not something that can be used on phones. The screen of the Gear S3 feels brighter and more colorful, no doubt the progression of Samsung's watch OLED technology. The rotating bezel and extra button on the S3 also make using the S4 easier, and gives it more functionality. Maybe it is just my watch, but I would like the bezel to rotate with more clamping force, as it feels too loose and easy to accidentally be moved. The watch face of the S3 looks and feels much more premium than the older S, as the metal parts make it look like a more expensive rugged watch, as opposed to the Gear S' more elegant 007/Dick Tracy spy watch style design. I also think the speaker on the S3 is just a tad louder than the Gear S. The S3 also has more and better watch faces than the Gear S.

In the end, I decided to keep both watches, for different occasions. The Gear S3 is my everyday watch, while the Gear S is more suited for a jog or something where you don't watch a big thick heavy watch to weigh you down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It does an okay job tracking my sleep. Sometimes it will record sleep whenever I'm sitting for long periods of time like at the movies.

Step count has been accurate, but battery life does not compart vs the 42 MM Samsung Gear Smart Watch.

First, it looks great. The face is customizable, albeit limited in its customization options. I personally prefer an analog chronograph face, so I'm currently using the Urban Classic one.  I just wish I could assign each individual complication, rather than select a firm set of three.

It's great for tracking steps and sleep, and serves as a second screen for messages and emails.  I like keeping my phone in my pocket during walks and still seeing my steps and messages on my wrist.

I really like how it auto-detects when I've been walking for 10 minutes and encourages me to ""keep it up,"" and automatically includes it in my day's exercise log.

One area where it really falls short is tracking stairs.  It doesn't track flights of stairs climbed with any consistency whatsoever.  Sometimes it will count a particular staircase once, twice, or not at all.  I've therefore learned to ignore this stat when viewing my Samsung Health goals.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have a very busy schedule and this watch paired with my phone is a great combination.  The watch has impressed me from the office to the gym and I have been using it daily.  Battery life is good with it lasting 3 days before charging and I try and use as many functions as it currently has (minus games).
The only negative I have with this watch is the lack of apps available and the voice commands could use some work as well.  I would love to see a better integration between music apps and the device with better control options and possibly an amazon music gear app and a Google music gear app.  For me the ability to selet different albums and Playlist from the gear frontier while running without having to reach for the phone would be a bonus.
If you are looking for a new smart watch this is definitely one to consider.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I went to amazon for the warranty support provided with the device for one year, and they instructed me to call the Samsung number. At this point I had done that and Samsung said the device was an international one, so Samsung is thus unable to service it. So, now I am sitting with a piece of scrap metal that costs almost $300, that is under warranty for a year and is unable to be fixed by Samsung and Amazon.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I get all my notifications on here. And in doing so, I do not have to worry about picking-up/getting out my phone.  Plus I can text with it with quick replies--which is always hugely convenient for me.  And I can also store music on here as well.  Good investment for my needs.  Granted, there are many other models of smartwatches out there and if you are price concerned you may want to consider them, but in all honesty, this watch cannot disappoint you.

However, I've since received confirmation that the product was indeed the new item that I was expecting and the shipping company (Kanga Supply) included the card as a means of contacting them. I very much appreciate their willingness to make contact easy, and they reached out very quickly to resolve the confusion. I would suggest that they modify their card to not indicate a refurbished status if that's not the case, but that is a very minor quarrel at this point. If you get a similar card, trust that they are shipping what you asked for, and contact them if there is a question.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So if you're stupid with your money, this is a great nothing to waste your money on. There is literally nothing practical that this thing offers if your phone is always in your pocket. The 1 review where the guy broke his arm and couldn't get to his phone was hilarious, but its not like he couldn't have moved to his phone with a broken arm. Trust me, I've done more with a broken leg. So.....if you have 200 bucks to blow on a novelty....don't. Donate it to the homeless.

So the ad I purchased did not clearly specify the model other then the name Frontier G3, and thus I do not have the LTE function and cannot connect directly to Verizon, and must use the WI-FI and Bluetooth functionality. This defeats the purpose of the watch, since I have to carry around my cell phone as well, and it draws heavily on the battery of the phone using all these services enabled.

I would appreciate it if Amazons sellers provide the proper details to help its customers make the correct decisions on these expensive products, as not all of us are rocket scientists and understand all the nuances of the tech world. On the other side, I do find the watch to be very attractive and new-age tech type. Its other feature are actually quite nice and make some operations very easy to perform. I especially like the Note feature which allows speech recognition instead of just typing, and it appears to be very accurate. I love the Samsung PAY feature, where you can just press and pay at local credit card machines in your favorite stores. It works almost everywhere.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/product-reviews/B01M7MDK5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought because it looks neat and secretly, I've always wanted to be a spy. This watch definitely does not have a flame thrower or a grappling hook attached but that won't detract a star. What it does have is seamless bluetooth connectivity with my Galaxy S9+, and the ability to still stay connected while my phone is connected to my car stereo. Noice!

It also has a sort of Pedometer thing, one of those features that health nuts use to track their foot steps. I was laying in bed watching YouTube videos and eating peanut butter M&Ms when I suddenly got a notification that said ""Good job, you walked 800 steps, keep it up!"" Or something to that effect. I was working out and getting health while not walking anywhere and shoving handfuls of M&Ms in my mouth! Another win!
