I thought that all was well. Then, I decided to look at my files on the drive just to make sure that things were operating as planned.

Big surprise!!! The files were formatted with a .bkup extension; not a jpeg or an mp3 anywhere. In addition the many hundred folders were suddenly about fifty files with unknowable files names of about 20, or so, letters and numbers.

I researched to find a way to open these files, hoping that I could salvage my purchase. The only answer I was able to find was fvp.exe, at a cost of $40.

So, are my files backed up? Technically, yes. Can I retrieve and use those files if my computer has a problem? No f_____ way. The Amazon presentation of this product was incomplete and mis-leading. Shame on them.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I transferred approx. 200GB of data and it took about an hour to write all the files to the hard drive. This drive is very fast, especially with the USB 3.0. I am so happy that I bought this item.

I like the USB 3.0 connection, particularly for transferring large files. My only complaint, and this is VERY minor, is that the top of the drive is slightly convex, so you can't stack them on top of each other.

Bought it for the sole purpose of backing up my Samsung 1TB computer.  Plugged it in via USB and all the installation instructions were easy to followed on my computer.  I bought the 3 TB at a nice price, with no hitches with the backup process and now feel a bit of comfort knowing that my files are safer.  This drive works with both 2.0 and 3.0 USB ports, obviously will download faster if you use a 3.0 hub.  My computer is 5 years old and I thought my USB ports were probably all 2.0 but turns out, I had one 3.0 USB so always good to check.  One tip is that 3.0 USB ports are blue in the female inside part of your computer.  So if you are not sure, check it out.  It does come with the necessary USB cable, 21 inches in length and a very limited instruction pamphlet.  The unit itself is very sleek looking, polished black that will show fingerprint smudges but small enough to wipe clean fairly easily.  Dimensions of the drive are 3"" x 4"" length and width and the thickness of the unit is 3/4 inches in depth, so a bit larger that a deck of paying cards.

This is an HDD (Hard Disk Drive) so I guess another decision for shoppers will be in deciding between either a Solid State Drive (SSD) or Hard Disk Drive (HDD).  If processing and overall speed of the external unit is key or if you are into gaming or audio or video production, you may want to consider the more efficient, faster and more expensive SSD Drives (solid state) that are out there.  Just saying that there are faster drives on the market but you will pay for it.  For my purposes, this Toshiba HDD is exactly what I needed at a reasonable price.

When powered up and on, there is a small, round blue Led light located on the front upper front of the unit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It comes with a USB cable.  Once plugged in, without downloading it's software, it was recognized as a drive in ""My Computer""  and ""File Manager.""  Therefore, I could simply start dragging files there instantly.

I then downloaded the software, by clicking its .exe file, and prompted for registration etc.

I opted to tell it what to back-up, and I will do it manually.  It takes a couple hours to back up 38 Gig the 1st time.

...or you could use it to back up your entire computer or operating system.

An added benefit is the USB cable also fits a Samsung Galaxy 5, so unplug your drive and plug in your phone to transfer phots etc using Kies3 etc.  ...or your phone shows up as a drive.

An added plus is that the other end of the USB cable fits my Galaxy 5 phone.

It DOES NOT come with the soft ware!!!!  ""It does not Plug in and run!""  You have to down load THE BACK-UP SOFTWARE!  i WENT ON TOSHIBA WEB SITE TO DOWNLOAD!  Using the link on the enclosed instruction slip, I went on line which turned out to be a sales page and this specific 2 TB was not listed .  I went all over the site looking for the down load including the support page.  Each time I entered the product and serial number, it was not recolonized. I called three numbers for support  and was only available Monday - Friday 8-5 but did not include these retail drives??.  This is the 2nd Toshiba drive I  bought in past 10 days because of the AUTO BACK_UP.  It is not Automatic, good luck with the download and hope you never need support.  be warned.
REVISED 9-3-19.  I WAS WRONG.  The external drives did come with built in  links ls to download back-up software although  the enclosed slip gave a link to download program which I attempted before installing the drive.  When discovered on installed drive, it did work and I was able  to install the back-up.  I am still working on Win. 10 install, frustrated ex-Win, 7 user!  I am up-grading my review to 4 stars because my support experience (Saturday) was not good, I can not give it a 5 star review.

The drive is very easy to install. It has been very durable so far. The USB 3.0 performance is as expected, and the drive is very quiet.
I give it 4 stars only because of the backup SW that is included. This SW is very basic, and doesn't allow the user any control over the backup. The SW supports only one backup job. It only performs incremental backups (I prefer differential backups), and it has no option to backup a system image. It does not have an option to encrypt the data with a passcode. This SW may be fine for most, but for users who want more control over their backup settings, I recommend using an advanced backup SW, such as BounceBack or Acronis.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Out of the box the device gave me an I/O error and failed operation on every file copy. I tried another usb 3 port, same result. I was in the process of returning it when I mentioned I bought this despite bad reviews due to decades of good experiences with Toshiba products and to upgrade my Canvio 500 gb which was still working great. That's when I thought to try that old Canvio's cable and voila, it worked copying a 33gb with zero errors, then two more smaller incremental backup files. And Amazon gave me a credit for the bad cable when I found I could buy a replacement on Amazon and get it the next day. So instead of swapping a defective product for another one Amazon suggested a deal that was faster and cost less for both of us. Toshiba support on the other hand wouldn't answer the phone for Amazon as we worked to resolve the problem.

I pulled it ""in and out"" of my bag, connecting and un-connecting it six times a day. I replaced the cords after they became frazzled. It was a workhorse until recently, when I detached the cord from the base and the metal connectors slid out from the base. This was a warning even though it still worked but I needed to more gently work with it. These little hints of mechanical vulnerability need to be listened to. So, I bought the new Toshiba 1 TB; it is noticeably faster accessing my data, smaller, lighter and more compact than the original. The price was right as well.

November 2017 Update: Be careful with the cable on these HDs as they are delicate and can go bad.

Just be aware of the mentioned caveat if using included software","December 27, 2017","I purchased this portable hard drive to replace an old desktop external hard drive which used an external power supply which I wanted to get rid of. This hard drive is way smaller than the other external hard drive that I was using before this one which is what I wanted. It came with an extremely short USB 3.0 cable which I did not like because it is too short for my needs as I am using this external hard drive to backup my desktop computer. Since the length of the USB cable did not suit my needs, I just use my USB cable from my Samsung Galaxy S6 phone and it works just as well.

This hard drive comes with NTI Backup Now EZ 4 which allows you to create a complete system backup as well as a file and folders backup jobs. The included backup software works well but there is one caveat which I have come across. When making a files and folder backup which include files with a file extension that the software does not have listed in its list of file extensions for different file types, the backup will not include the files that have an extension that is not listed in the list of file extensions for the different file types. I had 22 pictures of which 10 have an extension of .jpg and the other 12 had the extension of .jpeg. Since the extension .jpeg was not in the list of file extensions for picture files, my pictures which had have the extension of .jpeg did not get backed up. Fortunately, I was able to discover this and the solution is simple. The solution is to add the extensions to the list of file extensions that are not in the list. Doing so will get the files backed up. You can also use any other backup software you chose as you are not limited to using the backup software it comes with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Update 17-November-2019

This drive began to fail a two months ago. The symptoms are a drastic read/write slowdown of 50% on partitions near the end of the drive and intermittent I/O errors. It appears that the designers have made error-correcting firmware that silently conceals hardware failures.

Outside Amazon's and Toshiba's warranty periods, so I'm SOL.

The drive is garbage and the corporate philosophy behind aims to deceive. Please do not buy.
-----------------------------------------------
Original review...

For reading and writing small files, transfer rates measure about .5 MB/s and .3 MB/s. It seems to have an onboard buffer that makes the transfer rate appear much higher until the buffer fills. Once the buffer fills, the rate slows down drastically. It continues to write for a minute or so even after any write operations complete on the computer side. Transfer rates for large, sequential files are typical for a 5400 rpm 2.5"" drive.

I contacted Toshiba support in an attempt to find out the drive's normal operation. Their non-response: ""We do not have the read write speed information for external hard drives."" How about that? The manufacturer will not disclose to customers the actual specs of their own product! The specs sheet states ""Up to 5 Gb/s"", which is simply the maximum speed of USB 3. Marketing mis-direction at its very finest.

On the plus side, the drive is small, convenient, and elegant in appearance. And it has not failed after several months of use. Just don't expect its performance to match its presentation and marketing.

The drive can be connected to either USB 2 or USB 3.  The case light turns blue for USB 3 vs. white for USB 2. Connected via USB 3, initial transfer speed are much higher, again only until its internal buffer fills. After that, the USB type does not matter because the sustained transfer rate is far below USB 2 speeds.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have bought two of them for my wife's MacBook and four for my Windows laptop. Yes, four is probably a bit excessive but if you only have one backup drive you really don't have reliable backup; I have never had a hard drive that did not fail eventually.  That being said, all six of mine, four 1 TB and two 2 TB, are still working, some for at least three years.  Installation consists of plugging it into one of your computer's USB ports; that's it, consider it installed.

We have 72 games downloaded with less than 50% space used, including nearly every call of duty and halo with all map packs and additional downloads..  I purchased this initially because the last external drive we purchased started failing after 5 years..  (It was not the same drive.. I don't know how long this one will last)  I can say that after the headache of the constant game stops and failures to download it was time for a new drive and so far this one works flawlessly..  I'll update if the device fails sooner than expected..

I do like that this one does not require an additional power source... Only one cord between the 2 devices.. It's much smaller than the previous one we purchased as well...  I no longer have to pack his console to visit family.. we only need to take this and plug it into a relatives console to play games..  However you can only download games from the device it was formatted to..  We have 2 consoles, one wired to the router an the other uses wifi..  Obviously the one wired to the router had faster download speeds so I tried to just move the drive to my console to download games and it was a no go..

I am impressed with how cool it runs; it does not get hot like my older 2010 model external hdds.  I am also impressed with how lightweight it is, and I also like the shape of it and that it is pretty small.  It's also nice that it is plug and play and does not require a separate power source.  I glanced at the NTI backup software and the PogoPlay cloud data access software but did not use it yet since Windows backup handles my backup needs and plugging the drive into the usb port on my router handles my cloud data access needs.  To note, the user interface of the NTI backup software is nice looking and easy to use.  When I used the drive to take a system image of my mom's new laptop, the data transfer rate was averaging ~110MBps since her laptop has usb 3.0 capability.  At home I only have usb 2.0 so my speeds are just ~10MBps which is to be expected.  The light on it is white and blinks during data transfer, but it is not intrusive or anoying at all in my opinion.  I like this drive a lot and am probably going to buy 1 or 2 more.  The Amazon Basics external hard drive case I got with it as a free gift is also awesome.

The installation was quick and easy, it comes with a USB 3.0 compatability, and I get about 1.86 Tb of space.

However, after using it for a few weeks, I have noticed a few awfully annoying things that I have never noticed with my Seagate or WD models. First, whenever I go back on a video file and come to the point I was when I went back, the video ALWAYS pauses. It seems to be quite a common problem because my mother's Toshiba hard drive does the same thing, and I have never had any issues in the past decade with Seagate or WD models.

Also, at least in the case of my specific unit, I was moving some files to my mother's desktop and decided to rearrange my files while I was there. When I brought it back to my laptop, it detected a problem with the device and requested to fix it. The fix was annoying, but thankfully, nothing was deleted. However, it happened a few more times whenever I went between different computers. Both my mother's desktop and my laptop are Windows-based systems. The only difference is I'm running Windows 8 and she is running Windows 7.

With just these two annoyances, I'm a bit reluctant to repurchase another external hard drive from Toshiba any time soon. I'll hold onto the one I purchased for now, because I need it and the problems have just been annoyances thus far, but I don't quite recommend this unit if you can find one from Seagate or WD for around the same price point.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I attempted no less than 5 times to upload each file one at a time.... and the harddrive would magically eject at some random moment.

The base does not have the anti-slip pads like my WD Digital, that's a shame.
So far, It's working, I read some reviews of this failing so I was a little worried but time will tell and I'll make sure to update this review.
Checking on internet they say Toshiba has less probability of failure than WD. I have owned 5 WD hard drives, internal and externals that have been working so great so far after the years. This is the first Toshiba.

The purpose of this HDD is as a redundant backup, the very first hard drive I bought was a WD (not considered in the list of I have own), I copied all my stuff there and first fall stopped working and all the information is gone. Unfortunately, this is the truth these days that you always need to have a second backup in case one fails, that means another device and another expense but that's the only way to make sure your information is safe.

What I don't like is that It seems that there is no customer support from Toshiba at all from the reviews. Different from buying a WD, they are customer oriented and that is well worth it 10 extra dollars for the 2 TB WD version.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have to send in the replacement at my cost and in 5-7 weeks they'll send me a visa card with an amount on it based on their valuation. And the packing instructions are extremely strict forcing additonal packing costs . So I'm out 52.45 for the unit, about a $1 for packing materials and 7.15 for the shipping an maybe just maybe I'll get a gift card in 5-7 weeks from now at a yet to be determined value.

It is not capable of flying!! Yup because Its a Reliable External Hard Drive :)","September 5, 2017","One word that describes it - ""Reliable"". This is my preferred brand of external hard drive. It comes well packed and is easy to setup...just plug and play. I also like the fact that it does not heat up when you are transferring data between the Hard Drive and your laptop or computer. Having USB 3.0 helps as data transfer is faster.

It also comes with a backup software (NTI) which is simply crappy :), especially the scheduler. Sorry Toshiba..hey but that's a free Software and I didn't buy your hard drive knowing that you have this free Software included. Even if you don't provide the software, your hard drive is still the best.
Don't get me wrong people, if you are not very organized (don't file your documents, pictures systematically), this Software will be helpful. On the other hand if you are very organized, you know exactly what to backup and it will be quick without the software.

Another thing is the life of the drive. It should last for many years but you need to make sure you don't abuse it and keep it in a reliable case.
Also, make sure that it is not the only source of your backup. I keep two back-ups of my critical data.

I have posted the unboxing video for this harddrive and case for this harddrive.
You can look for the following on youtube: ""Unboxing & Usage of Toshiba Canvio Connect II & Amazonbasics external hard drive case"".

Just turn on your Xbox and plug in the HDD after, always insert the HDD with the system on, format and will be ready to install games, the system recognize the new device automaticly and prompt you the option to format it. I had bad experiences with Seagate HDD's in the past, so i promise to myself dont buy any other again, since then i switched to Toshiba, i have several HDD from them now, mostly external and none ever fail. In my opinion Toshiba is the greatest solution when is about mechanical HDD's. 2TB for just $60 will let you storage an average of 50 to 70 games, more than enough to me. Totally recomend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have been using it for photos, including RAW files (which are much larger than JPG's), and I've had no issues with file storage, fidelity, or retrieval speeds.
  The hard drive itself is slightly larger than a deck of cards, and comes with one cord which connects to a USB port on your computer or device.  This size and simplicity make it very portable, and unobtrusive even on a small desk.  It has a small light that comes on when it is running a task, which I liked, because physical cues are nice when you first get an item and wanting to know if it is working properly. The drive does make a whisper of a noise, but it is still very quiet (the fans on many computers are noisier than this drive), and it is only intermittent, not a constant noise.
  Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase, and based on my experience, have already recommended this product to friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Two things to know about this device when using it with the Xbox one.  When using the hard drive for the first time, make sure you have your Xbox one turned on first and that you are logged on to your account.  If you have the hard drive plugged in when turning on the Xbox one (for the first time), it will not recognize the drive.  It didn't work for me.  After 10 minutes of useless research and cursing, I was about to pack it up and send it back to Amazon.  So I decided one last try..... I unplugged it, turned on my Xbox one, logged into my account and then I plugged the hard drive in and VICTORY!  The XB1 recognized the drive and two quick clicks later, it was ready to go.

Second, after moving 12 games over to the hard drive, I turned off the XB1.  Next day when I turned on my XB1 with the hard drive still plugged in, there was nothing on my hard drive (external).  It showed that I had items saved onto the drive but, I could not see any games.  First thought, another worthless hard drive!  But, before I threw it against the wall (not really) I unplugged hard drive and plugged it back into the XB1 and everything was there.  So, ever since this issue, I have unplugged the hard drive and plugged it back in after turning on the XB1.  Maybe I had a glitch but, up to you.

Moving along now....

I bought mine for $81 (brand new) from Amazon. I was lucky.  Right now, it is going for $119.  It says 2GB but, after I formatted it for the XB1 and ran it for the first time, it has 1.8TB for actual use.  Its power source is the device it is plugged in too.  It appears to be sturdy and well made.  I like the tiny little cushions on the bottom of the hard drive that prevents it from sliding around.  It comes with a 3.0 usb type-A/micro type-b cable.  This cable is SHORT and very thin.  The end that goes into the hard drive, in my opinion, is a little unstable for me (it felt like it would come out it you it around).  There is a solution for this issue but, you will have to pay extra cash.  After doing much research on portable hard drives, a lot of folks have had this issue (not only on Amazon but, elsewhere).  So, I bought a two-pack, from Cable Matters, of 3.0 usb type-A/micro-b cables.  They are 3 feet long, THICKER and they fit into the hard drive and XB1 like they SHOULD be, SNUG.  This will save you time.  Why?  Because you will end up talking to the Toshiba and requesting for another cable.  In my opinion.

Games being moved from the internal hard drive to the external hard drive will vary in the time it takes to move it.  The largest game moved was 48.8 GB and it took just under 14 minutes.  Moving games back is slightly faster.  As for playing games from the external hard drive, there might be a quicker load time as compared to the internal drive but, as far as I am concerned, it works.  The only thing I have not done is to download a game from Microsoft directly onto my external drive.  I haven't set up that option yet.  Last thing when it comes to downloads, transfers, etc. I downloaded Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag (free) and it took 3 hours.  Transfer to the external from the internal took 7 minutes plus.

My rating it 4 may or may not change over the course of this device.  No electronic device gets a 5-star or a 1-star rating.  5-star, to me, means that it is perfect, no such thing.  1-star means it dies tomorrow or within a year.

Overall, great, for now as it pertains to the XB1.  The company says it is compatible with Windows 7, 8, 8.1.  Well, Windows 10 is about to be released and I will wait before I buy an external hard drive as a back-up.  This is a very, very quite external hard drive, simple as that.  You want noise?  The power source for XB1 is louder, HOURS after it has not been in use.  Go figure.  As of now, it is a great external hard drive for the XB1 (minus the cable.  Trust me, buy the cable I mentioned earlier or something similar.  A great or good sturdy cable makes all the difference in the world).

Last words, my review will change if the drive has issues.  I don't plan on moving mine around unless it is to be cleaned.  I also, DO NOT, work for Toshiba, Amazon, Microsoft, Cable Matters, any blog site, etc.  I am just a consumer who was looking for an external hard drive for my XB1.  I DO NOT KNOW how this device will work on a laptop, computer, PS4 or mobile phone.  That will be up to you.

PS - I have owned this item for less then a week and it was bought through Amazon.

PSS - Just because a device says 1TB, 2TB, 3TB, etc. IT DOES NOT MEAN IT HAS THAT AMOUNT OF SPACE AVAILABLE!  Why?  Software that comes with the device.  This is for the folks who always have this complaint..... Avoid this issue and RESEARCH BEFORE BUYING!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought the 3 TB at a nice price, with no hitches with the backup process and now feel a bit of comfort knowing that my files are safer. This drive works with both 2.0 and 3.0 USB ports, obviously will download faster if you use a 3.0 hub. My computer is 5 years old and I thought my USB ports were probably all 2.0 but turns out, I had one 3.0 USB so always good to check. One tip is that 3.0 USB ports are blue in the female inside part of your computer. So if you are not sure, check it out. It does come with the necessary USB cable, 21 inches in length and a very limited instruction pamphlet. The unit itself is very sleek looking, polished black that will show fingerprint smudges but small enough to wipe clean fairly easily. Dimensions of the drive are 3"" x 4"" length and width and the thickness of the unit is 3/4 inches in depth, so a bit larger that a deck of paying cards.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm unable to run Time Machine and there seems to be no way around it so this otherwise very compact and nice-seeming drive is probably going to have to be returned. Such a waste of my time.
Update**: My rad husband was able to reformat this thing to exFAT on his Windows PC. So much for no reformatting, but the backup seems to be happening.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When working with some files I had a few issues with the files bringing in shortcuts with them (which made a bit of a mess on the drive) but I'm not certain that it was an issue with the hard drive itself; that was more likely user error.

I installed it in an external drive case and it's connected to one of my computer's USB3 port. I installed macOS 10.14.2 Mojave on it in two partitions. One contained a clone of my main Sierra system. The other is a utility disk with Mojave and various disk utilities. Though many are not yet optimized for Mojave. In any case the system runs very fast. Of course people with laptop computers may already be familiar with SSD performance, it's new to me. My main computer is a 27"" iMac with a Fusion Drive.

So, my Fusion Drive is much faster than the HDDs in my old Mac Pro. And this SSD is comparatively faster still. So I'm a happy camper. Of course I can't speak to it's durability as I've only had it for a little while. As for versatility, I can pretty much use it any way I want. Buying the bare drive and an inexpensive drive case saved me at least $50 compared to an external SSD. I recommend it.

I give it a 3 star, because it was working fine until the issue, but I wasn't happy with Toshiba's final decision. It was the final decision that swayed me to even write this review. I called customer service once and went thru the issue, but then when I thought it was resolved, heard or saw nothing come in the mail. I had to call customer service at Toshiba a second time and they tried to assist me again. Unfortunately the final result was I couldn't get my personal information off of the device and the only way to get a gift card at the value of the hard drive, was to return it. I didn't feel comfortable sending back a hard drive that had all my information on it to some random company even if they stated they would destroy the device. So after all the work trying to figure out what to do, I decided to drop the warranty of getting another device. If they know the product is malfunctioning, the company should allow me to drill the hole in the device send it to them and get the gift card. That too was a surprise that I get a gift card instead of another device, but that was a small issue compared to the fact that I lost my information and the final result was I had to decide not to bother with the warranty after several phone conversations and emails.  Needless to say, I will not get another Toshiba device.","3.0 out of 5 stars","",""

The spinning speed I believe is 5400rpm so it's not the fastest drive on the market but the USB3 interface makes for fast data transfer.  It's compact and fits easily into the carrying bag I have to carry my computer in.

Used it once to store my personal files.  This evening (mid January) I wanted to check again as to how much free space I have as I am planning on upgrading my computer to a SSD along side of the HDD installed, using the external HD for back up when I do a clean install.  I had the drive in it's box it arrived in and had placed it in a drawer of my desk.  The drive was not dropped, nor shaken.  Plugged it in and blue light came on and kept flashing.  I was unable to eject the HD and my File Explorer was also affected.  Looked on line to see if there were any solutions to fix.  Most advised to take it out of it's container but I did not do so as I felt this might void the warranty.

This drive died 68 days after delivery. Too late for a return, too late for product support from the manufacturer, too late to recover my lost files. I went through three recovery programs to find that it is not a file issue rather the drive itself has stopped working. Sometimes it spins, other times it makes a loud noise. It never hit the ground, it was never physically damaged it is just poorly made and the lack of support is really disappointing. I would say if you are going to try this you should probably hold off on putting anything you cannot lose on the drive, but if that's the case why would you be buying this in the first place?

It arrived according to Amazon specifications. Toshiba Canvio Connect II 1TB Portable Hard Drive started working as promised. The installation and setup is pretty simple.

I did a quick backup just to test. I always use my own creation: The best, easiest, fastest backup based on a simple batch file (totally free). Read this page on how you too can create the best backup software: http://saliu.com/best-backup.html

Next step was an important step: Full backup, the counterpart of ‘Create system image’ in Windows. The NTI software that came with my Toshiba Canvio did the system image backup twice as fast as the Windows function.

Now, I had expected the Canvio with the system image to be a BOOTABLE CLONE. That’s what I read in customer reviews before I bought the Toshiba Canvio. It is NOT the case. The system image is only bootable, but not a clone. Was I wrong, or some customer reviews were misleading?

I have no complaints about Toshiba Canvio, only about the NTI software that was bundled with the device. It has two annoying fixtures:

1) It says to ‘Activate software’. When I click, the program turns to a black screen and several Windows error messages.

2) It says ‘Create bootable USB drive’ but it does NOT work. After the progress bar reaches 100%, the final message reads ‘Failed to create bootable device’. Even worse, the drive disappears from the list of drives for my PC. I have to reformat it again, and again…

Anyone else experienced the same issues with NTI Backup Now EZ 4? Can anyone illuminate or help me? Thank you.

My overall ratings:
Toshiba Canvio Connect II 1TB Portable Hard Drive: 9 (out of 10)
NTI Backup Now EZ 4: 4 out of 10.
Pogoplug PC: Of no use to me.

I works great and is quite fast","August 7, 2016","5/17/18 UPDATE.  Sadly, this drive died just 29 months after purchase, which of course is outside of the 2 year warranty.  I am very disappointed that it died so quickly after the warranty ran out.  I have many drives that are still running after almost 10 years of daily service and only had a 2 year warranty.  Luckily for us, it was only used for portable use of files and not for backup.  Needless to say, I won't be buying another one of this brand and model again.
original post - Bought it for my wife's business, so she can have a copy of her important files with her when she travels.  New laptops don't normally have huge hard drives in them for file storage, so this fits the bill nicely.  I works great and is quite fast.  I paired it with a real time sync program and it works like a champ to keep her files always up to date on this drive.  Also got a carrying case with it, which I would strongly recommend for protection.  I would definitely buy this and recommend it to others.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

 I had it two weeks. I am not even touching the drive or near my computer and I get DISK NOT EJECTED PROPERLY errors. Sometimes while connected the drive disappears from the computer (Finder on my Mac) but continues to appear to operate.

The Warranty is USELESS. This is a portable drive and I am traveling outside the United States. They won't even replace the drive or the cable. They want me to pay the return freight and they'll mail me a Visa Gift Card after they get the drive back. I don't want a Visa Gift Card, I want a working Hard Drive. One that is manufactured to rigid quality control standards by employees paid more than ten cents an hour for their labor.

This drive is manufactured in the Philippines. I have much lower confidence in products made in the Philippines when compared to China, Vietnam, or Korea. A Japanese company, Toshiba, and they cannot even manufacture in their own country.

The drive can't cost them more than $20 to manufacture. My expectation is they advance exchange and air freight a replacement drive (one that has had more extensive quality control) anywhere in the world 2 day service. Inside the box is a PREPAID return shipping label to get their old one back. Or just tell me to send the old one to the dump and use it for landfill.

I am a heavy user of externals and i need as much storage as possible but yo boi aint rolling in Scrooge McDuck monies.

Click of Death for NO Reason","November 27, 2018","This was good for the first few months. I used the external hard drive as a backup drive for my Mac along with extra storage since it was 2TB and my mac only has 256 GB. It worked well, I plugged it in when I use my Mac at home and SAFELY eject the drive before unplugging it because I knew it could cause damage to it otherwise. However, today upon writing this review the drive glitched up and my mac notified me saying ""Toshiba was not properly ejected"" and then this ""click of death"" came upon it randomly. I don't understand how it came to be because I haven't done anything with this hard drive to cause such an issue.

UPDATE*:
That issue was due to a lack of power needed to start the drive.

I tried modifying the UAC settings, but it didn't help. A lot of users say that they have encountered similar issues with NTI software. This is an ongoing issue that hasn't been taken care of in a very long time (years). It virtually renders the backup software unusable and I am not willing to pay extra to buy another backup software suite separately. I have contacted Toshiba and NTI to get help with these issues.
The drive itself seems nice.

Luckily I used to own a Samsung S5 so I have several of those unusual cables left that are USB 3 compliant. For what I need and the price you can't go wrong.

Sometimes, when connecting the hard drive, the security software won't start automatically.
If I try to run it manually, it will open just to say that it can't work ""because the required service program has not started.""  It gives no hint about what services should I look for or anything.  So I'm getting stuck without access to my files.

I would regularly backup my computer, usually on thumb drives. Eventually, I got to the point that I could not find thumb drives that had enough space on them to backup all of my files. Add to that the fact that my computer was starting to have issues, so it was even more important that I create backups. That is why I ordered this external, portable hard drive. I can say, without a doubt, that it is one of the best purchases I have ever made. When I received it, all I had to do was connect the USB cable to the hard drive, plug it into my computer, and I was good to go. With its capacity of 1T, there is just about no limits to how much I can save. I have even unplugged it from one computer and immediately plugged it into another computer I own, and it works seamlessly. In addition, with the free PogoPlug PC software, I can access (upload and download) content from all/any devices. Even though it comes in many colors, I chose gloss black to match my other electronic items. It is the size of a deck of cards and fits nicely in a shirt pocket or in a pocket in my purse. I feel much better now that my data is safely backed-up, and would recommend this external and portable hard drive to anyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I do voice over work and needed to store back up copies of large audio projects. I researched several models before deciding on the Toshiba Canvio Connect.  I paid full price (ok, my boss reimbursed me, so technically my boss paid full price) and it is worth every penny.

So far I love everything about this hard drive.  The drive is small and super portable.  It weighs about 8oz and it measures just over 4 inches by 3 inches by less than one inch.  You can easily tuck into your jacket pocket or backpack.  (I bought a case for it for extra protection, so in practice the drive is a little bulkier than its direct measurements).  But you don’t have to transport it, because with a minimum amount of work, you can access it remotely!

Here are the really great things that convinced me on this Toshiba external drive:
1.  Cloud-based automatic backup.  Super easy and secure.  You don’t have to think about it, just set it up and let it do its thing.
2.  Password protected data encryption.  I’m pretty sure no hacker is going to try to steal my voice overs, but my boss is paranoid about security.
3.  Content sharing.  There is a free software download that lets you connect and upload / download from other devices.  This is really good because my co workers are scattered all over and we all have home offices.  My boss and coworkers can access my work  product even if I’m not available to send it to them.
4.  Plug and play.  The drive is  formatted and ready to go when you receive it.  If all you want is a simple, no bells and whistles external drive, then you don’t need to do any of the cloud stuff.  Just plug in the drive and you are done.
5.  Two Terabytes.  No kidding.  I remember when one gigabyte was huge.  It’s gonna take a while to fill this up.
6.  It's red.  I love red.  It is easier to find in the bottom of your bag or in a pile of clutter on your desk.  Plus red just makes me  happy.
7.  It runs fast and it runs cool.  I routinely back up 10GB projects with no fuss, muss, or hassle.  I just copy, paste, and boom my file is backed up and I'm back in business.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

- Needs no power cable
- Works with Windows XP
- Small, light and silent
- A Terabyte for $50

Cons:
- Short proprietary cable
- Cluttered root with Toshiba files

These small drives have progressed a great deal. My past drives either needed a wall wart or two USB cables. I used this on two old Windows XP PC's, including a laptop, using a single USB 2 port, no problems. I transferred ~60 GB having thousands of folders and files in about an hour. Not fast by USB 3 standards but I was very pleased.

The root of drive was cluttered with Toshiba files, I transferred all of them to a new folder (Toshiba). Toshiba should have shipped the drive like this. I dislike any files at the root, only folders.

The drive cable end is unlike any I've ever seen before, don't lose the supplied cable, highly unlikely you'll ever find another like it.

If I had to recommend as a computer technician whether to buy laptop or desktop-sized external hard drives, I'd go with the former. The laptop drives are designed for travel and have a bit of tolerance for turbulence. Desktop drives are meant to stay in one place and move very infrequently, not to mention discourage portability with their bulkiness and power via power outlet.

This external came with some ""cloud"" software brand new, but I haven't messed with it at all. It works much like you'd expect if you've used these things before. You plug it in, your operating system sees it and does what it can to allow you to manipulate the data on the device.

Just make sure that you have a second one to backup your stuff to or use cloud storage for the most critical of data. It helps when I follow my own advice too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews"

In terms of size and looks, this is a winner.
In terms of speed, I've used it with USB 3.0 in my laptop and it was pretty fast.
If you need a hard drive to carry work around or as a backup, this seems to fit the bill pretty well.
My experience with hard drives is that you cannot tell in advance how well they will hold over time, so I have nothing to say with respect to reliability.

Update: my sister needed to be able to transfer files between a Mac and a Windows PC. In order to do that, you will have to re-format the drive as it comes formatted with a format that is not writeable on a Mac. The format you need is ExFAT, and  from what I have read, it needs to be done on a Windows PC or it will not be compatible on both sides. To format the drive, connect it to a windows PC and do the following:
1) Open up Windows Explorer and right-click on your drive in the sidebar. Choose ""Format"".
2) In the ""File System"" dropdown, choose exFAT instead of NTFS.
3) Click Start and close this window when finished.
Your drive should now be usable on Mac and PC without limitations!

UPDATE: Some comments after reading other reviews. Hope this helps you...
* NEVER use a single hard drive as a backup. They fail unpredictably! I've had hard drives that worked for years and others that broke quickly. The same manufacturer can have batches with different quality. If you are going to be using a hard drive like this to backup your files, I suggest getting more than one.
* Don't use cheap backup software included with a hard drive. Use Time machine on MacOS or Windows file history on Windows. They work well and are free. If your needs are more complicated, then look at the first bullet and buy better backup software.
* For photos and videos, besides backing them up on a hard drive, I upload them to Google Photos (free) and Amazon Prime photos (free with prime for photos only). These are very important for me, so I like having extra copies.
* For music, you can backup your library using iTunes backup (if you have it on iTunes) for $25/year.
* For other important documents, you should use a cloud drive for backup. Unless you do specialized work, the rest of your data should not be that big.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

What more can you ask for?  It arrived before the promised time, was easy to hookup, my computer recognized it right away and was ready to start backing up right away.

I have not tried the included software as my immediate need is just for portable storage/backup.  I am using the Windows 10 backup option but prefer Synctoy from Microsoft as it allows ""in the clear"" back ups so I can just access the drive and find my backed up files.  Will switch to that soon.

I think one of the bundled applications allows a full image backup in addition to file backups.  May explore that later.

Some portion of Pogoplay apparently is going away, but was not a selling point for me, one way or another.  If you need the faux-cloud functionality, you may want to read more about Pogoplay's plans for ongoing support.

I think the only updates are for Windows 8 as that's the only one I saw. I plugged this in and it immediately loaded up the drivers and started working. I love that it does NOT have an on/off switch but just automatically shuts off when not used for a few minutes. It also automatically turns on when used. They loaded the guarantee and software update site right on this unit so you don't have to search for anything. It measures 3X4 inches and is about 3/8 inch thick. I bought a 6 foot cord so I could easily hook it into my tower without worrying about cord length. The cord I bought is- Cable Matters Micro USB 3.0 Cable (Micro USB 3 Cable A to Micro B) in Blue 6 Feet. I only have USB 2 connections and this also works without any problems. Plus it's blue and easily identifiable from all the others I have plugged into the back of my tower. All in all seems like a great device and so far I am very happy. UPDATE: 8/2/19. I took a star off because this unit performs slowly sometimes. Although you can search the box forever there is nothing said about being solid state or disc hard drive. It seems it is a standard disc drive because you can hear the disc cranking up. Be nice if they were just up front about it. I will use this until it dies and then get a SSD to replace it as that's what I wanted to begin with.

Worked fine directly connected to USB 3 ports on two Windows 7 notebooks I have.
Unfortunately my target device was not Windows. As a standards based USB device using NTFS there is no theoretical reason it is not plug and play anywhere those devices can connect. Well, it was not recognized at all by the pogoplug storage server where I needed it.
Internet search for help produced lots of feedback to people with Macs who had struggled, but the only Toshiba site help request similar to mine had gone unanswered for over a year. So I guess I will just ebay mine or save it for some Windows-specific project.
In fairness... it is cheap. If you want it for Windows, go for it!
As a side note, there is no useful documentation included with the drive. (well, since is should be plug-and-play USB, why would documentation be needed?) But Toshiba has placed some software on the drive for you to load on your Windows box. There is no ""readme"" or other indication about the purpose of the software. (As I have said, on Windows you don't need any software to use it).
I thought that perhaps starting the ""setup"" executable would display some sort of banner or message to indicate software's purpose.
Nothing.

Tech support took days to first get back to me, then was quick to respond.

So first I requested a replacement. It suffers from the same problem, and only one digit in the serial number was different. Same batch.

Five minutes later saw it plugged into a USB hub. Examining the drive in window$ explorer I saw that it was the correct advertised capacity.

Pros: Small, light weight, mostly red, and includes an 18""? USB 3.0 cable. Included on the HDD its self is the ""Declaration of Conformity"", and the ""Two (2) Year Standard Warranty"", both pdf files. Plus a link to download their Backup and Password protection software. File transfer back and forth to a Note Book Computer with a USB 3.0 port was very fast. And no, I didn't measure it. Same file transfer test using the same computer and it's USB 2.0 port was noticeably slower. Once it hasn't been accessed in about 12? minutes or so it spins down and goes into a standby mode. That will help extend it's useful life.

Cons: So far nothing.

Other thoughts: I only bought the red version because it was the least expensive color at the time. I did add small stick on rubber feet to the bottom of it so it doesn't slide around on a hard surface. This HDD has more than enough capacity to serve it's intended function as a NAS device. And so far it has been functioning correctly as of today.

I won't speak to durability yet as I haven't owned it for the full warranty period.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Please see the attached screen copy. There is no HELP desk phone that I can call so I got to wait about one week later to do some research about it. Now I found in the HELP and found out the system requirements are for Window 8.1, 8, 7, Vista, & XP. I have Windows 10 and that may be the problem for not allowing to back up the PC.  BAD software that is not update to date. In other words, this backup product is useless for Windows 10 users.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Setting it up to use was very easy (simple reformat for Mac) and it was relatively fast for the price.  In September, the drive started clicking.  In a couple of days, it began to fail (stopped writing, kept locking up, etc).  I figured it was just an anomaly, so I ordered another and accepted the loss.  I received the 2nd drive the next day on Amazon (end of September).  I transferred all of the data from the other failing drive and began using the new one for backup and storage.  Today is Nov 16th (less than 2 months later), and this drive is having the exact same issue (clicking, fails when trying to save files, locking up, etc).  I ran the Mac Disk Utility on it several times, and I get a message that indicated the drive could not be unmounted.  I've worked with enough external hard drives to know it is about to fail.  I just ordered a Western Digital MyPassport to replace this one.  If that one fails, then I will update this review - assuming the problem is not the drives.  But the clicking noises are usually a pretty good sign that something isn't right.  I certainly would never trust a hard drive backup that had clicking noises - especially when they correlate with demonstrable read/write issues.  I'm no expert - but that has been my experience.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Every Toshiba product I have had has been reliable and had outlived similar products of other brands I have seen my friends have. It does exactly what I need it to do. It's reasonably small and slim, it operates virtually silently, doesn't get hot, and I expect it to keep being what I need it to be beyond me filling it up an either needing a second one, or a bigger one.

TL;DR: don't expect this drive to be able to copy a full 64gb SD card at full speed, unless it's sitting on a heatsink in front of a fan.

I'm seeing ~130MB/s for large file read, and ~60MB/s for large file writes, but after 10-20GB of writes, the case heats up, and I/O speeds drop to under 1MB/s, presumably due to internal heat and poor thermal management firmware. This is in a fairly cold room, btw: ambient is ~65F.

I had to put the drive in front of a fan, and pause writes every minute, for a minute, before I saw stable throughput speeds from the drive.

User","What You Need to Know About Portable Hard Drives","November 9, 2019","There's a lot of nonsense in the reviews, so I'm going to give you some facts. Feel free to do some research to verify what I'm saying. This is already a wall of text so I won't go into too much detail.
1) EVERY hard drive manufacturer has failures. EVERY last one. Some are DOA, some take a month or more. It depends on your use. You've heard of 6-Sigma? That's about 3.4 failures per million. Do the math.
1b) Any drive you research (unless it was just released) will have more bad reviews than good. Why? Because people are more likely to complain than praise.
1c) Smaller manufacturers get bought out by larger ones. Last year's high-end product may now harbor a low-end drive. Seriously. CYA. Find manufacturers you trust and give them your loyalty.
2) Every USB hard drive, thumb drive, etc. works on Windows, Mac and Linux. There are a few specialty proprietary devices, especially for professional and enterprise equipment, but consumer equipment works on both. Reformat it if you need to. Check it on all your devices before using it (technical reasons).
2b) ExFAT is the usual suspect for cross-platform file sharing. It's not great. It has nothing to hinder data loss (like journaling) and, in my experience, Macs sometimes choke on it. Consider a reputable cross-platform file driver and stick with NTFS or HFS+. Check your drive on all the platforms before using it (technical reasons). If you're using it for backups, only use it for backups. If it's for TimeMachine on a Mac, let TimeMachine reformat it and take it over completely.
2c) Check the options when you buy it and check again in your cart. There are multiple sizes, styles and ""support"" options. Make sure you're ordering what you think you are. Seriously. I've seen plenty of reviews by people who are really complaining that they ordered the wrong thing. And watch the price when you change options. Check it again in the cart before you check out.
3) Don't move your data – copy it. And save your old drive until your sure the new one is good. Feel free to abuse your new device, perform surface scans, etc. as often as you want when you get it. It's called a burn in. If the drive's mechanics are good, software will watch for failing sectors later (look up S.M.A.R.T.).
3b) SSDs don't need scans and should not be defragged. It's actually bad for them.
4) Get an online backup service, preferably a reputable one with a zero-knowledge policy, like SpiderOak or Carbonite. That means the provider can't access your data even if they wanted to. It's called security. Hang on to your old drive until your files finish backing up (in case of a failure). Depending on your service, it may not take very long. (Some services check your data to avoid uploading the same data twice.)
5) Electronic equipment, no matter how rugged or solid-state it claims to be, no matter what the ads say, is not intended to be dropped, sat on, magnetized, electrocuted, submerged, burned, microwaved, or implanted into living beings. It's certainly not meant to be thrown, left in the rain, dropped in the pool, etc. You do that and it breaks. You lose data. (Products actually intended for this behavior are expensive. Water resistant is not submersible. Submersible has limits. Shock resistant does not mean it's ok to drop it.)
6) Don't use the included backup software, backup service, or built-in password protection. You are not paying for these things. If they were that good, they would be sold independently. If they are, what you have is an ad designed to trick you into using a service you won't bother to cancel. Get your own service. (See #4.)
6b) The first thing you should do is reformat the drive, even if it came formatted. It doesn't take long. Just do it.
7) Portable is good, but if your laptop comes with an external mouse and keyboard, two external drives, a hub... it's not portable anymore. SD cards are pretty cheap and more durable for travel. They're also faster. Keep your drive safe and bring copies. Unless, of course you need a lot of space. In that case get a second drive and bring copies. If your data is that important, protect it.
8) Think of the stupidest person at your job and assume that every review is written by them. Seriously, I've known professional techs I wouldn't trust to plug in a keyboard. Some of them made a lot of money. I have DECADES of tech experience. I also have a bunch of educational and professional credentials. Of course, I may also be a small pink bunny. You don't know. Don't listen to people on the internet, including me. Look for respected technical sites (I don't think I'm allowed to list any here) and find consensus. Ask what the worst outcome is if the writer is a moron or troll.
9) When checking the reviews, check what the 1-star reviews say. Are they bitter or factual? Drives fail? Did the company treat them well? Are they actually complaining about Amazon or a 3rd party seller?
9b) 12% of the reviews here are 1-star. A quick survey shows me at least half of them are by people that don't know as much about computers as their friends tell them they do. Half of the rest are actually complaining about other stuff. Toshiba's return policies look like they could use some work though, so use your 30-days to burn it in and back it up.

TLDR I've been using The Toshiba Canvio line since it came out and I still have and use my original drive. I've used them professionally, as have people I know in a variety of fields. I've never had a problem with any of them, neither has anyone I know and when asked for my professional recommendation, it's my go to. Lately, I've been looking for a higher capacity drive (Macs and laptops are port-deprived), but I keep coming back here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I plugged it in and my iMac froze. I had to shut down the power and unplug the drive. Should have given up then. I re-booted and plugged it in again. Froze. One more try. The icon appeared! Great. I installed the software and was instructed to re-boot. From then on, the Mac would go about ¾ of the way through start-up and would shut itself down. So I did a disk erase and restore from my old LaCie back-up, and arranged on Amazon's site to return this cruddy product for a refund. At least that part worked beautifully. I'll pick up a new LaCie (the old backup, which is about 6 years old, started making funny noises, so I replaced it with the Canvio -- big mistake).

Unfortunately, I moved after I purchased it, so I just opened it and it's past the window to return. I can't save anything to it, because it keeps telling me it's read-only. Other external drives are easy to use. Pretty much plug and play. This one is a ridiculously complicated piece of crap. And don't believe it's Mac-friendly claims. I have a Mac and I've never had problems like this with an external drive. I will NEVER buy this again. NEVER. At least it was on sale when I got it, so I'm only losing $66.99, instead of the $87.99 it's up to now. HUGE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.

*Edited to add: Forget the instructions, go into Time Machine, and have Time Machine erase and reformat the drive. That's much easier. However, considering all the problems Mac users have with this P.O.S. drive, (check out all the one-star reviews), you may wind up having a backup that's not readable, or where all your files have been changed to rtf's. I'm using it now, because it's an emergency, and keeping my fingers crossed.

I have an older WD drive that is password protected and upon opening it in windows it just prompts you to enter your password, simple, the software is contained on the drive.
For this drive you have to manually install an application on every computer before you can open it up to view files... also for some reason the software has no settings menu you can deselect it from running on startup, you have to disable it via task manager.
I have ended up using it without the software just as a plug'n'play unsecured drive. For that it has worked without issue, however I bought it because it was marketed as a being a password protected drive, so for that I give it a 2.5 stars.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Beard","Perfect match for Xbox One","December 5, 2015","I purchased this specifically for external storage on my Xbox One.  Following the advice of other reviewers I had the Xbox on and was logged in prior to connecting the drive.  The drive was instantly recognized and formatted very quickly.  I love that the Xbox asks if you want to use the drive as the default location for downloads and saves as part of the setup process, which I did.  Be advised that use of the drive as Xbox storage will force you to choose between using it as a game download/save location or as media drive.  You cannot store games or game saves on the drive and use it for video/music playback on the Xbox.  Not a big deal really with the low cost of these drives and the availability of multiple USB inputs on the Xbox you can have one of each and still barely have $100 invested.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I got it for my PS4 because I was constantly deleting games to make space for new ones and re-downloading them when I wanted to play them again. Now downloading games uses a ton of data and can sometimes take an entire day so I was tired of all that nonsense. I researched external hard drives and decided on this 2TB blue Toshiba Canvio. Now I have room for all 50+ of my games and I couldn't be happier. It does what I bought it for and 4 months later I can't think of anything negative to say about it. Setting it up to be used with my PS4 required no effort at all. I just plugged it in, the PS4 recognized it instantly, I formatted it and was all ready to store my games inside of 1 minute. Hopefully it lasts a very long time. I would absolutely recommend this hard drive to anyone looking to add more storage to their PS4. So far I have about 40 games on the hard drive and there is still roughly 500GB of memory left. So I would say that you can store an average of 50 games on the 2TB version. You get effectively 1.84TB to use and the other 0.16TB is used for system memory or something, same as when you get a phone with 32GB but there's only 28GB available. Anyway, this seems to be a great hard drive and I have zero complaints, it runs great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

In the end, he mentioned that he knew Apple had made some kind of upgrade the precluded the Mac from interacting with this particular external backup.  But he did not know what it was or how to connect with it.  He hung up, after promising me he would research this.  That was three weeks ago.  I haven’t bothered to call Toshiba.

My computer has USBs on the top that never had a problem powering my 1 TB hdd but could not power this hdd. It would show that it was connected to my computer but I could not access or use it in any way (Windows 10) It wasn't until I plugged it into a USB on the front that went straight to a USB header on my motherboard that it had enough power to light it up. Once that was done, it worked flawlessly. If you are having problems you may need to hook it up to a powered USB hub, but it is a good drive.

It amazes me how much files this thing can hold. I have stored thousands of pictures, songs, videos, college homework, etc.

Below I will list some pros and cons I found while using this hard drive:

Pros
-Small
-I will have enough memory for years and years of pictures and documents.
-Easy to operate just like a regular USB flash drive.
-Great for backing up your files
-Works with Windows 7, 8 & 10 (only three systems I've tried it on)

Cons
-Haven't found any problems with the product but will gladly update my review if I do.

Overall, I recommend this product to anyone looking for a hard drive.

Danzig","TB or not TB","August 14, 2016","After I got fed up with all the error messages I would receive using Windows 7 Backup and a 150gb Iomega portable drive, I thought I would see how much a new outboard drive would cost me.  The hard drive on my hard-working Toshiba Satellite laptop is 500gb.

Lo and behold -- a person can now get a terabyte drive for under sixty dollars!  Where do I sign up???

At any rate, I haven't lived long with this nifty Toshiba Canvio Connect II, but so far so good.  In my experience, Toshiba makes bullet-proof computing equipment.

The unit itself is just slightly larger than a pack of cards and has a handsome glossy surface.  Two lights inside flash when the drive is doing its thing, and the machine uses just one USB cable for interface and power (the Iomega used two -- how quaint!)

The NTI Backup Now EZ4 software provided seems to work very well.  It automatically schedules a daily backup of files and folders and a monthly backup of system files.  It offers the option of backing up to a cloud drive somewhere as well, but I haven't used this for fear of hacking issues.

So far, no error messages or other problems of any kind -- what a relief!

I installed an old Call of Duty (Black Ops 1) and another title from disc, and it's been seamless.

Set-up is very easy. To use, simply connect the included USB 3.0 cable (back-compatible with USB 2.0 computers) to your computer. With the Apple Time Machine, all you need to do is select ""Back Up Now"" from the drop down menu and your computer will be backed up (sometimes the ""Preparing to Back-up"" step seems to take forever but the back-up does occur). If you wish to simply back up individual files, you would ""drag and drop"" the files into the Toshiba icon on your desktop. (Reviews: JK on September 16, describes how to set up this portable drive (Thank you, JK) and is worth reading).
P.S. I also owned a LaCie 500GB USB 2.0 portable HD which failed after 23 months of use but a replacement was sent under LaCie's 2 year warranty. I read one tech review re: back-ups and the author, probably more obsessive than I, used 4 or 5 devices (!) to back-up his data. After my  wife lost important emails, she did simple document back-ups, not entire system back-ups, I purchased the Toshiba so that she and I could have redundancy by using two distinct portable hard drives. Time Machine and the two portable HDs allow this to occur without any difficulty - just plug in the drive and perform the back-up","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I moved all of my office data over to this drive and after a week of it working great, I deleted all of my data from my desktop.  The very next day, I couldn't access the data on this external drive.  It had to be taken to a Data company to have my data retrieved.  This wasn't a software issue bur a hardware issue.  Something had broken/gone wrong inside.  This drive was so new that they had to order parts to fix it in order for them to be able to deconstruct and reconstruct my data.  It ended up costing me $2,200.00 to have my data retrieved.  I realized that I was stupid for not having a 3rd backup service but shame on me for trusting this piece of equipment.  My IT guy said things like this happen but who would want to take the chance?  I have been a faithful customer of Amazon since they opened their 'virtual' doors so I called customer service.  The young lady was very nice and after explaining the issues and what it had cost me, she commented that she would go see what Amazon could do for me.  She came back and offered me a $20.00 credit on my Amazon account.  At this point I let her know that she was insulting me, told her good-bye and hung up the phone.

After filling it about 25% of capacity, it will become completely inaccessible and slow down or nearly lock up my computer.
After research and extensive work around just to be able to access the drive without it affecting the rest of my computer I ultimately had to format and lose all data on it.
In my research I found what could cause such behavior and aimed to try a few more times to verify it was not user error on my part. After the third time of the drive becoming unusable at a similar point with proper, safe use, I realized it was a reproduce-able fault that must originate from the drive itself having read instability.

Troubleshooting myself in this way took me beyond my return window for the product, so by trying to save the faulty drive I was sent, I wasted my money on something that is ultimately useless beyond the 400GB~500GB mark, which should hold 2TB.

Sadly I can not recommend Toshiba Storage solutions because of this, and will be looking to other, more reliable drives by other companies in the future.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

From the small size, high data speeds via USB 3.0, quiet operation, low operating temperature, and very small footprint. It is crazy to realize how small a physical hard drive, that is capable of holding 2 TB of data, can actually be. I took an old, over 8 years old, 1 TB USB 2.0 external hard drive and copied it over to this new hard drive; it handled it just perfectly. Since I am using this hard driver for a LINUX based OS I had to change the formatting of the drive to FAT32 and did not encounter any issues. This hard drive also will spin down in a timely fashion both saving energy and increasing the life of the hard drive itself. I would highly recommend this external hard drive for anyone who is looking for a small footprint external hard driver that operates at a very reasonable temperature.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Unlike some other external USB drive, this drive is powered off the USB port itself; therefore, no separate external power supply. This means you do not have to worry about a losing a power supply module.
I bought this drive to replace my existing Seagate drive. The Seagate drive does not connect to my laptop reliably. The problem is a bad USB connection at the Seagate drive. If I hold the USB connector at certain position, the driver connects to the laptop and it disconnects if I release holding it. USB ports are designed such that the cable side  connector has the parts that wear fast. So, if you have a connection problem, the problem is likely due to damaged cable. Based on this assumption, I had bought a new cable for the Seagate drive; however, the new cable did not solve the problem and I ended up buying the Tohsiba driver. Surprisingly, the Seagate drive connects with no problem when I use the USB cable that came with the Toshiba drive. It means the cable that came with the Toshiba drive is a better cable. I decided to keep the Tishiba drive and now I have two backup drives, which is a good thing. Note: to get the faster read and write speed, the cable and USB port on the PC must support USB 3.0. USB 3.0 is indicated by the blue plastic bar inside the port.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

As it appears has happened to others, the drive failed completely after less than 2 months of use. The computer no longer recognizes it, and it runs constantly without actually working.

There is no redeeming value in this drive. It is cheaply made and feels like it could have come from a dollar store. The USB cord easily falls out of the drive, which tanks the backup.

The software is poorly developed and certainly doesn’t make one feel that data is safe. It does not offer continuous backup and is basic.

I tried this brand after being dissatisfied with another one, only to find that it’s worse. Of course the drive failed 2 weeks after the return window closed.

I have had absolutely no issues with this at all! I’ve installed about 10 games on it and also store huge media and program files to it and haven’t even broke 3/4’s of it yet. I have yet to sense it over heat, even after playing games installed directly to it for a few hours. Applications/Programs/Games/media...whatever storage needs you have. This will do just fine. Just keep in mind the GB size and Taylor to your needs.1TB suits me perfectly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The connector cable came off and now it disconnects from the hard drive all the time. AND now it seems my computers are having a hard time recognizing the drive.  Lots of space to backup, but if it doesn’t last, then what?  I back up my work files daily so it’s extremely important that I have a good functioning hard drive.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have 3 different Virus protection programs so it wasn't that as each scan said the product had no issues .... how a device could just up and die like this is unbelieveable. Now I have work that I haven't had a chance to upload to the cloud lost forever. I'm going back to the smaller USB jump drives .... Oh & yes, there was more than enough room left on the device.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pros: USB 3.0 port, it's a Toshiba Canvio, and I've been purchasing this brand for years on Amazon (More than 10 of them) and I've never had any issue with any of the purchases, that, why I prefer this brand.  This is the first or 2T capacity, and it's working fine since day one.

Outwardly looks good with solid feel. Colours are good and easy to see which is which. I reformatted it without problems for a Mac. I transferred about 1GB of Time Machine backups and then started using it as a new backup. I like the light on top which is white for USB2.0 and blue for USB3.0. So far the hard drive is performing exactly as specified. If it fails I will update the review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Not every buyer will have a Micro B cable handy.  I do and moving the Canvio from room to room was easy without hauling the cable along.

I use the Canvio mostly from storing recorded TV programs.  The USB 3 read/writes are quite speedy.  I have not yet tried to use the included applications and have not had the drive long enough to attest to durability.  I like the drive!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XR3AA/product-reviews/B079HD84R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews"
