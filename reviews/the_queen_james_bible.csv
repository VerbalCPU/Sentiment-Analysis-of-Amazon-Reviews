On the subject of homosexuality itself the bible is quite clear. Leviticus 18:22 Thou (man) shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination. On the subject of ""Editing to prevent homophobic misinterpretation"" I.E. ""We want it to say this because the original condemns our actions"" the Bible is yet again quite clear on the matter. Duet. 4:2 makes it clear, Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall you diminish ought from it, that ye (all) may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you. These verses can be found in the Kings James Bible, a bible that was translated into English in the year 1611. I quickly read through the description of this ""Book"" and it is nothing more than just that, and stopped when it mentioned that the first reference to Homosexuality was in the 1946 Revised Standard Version of the bible.

You can't just alter it because you happen to personally disagree with certain elements.  That is, effectively, a form of censorship.

The truth is that someone who buys this book is doing so simply to make a statement on the subject of Homosexuality.  There's nothing wrong with making statements as such, but that is not what the Holy Bible is for.  You are meant to read it, ponder on it, and be transformed by the renewing of your mind.

This is simply taking the KJV (King James Version) and censoring out ANY verses that claim Homosexuality is a sin.

It is important to understand how much time and money went into this. Since the KJV is PD (Public Domain) anyone can use the text as it is no longer under any copyright, thus this cost only a few hours to do.

It's not creative, even this version may not even be copyrightable and the purpose to ""edited to prevent homophobic misinterpretation"" outright fails it's purpose.

Also the author erroneously claims ""Homosexuality was first mentioned in the Bible in 1946"" that the original KJV did not contain any references to homosexuality. This is not only false but makes no sense. The 1611 version contains the SAME references and if it did not then why not simply use the 1611 version instead of editing it? If you can't even trust the author how can you trust his censored Bible?

As for ""homophobic misinterpretation"" the claim is weak, God created Man for Woman and Woman for Man, this is biology 101 and what is next? Censoring biology books because you disagree with it? If the human race was all gay we will become extinct! Surely man cannot create a baby with a man, thus it has no purpose for God, Biology or anything else!

I know Homosexuality is ""real"" there is no doubt about that, but so is drug addiction (alcoholism), ANY sexual immorality etc. but they are all sin in the eyes of God. We cannot change what God has said but we can deny it and not chose to accept it and obey it, that is what this Bible does.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Queen-James-Bible-God/product-reviews/0615724531/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Is it any wonder that homosexuals cannot reconcile their sexual abomination with the Word of God?  So what did they do when they saw that the Word of God said homosexual behavior is a sin?

Well...instead of repenting of their sin, they chose instead to make God (the Word) a liar.

""He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: HE THAT BELIEVETH NOT hath MADE HIM A LIAR; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.""  (1 John 5:10)

The Queen James homosexuals perverted 8 key scriptures that clearly say homosexuality IS a sin...to say it IS NOT a sin.  When they made the Word (God) say 'the opposite' of what was written....they made God (the Word) a liar.  They turned the Christ (the truth) into an antichrist (liar).

Clearly....these homosexuals are not the 'believers' they claim to be...so here's little advice to those who are tempted to buy this expensive evil work of homosexuals:  Believing these homosexual antichrists instead of the Word of God is so not worth losing your soul for.  But the choice is yours.

Spoiler Alert: This is a King James Version bible with 8 verses edited: specifically: Gen. 19:5, Lev. 18:22, Lev. 20:13, Rom. 1:26, Rom. 1:27, 1 Cor. 6:9 and 1 Tim. 1:10 and Jude 1:7. The price of $ 35 for this is simply uncalled for. Save money, buy Holy Bible: King James Version , scratch out the relevant verses and insert the edits proposed on the QJV's website: Queenjamesbible.com

This is not helpful to the cause of GLBT equality or for GLBT Christians. Instead of acknowledging the difficulties in the Bible, this publication only glosses over them by covering them up. I as a gay Christian don't believe that the Bible should be interpreted against GLBT people, but I also believe that the debate has to be honest, and not use cheap trickery like changing the wording in a select eight verses to prove one's point and to make a Bible ""discrimination proof"". Do the ""editors"" not realize that the Bible that they published is also anti-woman? (1 Cor. 14:34-35)

The KJV of course has its own issues being that the source texts it uses (even in its 1769 incarnation) are grossly outdated. So why did these ""editors"" choose to use a translation that is out of date, and for all intents and purposes not used outside of fundamentalist groups? The simple answer is copyright. The KJV is public domain in the United States and not subject to copyright or licensing requirements. Respectable bible translations (especially ground up efforts) are very expensive and respectable translations used in the course of theological debate (such as ESV, NRSV, NIV, CEB) often have large committees of experienced, well-educated translators. Which brings me to the next critique of this book.

Who are the editors? The book's website is scant on details and simply lists the ""Editors"". If this is indeed a legitimate effort at debate in this field, I call out the editors to make their names AND their credentials public. Again, every respectable Bible translation effort is also transparent. Every Bible translation I own has at least the name of the head of the translation committee and a way to get a list of the names of the translators and their affiliated institutions. However, with the QJV, there are no details of who ""edited"" the translation and what if any organizations supported or underwrote this effort. It makes this edition of the Bible highly suspect, and seems to me just to be a money-making venture as opposed to a real contribution to the Church catholic's discussion on these issues.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Queen-James-Bible-God/product-reviews/0615724531/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews"

you don't see people removing the parts that say lying is a sin do you?

You don't see people removing the parts that say fornication is a sin do you?

ALL OF THOSE are just as sinful and not any more or less than homosexuality, yet the homosexual population decides they don't want to admit it so they try to change things.  Highly disrespectful.

As Christians, you're supposed to show LOVE to your brothers and sisters gay straight or WHATEVER, but it doesn't mean you're supposed to edit and modify the word or mistreat someone because they sin because EVERYONE sins.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Queen-James-Bible-God/product-reviews/0615724531/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pastor Oscar Peter Bougardt
Today I try to answer the question can a Christian be Homosexuals, please take some time and read through this article.

CAN CHRISTIANS BE HOMOSEXUALS/GAY????????
The question can Christians be homosexuals or gay my sound bizarre and even ridiculous Christians, but in today's world there are a growing number of homosexuals who claim that they are Christians and God accept their filthy lifestyle, and they are trying to approve their lifestyle by quoting scriptures. They claim that being gay was never a sin, and that the Old Testament laws only applies to practicing homosexuals or it only applies to non Christian homosexuals. The issue on homosexuality should be addressed Biblically, rather than socially, culturally or emotionally. It is not my intention to judge any homosexual, but to establish what sound Christian doctrine on whether Christians can be both homosexual and a follower of Christ at the same time.
The South African government and its constitution and society will say, homosexuality is not unlawful or even immoral, but the Word of God ( which is paramount to the law of South Africa that true Christians are concerned with), and to be honest it should really not be debatable. To the Christian that obeys God Word, any attempted Biblical to defence for illicit sexual orientation would appear downright stupid and laughable. The Word of God is clear (despite objection from so called Christian homosexuals) and His Word is not subjected to either private interpretation, personals beliefs, nor changing social or political climate of the day. (Leviticus 18v22-23 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it's an abomination. Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto; it is confusion). Need I to say anything further the Word of God is absolute.
Homosexual activity is called an abomination by God, which is a disgusting filthy act that is abhorrent to God. Homosexuality is noted right along with other unnatural acts such as bestiality, meaning that those who have homosexual relationships behave like animals. God wants us to know that homosexuality is not natural, to prove this God order severe punishment upon any person who indulges in these abominations. ( Leviticus 20v13 If a man also lies with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them) Once again its clear homosexuality does not have God' approval.
The passages don't leave much room for debate, we can concede that God does not approve of homosexuality and those who practices these filthy lifestyle are doomed for hell. In today' life sick clergy like Desmond Tutu, Rowan Smith and Deborah Bell will argue that this scripture does don't apply to them as believers in Christ Jesus under the New Covenant, but they are wrong the Old Covenant and New Covenant complement each other and the Word of God is absolute. Their rationale being they no longer under the law but under grace and that the law does not apply to Christians today, but that would be akin to arguing that we can murder in the New Testament cause we are no longer under the Old Testament against it. That is absurd, just because we are under grace does not mean that we can violate the moral law with impunity. (Romans 6v1 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace abound?).

Grace does not give us the authority to be immoral, and it does not change God's morality or gives us license to transgress the Law of God. Know the question still remain, can Christians be homosexuals/gay? The answer is clear NO, you cannot serve two God' at the same time, you either homosexual serving satan or you are a Christian doing the will of Christ Jesus. This precept of God in Leviticus 20 is unambiguous, concise, and plainly stated in the clearest language. It bridges on nonsensical to hear some homosexuals and even your so called clergy attempt to defeat God' condemnation of homosexuality by rationalizing that grace negates God' will. In accordance with the law of God, the activity of a man lying with another man sexually is an abomination full stop. In other words homosexuality is unclean, loathsome, detestable, disgusting to our Holy God.
If any person is led by the Holy Spirit , and believe that God is Holy and that He cannot sin, we must believe that homosexuality is something that is both unnatural and abhorrent to God, and the practise of homosexuality is against harmony of the divine order of His creation. By precept of scripture it is an unnatural act that God deems unlawful. Anyone attempting to make a defense of Homosexual activity by claiming that it is not really a sin or transgression against God's law is kidding themselves. Likewise, anyone claiming that this merely addresses ritualistic abomination has no real concept of the supreme authority of God's word. They are lacking in understanding the biblical principle that ""God's word is not subject to our private or personal interpretations."" ( Below T Warren researched and shared his views if a Christian be homosexual and he uses scripture references to back his claims.
Psalms 119:105
* ""Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.""
God's word is something that He has set to light the path that we are to follow. It is not something that we can attempt to lead. Yet in our day the plague of homosexuality is sweeping over the world like a malignant disease, and it lashes out against every moral, lawful, and chaste fiber of faithfulness and obedience by Christians. But instead of taking warning against this wickedness, most Christians are silent in a complacent stupor as it gains respectability, and even acceptability in some Churches. Instead of creating outrage and the need to bear witness to God's laws, Christian Pastors are speaking about toning it down, about compassion, and about our need for tolerance. These are nothing more than euphemistic words for capitulation and compromise. In order to remain faithful to God, Christians cannot be deceived by the media or rebellious ministers. They must continue to preach and fight the good fight against the growing apostasies such as homosexuality, divorce, fornication, abortion, adultery, and all forms of ungodly immorality. For these are perilous and deceptive times in which we live. They are a trial or testing of our faith in Christ. And how we stand reveals whether we have true Godliness within us, or simply have the outward appearance of Godliness.
2nd Timothy 3:1-5
* ""This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
* For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
* Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,
* Traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;
* Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.""
In greater and greater numbers, people today are lovers of themselves (what we today call humanism), covetous or materialistic, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, children hating parents, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, and lovers of pleasures (hedonism) more than lovers of God. It is in today's arena of degradation that we see not only the growth and tacit acceptance of the gay lifestyle, but also the spurious denials by many that this is even a transgression against the law of God. Even though the Bible plainly declares that, ""if a man lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination,"" there are those who would remove the ancient landmarks from the Bible with lips dripping with the bitter wormwood of rebellion and nullification. Nevertheless, God is not mocked, and all the transparent justifications will not hide man's sin in the day of vengeance.

Does This Verse Only Condemn ""Practicing"" Homosexuality?
There is a growing school of thought in some Church circles, which hypothesizes that Leviticus chapter twenty at best describes ""practicing homosexuality"" only, and not homosexual ontology. This back door defense is without any scriptural validation, and is actually nothing more than baseless debate or justifications of man's wisdom. Moreover, saying that there are non-practicing homosexuals is akin to saying that there are non-practicing harlots, or there are non-practicing murderers. Why would any Christian want to call herself a harlot if they are no longer selling themselves? Of course, the only honest answer is that, they wouldn't! It is really a ridiculous concept, and yet it has found favor in some Churches. These are those who want to be called Christian, but who also insist on retaining the title of Homosexual or Gay Christian. The reasons they give may vary, but they all have that same attachment to the concept. ie, though they profess outwardly to be of Christ, they really don't want to completely let go or surrender their old life for Him. And keeping the name allows them to partially hold on to the delusion that it's really not an unlawful thing to be Gay. Is a non-practicing homosexual still guilty of homosexuality? Of course he is. Because the sin is in the very ""thought process,"" not the physical act itself. Would a Christian who has an adulterous thought pop into his head, then choose to call himself a Christian Adulterer? God forbid! Likewise, there is no such thing as a Christian Homosexual. The mere fact that someone would have a desire to retain the title homosexual, while professing their new life in Christ, indicates that they have not yet truly repented of their sin. It is actually a dire confession that they desire to retain certain name rights to that former lifestyle. In the true Christian who is born from above, there has been a great spiritual change. We are no longer swine, but sheep. Would anyone want to retain the moniker, swine? It makes no sense.
Of course, the modernist would query, ""What's in a name?"" But I would retort that one who desires a name that signifies something that is an abomination to God, should instead question, ""what is really in his heart."" Because what we once were, in Christ Jesus we are no more.
2nd Corinthians 13:5
* ""Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?""
For the very title ""Homosexual"" delineates a sin against God, and illustrates a continuing mind set that is adversarial to obedience. This is the deception of our day that goes unchallenged in most Churches. The wretched ""political correctness"" within our society wherein we look upon homosexuality as not so much a deliberate sin, but as an involuntary lifestyle. We have been so brainwashed by the constant indoctrination in the media that without knowing it, we have let man's word supercede God's word. But a non-practicing homosexual is just as much in sin against God as a practicing one would be. For it is self-evident that he has not truly repented of the sin nature wherein he would no longer ""desire"" to be called Homosexual. He doesn't yet understand that he cannot take upon himself the name of Christ, and also retain the name Homosexual. The terms are as mutually exclusive as the terms abominable and righteousness. It's like saying that you are a ""Christian Abomination,"" or that you are a ""Christian Whore."" No one would say those things because they realize that this type terminology is contradictory to Christianity, not something that can go hand in hand with it. We cannot claim to be ""Christian Homosexuals"" because it is a contradiction in terms.

Will The Homosexual Be Saved?
A former Homosexual who has turned to Christ can be saved. But will someone who is a Homosexual be saved? According to some liberal philosophers in the Church, yes. But not according to the inerrant word of God. Scripture states quite plainly that those who lay with a man as they would with womankind, shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Don't look at me as judge, for those are God's words, not mine. Or shall we defer to the unrighteous Pastor or teacher instead? There will always be those who choose to ignore what is written, or to make up their own laws and rules concerning doctrines of the Church, but if we will ""receive"" God's word of truth, there can be no mistaking what He has said. That is to say, if we are honest with ourselves, as opposed to lying to ourselves (1st John 2:4 1st John 2:4
4 ""He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.""
). With the Spirit of Christ within us, we will be those who will not be deceived by man's word of nullification.
1st Corinthians 6:9
* ""...be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the Kingdom of God.""
Note that the caution by God is that we ""be not deceived,"" and that alone should alert us that we must be aware that there will be those who will try and deceive us by claiming that these people ""shall"" inherit the Kingdom of Heaven. Selah! ie, Preachers telling us that adulterers, drunkards, and homosexuals can be Christian and inherit the kingdom. God says no, ""be not deceived,"" they shall not inherit it. So for people today to blatantly ignore that precept and claim that they will (as so many do), is both confusion and a denial that God's Holy word is true.
Of course, this does not mean that a Christian who was formerly an adulterer, drunkard, or homosexual cannot ever in a period of weakness fall back into one of those sins. What it means is that they are a new creation whose desire will now be to do the will of God and not their own. Thus, while they may sin, they are no longer adulterers, homosexuals, or drunkards. So even if they should stumble and sin, they will no longer live in that sin. They will have repentance, and their sins will be forgiven because they have an advocate in heaven and His Spirit dwelling within them. Likewise, they have no desire to be called adulterers, homosexuals, or drunkards, for they understand that old things are passed away, and Grace is not license to continue in sin.
Galatians 5:13
* ""For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.""
How shall they that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? How can they who are called to grace and liberty use that liberty to continue in sin? They will no longer live comfortably in their sin, but will eschew it, confess it, repent of it, and understand in their heart that it is evil. This will become something that they want to distance themselves from, not something they want to keep near. They will not have the mind-set that Homosexuality is something they want to retain ""name rights"" to.
Indeed, I have heard those who arrogantly state:
""I don't practice, but I am a Homosexual and proud of it. And I am a Christian, no matter what anyone says.""
With all due respect, this is merely another example of the insidious delusion of Satan. And to be sure, it doesn't matter what I say or what any other man says. But what does matter is what God says. And without judging, I'm afraid that the sad truth is that this man was probably no more a Christian than Judas was in being one of the Apostles. No more a Christian than cult leaders are in standing up boldly calling on the name of the Lord as their Saviour. They all delude themselves because they lack the spirit of truth. We can be former thieves, former pornographers, and former homosexuals, but we cannot be those things and be Christian also. A Christian is a ""new"" creation sealed with the Holy Spirit. And so they would no longer want to be called that which is abominable to God. Rather than a source of pride, this title would be an abomination to them, the same as it is to God.
Moreover, those Pastors who teach such contradicting doctrines to gay men ands women, deceive a great many of them into thinking that they can have peace of mind, when in fact there is no peace with God (Jeremiah 8:11 Jeremiah 8:11
11 ""For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.""
). Thus, these pastors have the greater sin. For to say that a homosexual can inherit the kingdom is not only ""dangerous"" (as it gives those looking for an excuse, a false sense of security), but it is also false prophecy. According to God's very own words in 1st Corinthians 6:9, Homosexuals will not inherit the kingdom of heaven. But the faithful witness can give hope in God's word that they need not fret, because those who have cast that name aside for the name of Christ, can.
Colossians 3:9-10
* ""Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;
* And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:""
The casting of former things behind us is an integral part of the Salvation process. And unfortunately, that is what many professing Christians and Pastors do not understand.

Some Say That Word Simply Describes Temple Prostitution
The word in 1st Corinthians 6:9 that is translated ""Abusers of themselves with mankind"" in the KJV, is actually the Greek word [arsenokoites], meaning ""to lay with a male."" In the literal, to ""bed a male,"" the same sin which God called an abomination (Leviticus 20:13 Leviticus 20:13
13 ""If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.""
). This term is from the Greek words [arsen], meaning male, and [koite] meaning bed (from the root [keimai], meaning lay). And combined in this context, they illustrate the sense of lying with a man sexually. God unambiguously declares that these shall not inherit the Kingdom of God. Now let's be clear that I didn't say that, God said that. And He said it as plain as it can be said. The half-baked theory that the objection may simply describe Temple Prostitution is a contrived cocktail of conjecture and supposition. It is not an interpretation that has its foundation in the pertinent scriptures at all, but a theory by those who analyze cultures and is unsubstantiated by the Holy Canon. Clearly, the word there means to ""lay a male"". And for anyone to take that clearly understandable word, and inject it with an extra-biblical and self-serving interpretation that it really means men who sell themselves for money, is tortuous of the verse. In biblical terms, it is called ""wresting"" or twisting the scriptures to make them conform to one's own ideas. The truth is, there is not even one iota, jot or tittle about the Temple, nor about selling, nor about prostitution. To presuppose and then inject this secular idea into scripture, is in the final analysis ""adding to God's word."" Not to mention the fact that we don't understand scripture in a vacuum, and this is not the only passage that condemns males lying with males (what is today commonly called Homosexuality). Every verse that speaks about this practice would have to be twisted in order to support such a conclusion.
But this is the kind of rationalization and self-justification that goes into the defense of breaking God's laws. It always starts (like the serpent in the garden) with the words, ""..hath God Said?"" From there, Satan will proceed to sow the seed of doubt about what God actually said, and if He actually means it. Men are quick to ""read into"" the scriptures and inject their own biased agenda about what scripture means (though it didn't say). Because then he can cast doubt on the word of God really meaning ""men who lay with men."" And then those who want to believe what is right in their own eyes will have an excuse to formulate their own rebellious views about homosexuality. In their minds they can then do so without having to blatantly call God's word a lie. In their own self-justification they can declare, ""..it is not that we don't believe God, it is just that we think we can interpret this another way."" ie, the strict biblical view is only our opinion.

We Are All Sinners, Aren't Homosexuals Just Sinners Too?
Yes, this is true. But Christians are not Homosexuals. Neither are they Whores, Thieves, Murderers and Drunkards. The distinction is that these are not terms for Christians. There is a difference between being a homosexual and being a sinner, and it's not just semantics. We may fall into sin, but we will not any longer live that former lifestyle. In the Spirit that dwells with us, we have an earnest desire to repent or turn away from former things. Not a desire to retain the title in order to keep some ""vicarious"" pleasure in it, but to make it as ""dead"" to us. This will be our sincere desire when we become true Christians. Those very verses we have read illustrate just this particular principle.
1st Corinthians 6:9-11
* ""Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
* Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
* And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God"".
And such WERE some of you, but not anymore. That is the mindset of a true Christian. Not one of, ""I still want to be called Homosexual,"" but one of, ""Such as I once was, but not anymore."" They are washed now, that they may not continue being a homosexual, even though they might fall into that sin, they will not live it. They will repent of it and grow in grace. That is the mind of Christ and the frame of mind of a true Christian.
Romans 6:1-4
* ""What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
* God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?
* Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?
* Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life"".
We walk in newness of life because the old man is passed away. How can we walk in newness of life while calling ourselves Harlots still, Drunkards still, or Homosexuals still? Jesus, through His Spirit, can move the homosexual to stop living in this destructive lifestyle. He can remove the sensual desire for a person of the same sex. But Homosexuals or gays will never understand this truth if professed Christians keep telling them that they can remain a Homosexual and still be a Christian.
Hebrews 11:6
* ""But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him"".
We witness to them that becoming a Christian means that we have had a new birth (2nd Corinthians 5:17). God not only forgives us and cleanses us from all unrighteousness (1st John 1:9), but He give us of His Spirit that provides the strength to not sin this way anymore (Romans 8:26). Jesus wonderfully forgave the women caught in adultery, but He also told her, ""..go and sin no more."" (John 8:11). In a phrase, ""Truth, inspires change.""

But The Word Homosexual Is Not In Scripture
The fact is, the words ""homosexual"" or ""gay"" are merely a modern translations for lifestyles and acts that are almost as old as mankind. It is simply a euphemism describing what God calls the vile affections of people who lay sexually with those of the same gender. The identical word modern doesn't have to be in scripture, because what the word represents is unquestionably in scripture. Just as the word embezzlement is a traditional euphemism that simply means someone is stealing. And annulment is a traditional euphemism meaning divorce. And abortion is a traditional euphemism that means killing an unborn baby. These replacement words are generally devised to hide or cloak the harsh reality of their true meaning. They are used so that it makes whatever it defines somewhat easier for people to accept. That is why the term ""Homosexual"" has even grown a negative connotation and has been changed to ""gay."" Think about it. Who is going to accept these ideas if we say, ""I'm going to kill my child before it is born."" That's why this act is replaced with the word ""abortion,"" and now with even less harsh sounding euphemisms. But God has no such political agendas, and He calls these sins exactly what they are. He calls homosexuality, vile affections, men lying with men, women with women, doing that which is unseemly, unnatural and abominable. That's what God calls it. so simply claiming the English word ""Homosexual"" is not in the Hebrew or Greek scriptures does not loose man from the laws of God against the practice. We can eliminate the word Homosexual all together, but then we'd have to call it what the Bible does. But in our day, that would not be considered politically correct. It would not be a loving Christian (gasp) attitude to call anything by the same term the scriptures give it. Nevertheless, while it may not be politically correct, it is Biblically incorrect to say anything less than the scriptures say.

Some Churches Say The Homosexual Gene Is A God Given Inherited Nature
That is not only a ludicrous statement, it is a blasphemous statement. Heresy in the Church is almost as old as dirt, and it's growing by leaps and bounds today. But the conscientious Christian does not go by what some Churches or the scientists say, they go by what God says as authoritative. Homosexuality is not a nature that men are born with (except it is the nature of sin), on the contrary it embodies all that is ""AGAINST"" the nature of God. These professing Christians who make this claim have been brainwashed by an arrogant and immoral society, and have totally forsaken God's word for the wisdom of the world.
1st Corinthians 3:18-20
* ""Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.
* For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.
* And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.""
In Christ, we find that real wisdom is in what God says. And He declares that this is not natural, and that it is just the opposite of natural. And the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness (Romans 1:18 ). We read in Romans Chapter one that there is a progression that leads to this wrath of God. God declares that they hold down the truth in unrighteousness, exchanging the truth of God for a lie, who worshipped and served the creation rather than the Creator, therefore God gave them up to these vile affections where even their women changed the ""natural use"" into that which is against nature, and they encouraged others to do the same. That is why the wrath of God justly falls on them where they are worthy of death and without excuse.
Romans 1:26-27
* ""For this cause God gave them up to vile affections: for even their women did change the Natural use into that which is Against Nature!
* And likewise also the men, leaving the Natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; Men with Men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet.""
God uses homosexuality as indicative of man's contemptible degradation and deep seated rebellion against Him. So we see once again that God's word is 180 degrees opposite of what the world says is true, as it is wise in its own conceits. The homosexual lust in people is not born of his ""God given"" birthright, it is not a Godly alternative lifestyle, and it is not his or her ""natural affection."" It is just as God says, a vile [atimia] or disgraceful affection, and it is unseemly [aschemosune], indecent or shameful behavior. If we claim that it is congenitive natural desires that homosexuals are following, then to whom is God speaking? Is He talking to the air? Indeed, who are we to believe? God is addressing this on a moral level, not a physiological level. Only if we are in total rebellion against God can these passages be adulterated to deny what God clearly declares. Because according to the written word, homosexual behavior is evidence of an active rebellion against God. So as the scripture declares, ""let God be true and every man a liar"" -Romans 3:4. The wrath of God is revealed wherein God gives them up, allows them to go further into their degradation because they loved themselves, the creation, more than God, the creator. Clearly God is illustrating here that both a man and a woman have a natural nature. And He is illustrating that to pervert that nature (man with man and woman with women) is an abomination to God, a grievous sin against His divinely created order.
Deuteronomy 22:5
* ""The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy God.""
The specific scriptural text forbidding cross dressing addresses the ""visible"" perversion of the natural order that God has established. It shows us quite plainly that God looks upon these unnatural acts, not as frivolous or an alternative lifestyle or as harmless fun, but as an abomination. The fact is, God has always been crystal clear on the matter, it is man who tries to distort God's words for his own selfish purposes. It is society who tries to make up their own rules and laws governing what is natural and what is not. In God's word, natural is not determined by what society wants sexually, but by how God created people to function sexually. To the rationalization it away claiming, ""it's just how some people are born,"" is rebellion. God says there, be not deceived! It's not natural affection, it is not God given nature, it is sin against both God and nature. And it's illogical and irrational for anyone professing to be a Christian to claim that God gave this nature to some people (constitutional homosexuality).
1st Timothy 1:9-10
* ""Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,
* For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for men stealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;""
Those who want to insist homosexuality is not against God's law and is natural or God given, do so at their own peril. As for me and my house, we believe God when He says it is unlawful, unnatural, and vile. The doctrines and rationalizations going on in the Church today about homosexuality would have been unbelievable just fifty years ago, but now so much of the Church is spiritually depraved that it is considered ""Christian love"" to claim that they are saved. It is considered an act of compassion to not tell them of the wages of such sin. And it is considered cruel and judgmental to bear ""faithful witness"" to what God says. But nothing could be further from the truth. Homosexuals are what they are because of their sin nature. If I am a habitual fornicator, can I claim I'm that way because I have a gene which makes me lust after many women? Most certainly not, because sin is in all of us and ca","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Queen-James-Bible-God/product-reviews/0615724531/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_35?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=35&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This is not the bible, it's perversion. You cannot live as a homosexual and also be a Christian. The two are opposites. It's like saying you are law abiding while you rob a bank.

God's values NEVER change. So this book tried to force them too by twisting what the bible says. Homosexuality is immorality. Sodom, Rome, and nearly every broken nation in history was proceeded by such immorality. Homosexuality breaks morals, family, health and stability every time. But most importantly, it's wrong because God says it's wrong. End of story.

God and Christ have no part with in the homosexual lifestyle. Christ is the remission of sins but he offers no covering for those that live in rejection of him. Those that love in sin have refused Christ.

Romans 1:27 - And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet.

Deuteronomy 23:17 - There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel.

1 Corinthians 6:9 - Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate (homosexuality, Greek Dictionary), nor abusers of themselves with mankind.

Leviticus 18:22 - Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it [is] abomination.

I don't make excuses for God or apologize for his values. What the worlds imaginary Jesus supports is irreverent to the real Jesus who died for our sins and shed his blood so we could live if we accept and follow him. The real Jesus is one with God and his word. That will never change. Everyone has a choice. You either accept God or reject him. There is no middle ground. You have the right to reject truth, but it does not change the nature of it.

I get that the cover is to show that it's ""gay friendly"" but its not so user friendly and the title seems a bit mocking to me. I wish they would offer this same bible in a smaller version with the same notes in front and with a better quality binding. I also get that it would probably be difficult to find a bible publisher for this, but I am willing to be patient. If I knew a gay that wanted a bible I would give this one to them.

You better be careful because you can say you are a ""preacher"" of God's infallible Word all you want, but you will pay severely as God does not take anyone changing His word for their gain financial or otherwise lightly! MY Lord help us!

It's ridiculous, unnecessary, and inhumane.

But the word 'homosexual' in Greek is broken into two part ""man"" and ""mat or bed"".  The truth is God does love all people - whether they are gay, straight, bi-sexual, transgender or lesbian...  God does...  But the truth is that homosexuality violates God's design.  And further, it (like many aspects of our life) is a choice.  I have the choice of what I eat, I have the choice of what I wear, I have the choice of where I go, I have the choice of what I say... And I have a choice in who I love... and with whom I enter into relationships...  A new Bible is not needed...  Studying the Bible is what is needed.  This does not make me a 'hater'.  This makes me one that wants to encourage others to make godly decisions and choices - to discern what is pleasing to God - not self...","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Queen-James-Bible-God/product-reviews/0615724531/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I did this to be able to have in depth, intelligent theological discussions with an elderly neighbor of the Pentecostal faith. Our discussions would last for hours and were fascinating in the respect that 2 individuals reading the very same Bible could have different interpretations and opinions.  I believe I can speak intelligently about the verbiage changes in the Queen James Bible.  First and foremost let me say that Our Lord Jesus Christ was set upon this earth to teach peace, love, tolerance and acceptance to all that would listen to his teachings. That being said and having read the vernacular clarifications within the The Queen James Bible, I can confidently say that the passages are more in line with earlier versions of the Bible (Pre-KJV).  King James I was a well known Bisexual with many male lovers.  However, to hide this fact he commissioned another interpretation of the Bible.  Hence the King James Version.  (In January 1604, King James VI of Scotland and I of England convened the Hampton Court Conference where a new English version was conceived in response to the perceived problems of the earlier translations as detected by the Puritans,[7] a faction within the Church of England.[8]  James gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy.[9] The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England.[10] ) ~Citation Wikipedia~

In conclusion, I believe that the Queen James Bible is an excellent interpretation that is acceptable to all irregardless of sexual orientation. It still teaches about The Father, Jesus & Faith in Our Lord no matter what one's level of faith is.

""You don't have enough faith,"" Jesus told them. ""I tell you the truth, if you had faith even as small as a mustard seed, you could say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it would move. Nothing would be impossible.""  Matthew, 17:20","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Queen-James-Bible-God/product-reviews/0615724531/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_35?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=35&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This isn't just a different interpretation. The authors in fact changed the core teachings of the iriginal text by substituting context for a different context as well as substituing words for different words with different meanings. The fact that they did this is admission by them that the actual Bible does categorically condemn homosexual practice in any and all situations and circumstances. The devout Christian sees sexuality and marriage through the lens of Biblical teaching, and then makes the adjustments in their lives to better align with GOD's word. Those who place idolatry, pride, and perversion as their new ""god"" will start with the lens of their sexual and romantic desires and then try to rewrite GOD's word a through that lense. The latter is what we have here in the queen james ""bible."" This is a free country, things like this can and will exist, but it's still very shameful.

What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it? Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. For one who has died has been set free from sin. Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him.
Romans 6:1‭-‬9 ESV

But from the beginning of creation, 'God made them male and female.'
Mark 10:6 ESV

Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous. Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God.

Foster","Questionable Exegesis","May 27, 2014","With the publication of the Queen James Bible, the editors are very brave in following their convictions – they demonstrate that there is a serious debate to be had, and that a number of those who are in, or who agree with, same-gender relationships, do identify themselves as Christian – a point with which I cannot disagree. I may disagree concerning issues of biblical exegesis, but then I disagree with others over biblical exegesis, but on different topics of discussion – that is not a reason to discount their fellowship in Christ.
My comments concern the issue of biblical exegesis especially where it concerns translation.
It seems to me that the publication philosophy of this bible is; that if you dislike comments in the Biblical text, then find research that is convenient to your viewpoint, and amend the offending verses. There is an emerging tradition in this direction – witness “The Inclusive Bible”.
In the preface entitled “A Gay Bible” it suggests that this is a serious work, however, it seems to me that the renaming in the title (to “Queen James” from King James) is gratuitous, and seems ‘camp’ (affected) – even taking into account King James’ alleged bi-sexual nature. If there is a serious point to be made, the renaming detracts from that. The Introduction (The Editor’s Notes) does provide a serious read, but I suspect many will fail to get that far put off by the title.
Still found in ‘pro-same gender attraction’ Christian literature is the recasting of the Levitical injunctions against same sex unions as being injunctions against sacred prostitution. The Queen James Bible is no exception (mentioned on page 5 of the Bible). This claim concerning sacred prostitution has been thoroughly debunked by Dr Stephanie Budin, in ""The Myth of Sacred Prostitution in Antiquity"" Cambridge University Press 2008. Budin's work is not original and uses the work pioneered by an Israeli Professor Mayer Gruber, whose work is not available in English but has proved beyond doubt that there is no ""ambiguity"" in the prohibition for sexual relationship among same sex men. Dr. Mayer I. Gruber, is professor in the Department of Bible and Ancient Near East at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Beersheva, Israel. His works are as follows;  Mayer I. Gruber, “The qadesh in the Book of Kings and in Other Sources” [in Hebrew], Tarbiz 52 (1983): 167–76; idem, “Hebrew qedeshah and its Canaanite and Akkadian Cognates,” Ugarit Forschungen 18 (1986): 133–48; idem, “The qedeshah—What Was its Function?” [in Hebrew], Beer Sheva 3 (1988).
The other points in the Introduction (Editor’s Notes pages 3-9) defending the changes in the King James Version text, have been amply discussed by Professor Robert A. J. Gagnon in his book “The Bible and Homosexual Practice, Texts and Hermeneutics”, Abingdon Press, Nashville, 2001; the conclusions of which differing from those which justify the changes in the King James Bible text to create the present “Queen James” edition.
Also some argue (but not in this bible) that our Lord was silent on the subject of same-gender relationships, but that silence is not absolute. In the Matthean affirmation for marriage given by our Lord, is the assumption of the anthropology of the Old Testament (our Lord quotes from Genesis) and the Levitical Law which still held in the mind of Jesus (Matthew 5:18).
I do understand the pastoral issues, especially when it is argued that those with a same sex attraction cannot help that attraction.  For many concerned Christians, a pastoral approach, that is in concert with a biblical witness is a better solution, recognising God does indeed forgive the failings of our human fragility - of all mankind - not just a section – and not just relating to sexual relationships, as if those led to the most serious sins!  Psalm 103:10-14; “He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us. Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.”","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Queen-James-Bible-God/product-reviews/0615724531/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

[Romans 1:26-27] ""For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: 27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.""[1 Corinthians 6:9] ""Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind.""

Secondly, after having studied many claims of King James VI and I homosexual ventures I have found them seriously lacking. As a matter of fact, the first person to make such a claim was a courtesan, Sir Henry Wotton, whose family had been removed from their family position by King James; and, this courtesan took care not to make such a claim until after the King and his son were dead. Add to that the deeply enthralling letters of love he wrote for his wife and the thread unravels yet more.

James' own view of homosexuality, as expressed in Basilikon Doron, was that it was a grievous sin never to be forgiven. How then can this claim of his sexual perversion stand in light of historic evidences. Just because James had friends that were guys and gave them gifts does not make him a homosexual.

Lastly, to edit eight verses because you disagree with them shines light on the desire to cover sin. We are told by Christ that those who work evil deeds will not come to the light lest their evil deeds should be seen and reproved. The cults and those who disagree with the Bible always try to change it to fit their worldviews or standards. The child of God does the opposite, seeking to alter their worldviews and standards to fit the Word of God.

This work is merely meant to be a slap in the face to those who oppose homosexuality based on the Scriptures and to uphold a sinful lifestyle for those obviously in conflict with the truth. Well, James was no queen. The changes make no difference to the truth. The Lord remains immutable and sovereign. The ploy to liberate your monies for the purpose of supporting something for the sake of making others upset is an obvious act of carnality. Waste your money on a good dinner, not on this garbage. And then head to the dollar store for a good $1 paperback Bible.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Queen-James-Bible-God/product-reviews/0615724531/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Let me live in sin!","January 24, 2015","There is a problem with this Queen James Bible. You see, the word of God was not given to please people, or that people may like what is written in it. God does not conform to man, man has to conform to God. If I can't change because that is how I was born that way, I tell you what, every sinner is born that way. We are all born sinners. If this be the case, then maybe we should remove (or interpret) the word sin from the Bible. Would not that solve the problem of sin? It is up to you to decide. The Word of God does not change and that is why it is the word of God. God has given right to man to sin, but He has not given him the right to force his ways of sin or even his ways of life upon others. Gays and Leabians have right to live their lifestyle as much as they want, but they have no right to force their lifestyle upon others, as much as Christian churches have never had any right to force their teachings and ways of life upon others. Even though Christian churches forced their beliefs and ways of life upon other in the past, it was wrong, and it is still wrong. Just because homosexuals are doing it does not make it right. Homosexuals can establish their own churches just Anton Levey established the church of Satan. Did anybody prevent him from doing that? Certainly none! So, why aren't homosexuals trying to establish their own churches and get married in those churches? Simply because they are following in the footsteps of the devil who does things always by deception and force, unlike Christ.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Queen-James-Bible-God/product-reviews/0615724531/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Toth","Doesn't make any sense","April 1, 2013","If you are going to alter some facts to suit your needs, regardless of how small, that makes the whole a work of fiction more than a ""version"". Imagine if a science book decided to change some laws of physics - what people would be saying. Most definitely, that it is NOT a science book.

To those whom embrace the Biblical view of marriage, there is only one truth - that marriage is blessed because it is in the image of God. When God made Adam, he was in the true image (100%). Then He removed a part to create Eve (for this example, we will say man is 51% and woman is 49%). Even though today some will say that ""man"" is in the image of God, the reality is both are PART of the image. And thus, only when the two parts (51% + 49%) come together is it a true reflection of God and this is why He blessed marriage and saw only 1 flesh when looking at a married couple. For those who believe 51+51 = 100 or that 49+49=100, they are simply wrong.

And one last point - it is not by accident that the gay community takes the symbol of God (""His Bow"" that He placed in the heavens) to make a mockery of the image of God (marriage). And to form it into the sign of his redemption (the cross) on this book is just the pinnacle of blasphemy in my opinion.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Queen-James-Bible-God/product-reviews/0615724531/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The honest way would be to say ""we disagree with what these verses say"".","August 3, 2018","As a Libertarian, I don't care how other people live their lives, so long as they don't violate the constitutional rights of any citizens. So, if someone wants to change verses in the KJV and make the Bible say whatever they want it to say, that is their right as an American citizen, so long as they don't force their changes on others.

As for the Bible and description given, the information given about the KJV is patently false. Genesis 19, for instance, states that the men of Sodom wanted to know the men staying as quests in the home of Lot. Over 3 decades ago, I heard a speaker on Public Radio state that all the men of Sodom wanted to do was know who the men are who were staying in Lot's home. I knew the speaker was misrepresenting the passage at the time. So, I know the claim made in the description that:

""Homosexuality was first mentioned in the Bible in 1946, in the Revised Standard Version. There is no mention of or reference to homosexuality in any Bible prior to this - only interpretations have been made. Anti-LGBT Bible interpretations commonly cite only eight verses in the Bible that they interpret to mean homosexuality is a sin; Eight verses in a book of thousands!""

is patently false and an attempt to rewrite history.

By claiming falsely that those verses were improperly interpreted and then issuing their own translation, the group responsible for the publication of this translation seem to want rewrite history and then claim that anyone who reads chapters like Genesis 19 in context is in error. Hence:

""The Queen James Bible seeks to resolve interpretive ambiguity in the Bible as it pertains to homosexuality: We edited those eight verses in a way that makes homophobic interpretations impossible.""

The group responsible for this translation is actually slandering everyone who holds what is the traditional view for Millennia about these passages.
Apparently, many LGBT really do want to force their ways on anyone and everyone who holds the traditional view. What's next? Making a law against owning a copy of the King James Bible? These are clear violations of the guaranteed constitutional rights of American citizens. By rewriting history a la Orwell's 1984, it is clear that many LGBT want to be able to oppress citizens who hold what was the view universally for millennia!

Why not just say ""we disagree with some passages in the Bible and so we are publishing a bible that fits what we truly believe"". That would be the honest thing to do.

""Know"" in Genesis 19 is a figure of speech. Adam knew Eve. That's how they had children. So, why would Lot ask the men of Sodom not to act wickedly? Why would he offer his two daughters instead? Lot was a judge in Sodom, a magistrate. If a male mob came to an American judge's door and demanded to ""know"" two male visitors, and the judge in fear offered his daughters instead, that mob would be arrested by the police. Further, the context has Lot attempting to save the male visitors from a male mob. Why try to get the male mob to take his daughters instead? The reason is obvious: They male mob wanted to know the male visitors in the same way Adam knew Eve.

So obviously, some in the LGBT community wants force those who believe these Bible passages to read a bible that does not state God is angry at homosexuals for their practices.

There is a much better way to do things. Why not publish a KJV bible where these verses are bracketed off with marginal notes. An even better way is to write a book using modern biblical scholarship to demonstrate that Moses did not write the Torah.

I think many in the LGBT community, now that they have more rights in Secular America, which is guaranteed to them by the US Constitution and Bill of Rights (which allows Freedom Of Religion and Freedom FROM Religion) now want to take rights away from those Christians who believe those passages in the Bible. They want to do so by forcing the issue and using the Queen James Bible to eliminate any possible interpretation of Bible passages that offends the LGBT community.

Just as violating the constitutional rights of members of the LGBT community is a crime, so is violating the rights of Bible Believing Christians.

This goes to show that some in the LGBT community are just as hateful and selfish as some Bible Believing Christians who want to force their Rule of Law on Americans.

Now, if the publishers of the Queen James translation came clean and said they wanted to publish a KJV Bible with verses showing God as described in the Bible to have no problem with the LGBT community, I wouldn't have bothered to write this review. I would have ignored the product.
However, with the agenda stated in the description so clearly showing they want to force their views on others, I have to complain.

I don't want the LGBT community controlling my life anymore than I want Bible Believing Christians controlling my life. However, under the US Constitution and Bill of Rights, both have the right to freedom of speech, so long as they don't infringe upon the rights of others.

By the way, I am NOT a Bible Believing Christian!","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Coincidentally, in OT times BAAL was a title and honorific word meaning ""Lord"" or GOD.
So if your GOD is the ""Lord"", are you unknowingly doing obeisance to BAAL?
""At first the name Baal was used by the Jews for their God without discrimination, but as the struggle between the two religions developed, the name Baal was given up by the Israelites as a thing of shame, and even names like Jerubbaal were changed to Jerubbosheth: Hebrew bosheth means ""shame""."" (Wikipedia)
The Christ declared in John 17:26 KJV that he had ""declared unto them thy name"", that is GOD'S name.
We can be certain that he didn't mean BAAL or LORD!","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Queen-James-Bible-God/product-reviews/0615724531/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Do not be deceived by this heresy. Just because they change the words of the Bible to try to allude to something else doesn't mean it actually changes the mind of God and He still sees all with a very watchful eye. Do not lead yourself into believing the lies of men and risking your salvation! There is a battle going on and it is for your soul.

I let a life in my younger years in which I thought sexual orientation and the Bible oxy morons. I thought that being gay was incompatible with Christianity. Then I started studying the so called clobber passages. In the New Testament , Paul used The Greek words malakoi and arsenokoitai to describe pagan behavior in the Roman religion, such as, sex acts in temples (temple prostitution, etc) which were at odds with his teaching. The word homosexuality was coined in 1892 in a text on variations in sex practices, a scientific work. In the 1940’s these two Greek words were re-translated “homosexual”. Malakoi literally means soft, not homosexual. In fact, the same word was used in Matthew in which Jesus was referring to softe clothing. This word was traditionally translated as morally weak or effeminate (a reference to, again, temple prostitutes). Arsenakoitai is a word that is in rare use in the Greek world during the time of Paul’s ministry but never translated as such except in modern English translates of the Bible written in a era of extreme homophobia. I could go on and on. The reviews of this version of the Holy Scriptures here are mostly based up that homophobia and not sound Biblical exegesis. They are also ignoring other passages, such as, Jesus’ the two commandments that Jesus gave us, Love God, Love others. He said that all of God’s word was summed up in those two commandments. How is the language of these reviews showing fulfillment of the commandment to love others as yourself?
This version is based upon the original KJV and the language is, of course, archaic. It also does not address the over abundance of gender exclusive language, that no longer holds cultural relevance. We must always take scripture in context of the time it was written. When the scriptures were written, women and children were treated as property. Today, we recognize the value of women as equals of men, and that they always have been, by God’s original design. There is a great translation that addresses this issue: Today’s New International Version. It was discontinued by the producer and publisher of it due to the backlash from the Evangelicals who hold patriarchy as sacred. It, however, does not address the clobber passages. I wish the two concepts could be combined in one version.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

You can ""interpret"" but you can't ""re-write"" history.","July 30, 2015","I have to warn you, as a gay believer, ordained minister, and secular religious scholar with a Doctor of Divinity, I think you're wasting your money buying this book--Why you ask? Because it's essentially a King James Bible that has been edited incorrectly to completely change the words of several key passages. As a minister, I personally use the NRSV and the NASB because through 30 years of research, I find them to be the most accurate, word-for-word translations of the original Scriptures. What these authors fail to realize is, you can ""interpret"" the bible verses but you can't re-write them... you can't re-write history.

I'll admit, some sects of Christianity have done their own disservice to the Bible by using it as a battering ram against those they disagree with instead of using it to teach people about Christ, and that is inexcusable, too, and Jesus says so MANY times throughout the Bible. As Pastor Dewey Smith just said last weekend, ""You can't evangelize, and antagonize, at the same time!"" Very true.

My point here is that, believer or non-believer, don't take a work such as the Bible and completely change verses to suit your agenda... Research it, find out the true meanings of verses, but don't put your own words in there. God loves everyone and if everyone actually read their Bibles, they'd see that for themselves.

As a side-note, I have to mention this since we're talking about the KJV here. In my opinion, and the opinion of many of us scholars, the KJV is one of the most inaccurate Bible translations in history. It was rushed in order to get it published before a competitor and in the process, verses were inaccurately translated, entire verses are missing, and some new stuff was added by overzealous ""translators"" of the time. Instead of buying this perverted version of the original KJV, save your money and pick up a NRSV or NASB Bible... even better if you can find an annotated or study version because the religious scholars and translators give commentary on many of the Bible's verses.

Revelation 22
New King James Version (NKJV)

A Warning:

18 For I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book;
19 and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.
I Am Coming Quickly.
20 He who testifies to these things says, ""Surely I am coming quickly.""
Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus!
21 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

Maybe these same people are going to make these verses more gay friendly too!

Why? Let me explain. The reason for Gods word is to get us close to the Creator through his son Jesus Christ. God is love and there's no darkness in him at all, so we are lying if we say that we have a relationship with the creator but keep on living in spiritual darkness (in wickedness). Now, some have said that there are missing verses in this book, it takes all the verses about same-sex relationships out. If so, and it is as they say then there's a huge problem. For Gods word is perfect and it keeps us from evil.

But, how can a book others have altered help me? That's the main question. The answer is, It can't. This is why the regular king James says, ""And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book."" and yes it will, but how?

Because by removing the holy instructions to live a Godly life you are closing your ears so you do not hear. You are operating in transgression and unbelief rather than obedience to Gods word. The word brings conviction in which conviction leads us to repentance and repentance leads us to obedience and obedience brings us to salvation by obeying Gods word. So, without conviction of wrongdoing, you cannot come to God because by ignoring your convictions and commandment to turn around (repent) you are rejecting the son of God (Christ) in which through him God brings his mercy to you. This Queen James takes away passages that should bring a person to repentance through conviction. That conviction is actually a gift from God.

So, now you might say, "" Well that's not true because we are saved by faith not by works."" Ok, then answer me this question. When you give your mother, father, son or friend care for their wounds or get them something to eat because they are hungry or help them up from a chair because they are too ill to do so themselves, do you consider that work? Or, you just don't think about it because you are just doing it out of love? Yes, out of love. So, if it's done out of love, is it really work? No. It's out of love. For if it would have been working then that means Christ did works when he healed and died on the Cross for us. No. Christ died out of love, out of Agape love for us. He died for us out of undeserving love while we were still sinners. Yes, we were not born yet but he included us in his marvelous grace and Gods kindness when he died on the cross.

You might say, ""But now, you are confusing me. Are we saved by works or not?"" No. We are not saved by works. We are saved by faith alone. You might say, ""well i have faith, I do believe in Christ and everything the bible says"". I'm sure that's what you believe. But, let me ask you another question. What is believe?

For Christ when he was speaking to Thomas said, ""You believe because you have seen me. Blessed are those who believe without seeing me.""

So, clearly believing is not just in seeing. Because Christ said, ""Blessed are those who believe without seeing me."" So, it's not just about seeing.
Now you might say, ""Yes, because Thomas saw him but I didn't and I believe. I I'm blessed  because I didn't see him but still believe""
So, answer me another question. Why did Jesus tell Thomas ""be faithless no more, believe"" after he said, ""You believe because you have seen me. Blessed are those who believe without seeing me.""?

Because Thomas didn't believe when Mary Magdalene told the rest of the apostles about how she saw Jesus at the tomb. Some ran back in belief, in hopes that Jesus resurrected as he said he would and Thomas stayed behind in unbelief although he saw Jesus and walked with him for 3 years. He didn't believe or had doubts that Jesus would really resurrect, therefore because of his unbelief he was not able to ""act"" in belief. Your actions follow in what you believe in.

Judas also walked with Jesus for 3 years. But since he stole from the offerings he was also operating in unbelief. So, the Bible tells us that Judas fell head first. Which means, Satan had convinced him and through the Pharisees to betray Jesus because he did what his mind (human thinking) told him to do instead of listening to Jesus. In other words, he disobeys the teachings of our Lord and teacher Jesus Christ to follow Satan. Once he made up his mind his actions followed. For when the scriptures said when Jesus gave him the bread, Satan entered him. This was because Judas had already "" made up his mind"" (Human Thinking) and once he did Satan when from his mind to his heart and that manifested in his actions. So, yes Judas hung himself by falling head first.

For if I tell you as you approach a fork on the road, ""Listen, don't go left because you fall into a ditch and die but, the road on the right leads you to a nice hotel with free lodging and food."" You can say, you believe me but, your actions will confirm your true beliefs. If you say you believe me but then go left, your actions prove that you didn't believe me after all. You didn't have faith in what I said even though you said you did. Because we all want to live. Unless you want to die. If you really want to die you will disobey my instruction.

For we all have faith. God has given us all a measure of faith so we have it in us. Some people put their faith in their money, cars, wife, husband or just other people. Believers have their faith in God alone. They put him first. True Christians ask and consult with God first and then he guides them. They show their faith in God by obeying and loving his commandments. Faith is short for faithful and no faith is just faithless.

Were are not saved by works meaning: we are not saved by our own opinions on how to please God. We are saved by obeying God and doing what he said pleases him. Big difference.

So although grace is free and undeserved and we can clearly read and understand the words, what does it mean?
Our free gift is Christ meaning; the word of God that came down from heaven and became human (The Messiah - Jesus). It's free because the worse sinner can pick-up a bible, read it, come to repentance, turn from his sins and be saved by obeying Christ. It is 100 percent FREE. No work needed.

Now, to remain saved ""requires"" obedience to all Gods words and commands. They are requirements.

Wake up! Strengthen what little remains, for even what is left is almost dead. I find that your actions do not meet the requirements of my God. (Revelation 3:2)

Even Jesus had to meet these requirements:

 but I will do what the Father requires of me, so that the world will know that I love the Father. Come, let’s be going. (John 14:31)

What are the requirements?
1) You must love your God
2) Love your neighbor as yourself

What does love your God means? How can I show love to a God I can't see? How can I show him that I love him?

What does God say?

Loving God means keeping his commandments, and his commandments are not burdensome. (1 John 5:3)

Another verse:

Jesus replied, “All who love me will do what I say. My Father will love them, and we will come and make our home with each of them. Anyone who doesn’t love me will not obey me. And remember, my words are not my own. What I am telling you is from the Father who sent me. (John 14:23-24)

How can we know a person is angry? By their angry expressions and actions. That's the evidence of their anger since anger starts as an invisible feeling inside the person. We don't know it's there until it can be visually seen when it's manifested by actions.

True faith works in the same way. Faith is an internal feeling that manifest by doing good works. Yes, by obeying God through Christ and living an obedient, good, kind and honest life.

How can we follow Gods instructions if we remove what we don't like just so we can keep the actions God hates? How can that please God? How are we showing God our love in that way?

The opposite of love is hate. Not loving God is hating God.

Christ said it himself:

“Anyone who isn’t with me opposes me, and anyone who isn’t working with me is actually working against me. (Matthew 12:30)

God loves everyone. But to enter Gods house you must listen to the owner of the house to remain in his house.

The evidence of my love for everyone is shown here. My time in typing this review. I want everyone to be happy worry free and saved just as I, through Christ was saved in 2014 when I first opened the Bible and actually read it and obeyed it.

Conclusion:

If the book of instructions (the bible) is the most important book we should know, how effective it will be if we let someone rip pages or delete passages from it? How good will a carrot cake taste if we allow someone to excludes some of the ingredients? Neither can the bible can bring you to salvation if you do not obey it. Loving God means keeping his commandments. Yes, God loves us. Yes, he loves us all. Yes, even sinners. But, Jesus PROVED that when he died on the cross for us all. So, his two commandments in which is, love your God and love each other does to include his love for us that he already proved. These two requirements are not based on his love for us rather, based on our love for him, because he already showed us how much he loves us.

How do we know that we love him? By doing what he says. For the scriptures say, ""You must be holy because I am holy.

James 1:23-25 New Living Translation (NLT)
23 For if you listen to the word and don’t obey, it is like glancing at your face in a mirror. 24 You see yourself, walk away, and forget what you look like. 25 But if you look carefully into the perfect law that sets you free, and if you do what it says and don’t forget what you heard, then God will bless you for doing it.

Listening and Doing - James 1:19-27 (NLT)

19 Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters: You must all be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry. 20 Human anger does not produce the righteousness God desires. 21 So get rid of all the filth and evil in your lives, and humbly accept the word God has planted in your hearts, for it has the power to save your souls.

22 But don’t just listen to God’s word. You must do what it says. Otherwise, you are only fooling yourselves. 23For if you listen to the word and don’t obey, it is like glancing at your face in a mirror. 24 You see yourself, walk away, and forget what you look like. 25 But if you look carefully into the perfect law that sets you free, and if you do what it says and don’t forget what you heard, then God will bless you for doing it.

26 If you claim to be religious but don’t control your tongue, you are fooling yourself, and your religion is worthless. 27 Pure and genuine religion in the sight of God the Father means caring for orphans and widows in their distress and refusing to let the world corrupt you.

Is all about Listening to Gods word and doing what he says... How can we know what he wants us to do if passages are missing?

The Lord is coming. We are in the last hour. Repent and turn to God for his kingdom is near.

May the Lord Bless you. I truly LOVE YOU ALL with the love of Christ <3","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Queen-James-Bible-God/product-reviews/0615724531/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Do you not know that the unrighteous WILL NOT inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor HOMOSEXUALS, nor SODOMITES, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.

LEVITICUS 18:22
""You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.

ROMANS 6:23
For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

GALATIANS 6:7-8
7 Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap. 8 For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.

ROMANS 1:26-32
God gave them up to DISHONORABLE  PASSIONS. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; 27 and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.
28 And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. 29 They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, 30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, 31 foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. 32 Though they know God’s righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice

How sad for so many that scoff and jeer and laugh in their short-lived pride. They are on that wide road to destruction. Even if Someone were to rise from the dead and tell them, they would not believe it. For now, they can indeed ""take away me, but they will never take away God!""

Gods position on Homosexuality has not changed – He destroyed the World once & he destroyed two cities called Sodom & Gomorrah – Christ’s Return is near – Don’t miss it for the world. Matthew 24:37-39
37But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
38For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,
39And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
Luke 17:28-30
28Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they build;
29But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.
30Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.

All you need to know about its intellectual rigour is in the description: ""Homosexuality was first mentioned in the Bible in 1946."" This is quite true, but fails to recognize two blatantly obvious facts. Firstly, the English Bible is a translation. Obviously the original texts of the Bible couldn't have used the word 'homosexual' because it is not Greek, Aramaic, or Hebrew. Secondly, the word ""homosexual"" was created in the late 19th century. Hence, the King James Bible, which had almost nothing to do with King James except flattery, did not use the word because it didn't exist. The same goes for the Geneva Bible and those translated by Tyndale and Wycliffe. If you happen to read the Bible in the original texts, it speaks against homosexual acts pretty blatantly.

The 'translators' argue that homosexuality can't be a serious issue because it is only mentioned in 8 verses out of thousands (not true, but I'll grant the premise). I'd like to see that defence in court, ""Your honour, the law can't be serious about theft being illegal because it is only mentioned 8 times in the criminal code.""

If you want to resolve any ambiguity in what the Bible says, don't perform a predictably comedic edit of a 400 year old translational masterpiece. Learn ancient Hebrew, Greek, or Aramaic and read the original for yourself.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Queen-James-Bible-God/product-reviews/0615724531/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have researched the originals in Hebrew and Greek. And the ignorance of most of these commentaries is obvious. God denounce sodomy when He destroyed the city of Sodom around 2300 B.C. The very term sodomy came from the name of the city of Sodom, which was destroyed for this abominable sin. Leviticus 20:13 declares ""if a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them."" So what if it doesn't use the word homosexuality, if a man lies with a man as he would lie with a woman, they have committed an abomination.

In Romans 1:26-27 ""For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet (aids).""

Words to describe this sin: vile affections; unnatural (against nature); unseemly.

You can change your ""interpreation"" or your ""book"" but you cannot change God. God would repeal the dietary laws, and the laws pertaining specifically to Israel (circumscision), but He never repealed the moral laws. Adultery, fornication, and sodomy are still wicked and sinful. God calls them an abomination.

Poeple want to change the Bible to fit thier lifestyle, instead of changing their lives to line up with the Bible. If your opposed to what the Bible says about your sin, why don't you just ignore the Bible altogether? Why go about to change a book you don't beleive anyway?

I have before me a Bible that was given to my mother when she was 10 years old.  It is dated  Sept. 30 1928.  I suspect this Bible was given to her on her First Communion.  I cannot inquire because my mother passed away in 1973.

Anyway, with the 1946 claim in mind, I proceeded to look up Romans 1:24-27.  Here is how that passage reads in this Bible:

24""Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness, through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:

25Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed forever.  Amen.

26For this cause God gave them unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:

27And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working this is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet.

Now the word ""homosexuality is not used in the above passages, and I'm not sure if that is the claim of the other side, but it is clear the passage is about homosexuality.

The 1946 claim made in conjunction with the Bible currently being reviewed is clearly false!","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Queen-James-Bible-God/product-reviews/0615724531/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_37?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=37&reviewerType=all_reviews"

These are precisely the last days Scripture predicted when a motley collection of sodomites, attempting to use God's Own inspired Word to destroy itself, comes forth with the epitome of blasphemy.

If there was a ""0"" star rating for this, it would be deserving of it.

May all true Christians get down on bended knee and petition Almighty God and our Saviour to open the eyes and hearts of these hell-bound sodomites that they may be convicted of the gross, blasphemous error of their ways and repent and accept salvation before it is too late.  There is not much time left in the Day of Grace and unquestionably these individuals are sorely in dire need of salvation as their souls hang on the very edge of the abyss.

God loves the sinner but he hates the sin.  It in no wise shall enter into Heaven.

""He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.""

--Prov. 29:1

""And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.

For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: 19And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.

The Bible, as has often been observed, is not a book -- it is a library of books, with different authors, in different genres, composed over hundreds of years -- yet there is a remarkable consistency in the vision of human nature, human sexuality and family life, from the beginning of Genesis to the end of Revelation. From the historical books through the historical books to the Wisdom literature, psalms and Song of Songs, the prophets with their bridal imagery for Isael, the epistles -- the same vision of human nature and human sexuality pervased the whole.

And there's no point to the oft-heard objection that 'Jesus says nothing about homosexuaity."" There was nothing to say. The teaching was resolved. He wasn't shy about innovating (""and thus did He declare all foods clean""). But on this point there was no need to innovate.

Other writings claiming to be the gospels of this or the gospel according to so and so, making all kinds of outrageous claims from a married Jesus to a homosexual Jesus. Many have denied the Bible's Truth, even tried to burn them all out of existence. Stamping out public prayer, in schools and in govt. halls. Denying our nation was founded by men of Christian faith, for Christian faith. Banning crosses and Nativity scenes. Burning churches and martyring believers.

It is the story of God's revelation to His creation and it provides very deliberate truth that many will find offensive.

There are specific passages that have been altered in this book that was previously a translation of the Bible referred to as the King James Version (KJV) which is a translation that exists in the public domain.

 To set the record straight, the fairly recent appearance of the word “homosexuality” in Bible translation is no indication that it wasn’t a biblical issue prior to the mid-20th century. The term does not appear in English Bibles before 1946 simply because it was not an English word until just a few decades earlier, and even then it took some time to come into common use.

Here are five notable changes (there are more) made in creating this book (which by record of change disqualifies it as a translation of the Bible).

1. Genesis 19:5
ORIGINAL TEXT:  And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.

MODIFIED TEXT:  And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night?  Bring them out unto us, that we may rape and humiliate them (QJV pg. 21)

2. Leviticus 18:22
ORIGINAL TEXT:  Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.

MODIFIED TEXT:  Thou shall not lie with mankind as with womankind in the temple of Molech: it is an abomination (QJV pg. 75)

3. Leviticus 20:13
ORIGINAL TEXT:  If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

MODIFIED TEXT:  If a man also lie with mankind in the temple of Molech, as he leith with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. (QJV pg. 76)

4. Romans 1:26-27
ORIGINAL TEXT:  For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:
And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet.

MODIFIED TEXT:  Their women did change their natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, left of the natural use of the woman, burned in ritual lust, one toward another, Men with men working that which is pagan and unseemly. For this cause God gave the idolators up unto vile affections, receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet. (QJV pg. 545)

5. 1 Corinthians 6:9-10
ORIGINAL TEXT:  Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.

MODIFIED TEXT:  Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?  Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor morally weak, nor promiscuous, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. (QJV) (Page 554)

The prideful have now established a new level of apostasy as they seek to create God in their image.

The Queen James Version of the Bible is nothing more than a reprint of the 1769 edition of the King James Version of the Bible. The only modification is the removal of so-called “homophobic interpretations” in a total of eight verses (five referenced above).

Without the aid of modern technology, in the early 19th century Thomas Jefferson started with the same Bible and used a razor and glue to literally cut and paste sections of the New Testament to exclude the portions about Jesus with which he disagreed. How is this any different?

The credentials of the QJV editors cannot be evaluated because the editors have chosen to remain anonymous. But their general estimation of God’s word is evident in their brazen charge that “the Bible is still filled with inequality and even contradiction,” plus their shameless efforts to alter the biblical text to suit their own agenda (cf. 2 Peter 3:16-17).

We were ALL once lost, but now the true followers of Jesus that ascribe to the full council of God and acknowledge and repent of all sins are found.

May we pray that the amazing grace of God's truth cut through these lies of manmade edits to God's word, and bring those who seek the truth into an eternal saving relationship with Jesus.

And it’s puzzling how the QJV editors could reconcile Revelation 22:19 after making these “edits” to the Bible to create something altogether different.

Revelation 22:19 says:  and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Queen-James-Bible-God/product-reviews/0615724531/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. 8 But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God’s curse! 9 As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let them be under God’s curse!

You shall not lie with a male as with a woman. It is an abomination.

Deuteronomy 22:5

“A woman shall not wear anything that pertains to a man, nor shall a man put on a woman’s garment, for all who do so are an abomination to Jehovah your God.

Leviticus 20:13

If a man lies with a male as he lies with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall surely be put to death. Their blood shall be upon them.

I Timothy 1:8-11

But we know that the law is  good if one uses it lawfully, knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine, according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God which was committed to my trust.

Romans 1:26-27

For this reason God gave them up to vile passions. For even their women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature. Likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust for one another, men with men committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due.

I Corinthians 6:9-11

Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.

Ibach","This is just WRONG!","December 14, 2012","You wrote ""Regarding your comments on homosexuality: as a homosexual and a Christian I do find your argument reasonable but ultimately objectionable.""

""Our arguments are reasonable only because they are based on Scripture and not fallible man's ideas. Since we base our arguments on God's Word, any objection you may have is with what God has said, not with what we have said.

You state you are a ""homosexual and a Christian."" This sort of statement seems more of a setup than a genuine confession of a struggle. It seems you have a few motives to state this: 1) you may want an emotional response from us saying ""you are not Christian, because you are a homosexual""; 2) you are attempting to justify your behavior; and/or 3) you are trying to set yourself up as an authority above what the Bible says about homosexuality.

I would like to point out that I do not know your heart (only God knows your heart--Psalm 44:21; Acts 15:8), so I will take your word that you are a Christian. I understand that no Christian is perfect (including myself), and we all have struggles (Romans 3:23; 7:14-21). But just because we may struggle with something does not mean we are justified in doing it. Your statement above is akin to someone saying ""I am a drunkard and a Christian and I object to your arguments against drunkenness"" or ""I am an adulterer and a Christian and I object to your arguments against adultery."" Someone subscribing to a certain lifestyle or behavior and then claiming to be a Christian does not negate the fact that it is a sin.

But, this sort of reasoning follows the rejection of Genesis as literal history. For if Genesis is rejected, then other ""disagreeable"" parts of the Bible will be rejected as well. So then how does anyone know which parts are true and which parts are untrue? Genesis is the foundation of the Bible and the Gospel, and therefore is the foundation for Christ's birth, life, death, and resurrection; thus, it is the foundation for salvation and being a Christian. For if we believe Christ died for an allegory then how do we know that salvation is not just an allegory? For then we are to be pitied most among men (1 Corinthians 15:19-21).

The only interpretation that counts is God's interpretation (2 Peter 1:20-21). There is no reason to trust interpretations when God already tells us how to interpret His Word (plainly/straightforward in 2 Corinthians 4:2 and Proverbs 8:8-9). Regardless of what any man or culture says, God's truth is always relevant. And only truth about what is sin and what is not sin can come from Him, because He does not change like the culture (Numbers 23:19; 1 Samuel 15:29; Malachi 3:6; Hebrews 13:8). He is the all-knowing, ever-truthful, always-relevant God.""

David Wright, AiG-USA

Am I missing something, or is this nondisclosure (which no Bible translation does, almost all give at least a partial list of translators) a blatant act of cowardice? Are they afraid? If they are, it begs the question-do they know that they can't defend their work and therefore remain hidden to avoid critique, and/or are they just doing this because this translation is virtually the first of its kind and has the potential to sell well?

Also, the excuses they gave for substantially changing these 8 verses are pathetic. I don't believe in anywhere near this level of translation anyway-see The Message-its better to translate the actual Bible (the original languages) into English as close as you can with the ORIGINAL just making it readable by putting it in current grammar and style. Shouldn't we want to read the bible, God's word, as close to what the original writers wrote, and discuss the verses in their most original form? If your so emphatic and confident about these verses being wrong, then you should learn yourself how they are wrong, and argue with Christians against homosexuals using the real, unabridged text.

And lastly, though it has the potential to sell well, it will only be because of two things: 1. Homosexuals will buy it only because it will help their cause, and 2. Homosexuals will buy it because they are too stupid to realize their being conned. Look, as other reviewers have mentioned, these people, whoever they are (LOL!)are taking the entire KJV bible, which is public domain in America (they don't have to pay royalties etc, and I can download the KJV on hundreds if not thousands of places legally on the internet for free) changing 8 verses, putting it in book form, and then charging you $34.95 for it. And guys, it not even a leather/fake leather, not even a hardback but a paperback they are charging you for. Compare this to the ESV study bible in paperback: it's a new, ""expensive"" translation which includes about 20,000 study notes, as well as various maps, charts, extensive cross-references and a concordance. And guess how much it costs, on amazon like the QJV: $18.53.

Everything about the QJK is frankly sickening, and you don't have to be against homosexual activity and  homosexual marriage to agree with me.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Queen-James-Bible-God/product-reviews/0615724531/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I rated it one star because there are no negative stars or anything below one star.

Martin Luther claimed that anyone can interpret the Bible, so I ask the protestants this question: If anyone can interpret the Bible for themselves and it's still valid, then wouldn't this bible also be correct? For those who see errors in this bible, if you think the Bible is self-interpreting and still valid, then you have to accept this one too. Truth and non-truth cannot co-exist. I can't fill a glass with water to the top and declare with truth that it's both full and empty.

The Bible is NOT open for interpretation. No document is self-interpreting. All bibles do NOT say the same thing ""just in different ways."" Some of the differences are night and day while others vary.

King James of England, on whose bible this is based, was not exactly on the ""straight"" and narrow...literally. So the KJV and all the bibles who have recycled the KJV into other translations all risk carrying with it those errors.

No document is self-interpreting, not even the Bible. To interpret the Bible one needs more than just a knowledge of Greek and Hebrew. Knowledge of just the languages in which the Bible was written without the Holy Spirit, knowledge of Sacred Tradition and the Church is like having a car and gas but no map and no idea of getting where you want to go. You have the means but are lost with no direction. That's one of the reasons we have the Church, the Bride of Christ, and Christ and his Church are one. Christ was not a polygamist. Matrimony is first and foremost a sacrament in the Church but also a human symbol of Christ's unity and oneness with the Church. When you get married, do you become one with thousands upon thousands of people? Or just one? There is one bride and one groom.

There is one Bible and one Church: the Holy Catholic Church. If you do not believe me, then ask yourself from whom did we first get the Bible and its compilation and organization? The Holy Catholic Church. Before anyone claims this, my message is not ""hate speech."" If you were walking on the street and about to fall down an open sewer hole, I would shout at you to stop, look and avoid the hole, but who would interpret the shouting as abusive or hatred when the intent is to save a life or at least avoid a terribly nasty injury?

Those passages have been misquoted more times than probably any other part of the texts often ignoring the message of what was ACTUALLY being talked about. Sodom was not about being gay but about not welcoming strangers. In fact, this man of God that is so good in all these other ""versions"" offered his three virgin daughters to be raped by the town people rather than throw out total strangers. Talk about sick and disgusting! Fact, the Christian Bible has already been rewritten many times. Look at a version of a few hundred years ago and now. You will see huge difference and not only on homosexuality but even on heaven and hell. Early versions talked about reincarnation not a paradise on a cloud in Never never land. These messed up fanatics need to learn there junk a bit better! Is this a more accurate version as say the KJV or the NIV? Honestly, I think its probably about the same. King James had some major paranoia which he did add to his version so I think some would be in this as well. Not the re writing of the gay passages which are more correctly told here but just in the whole text. I really don't care ether way. I am not a Christian. I am ordained but I left the Church long ago. I only wanted to compare it to others and knew people of the church and those who are anti-gay bigots would be all over this. It's another version of the Christian Bible.

But then realized $35 for a wooden trophy which never will be opened is way too much :)

To be honest I don't see what audience this book is targeting. I even see gay people don't like it. If you are Christian and you are serious about God, looking for His wisdom, His Will and His True Word for you (no matter you gay or straight) and you have doubts about some verses that you think are not right, open up original language (Greek for New Testament, Hebrews/Aramaic for Old Testament) find that passages and study their meaning in the context, word by word (there are so many tools to do so even if you do not know original language) and you will have much bigger chances to know the legit true meaning of particular verse/s.

To me it's so funny to read in the description of this book ""Homosexuality was first mentioned in the Bible in 1946, in the Revised Standard Version. There is no mention of or reference to homosexuality in any Bible prior to this - only interpretations have been made."" Of course King James can't use this word because this word simply didn't exist in English language that time, up until 20 century. They used another words for that, the one in particular: ""sodomites"". So in the: 1 Timothy 1:9-10 ""knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine"" so in original Greek translation of this verses it is used αρσενοκοιται instead of word sodomites, which means ""man that is looking for sexual relationship with another man"" bible is very clear on the subject of homosexuality and it calls it SIN among all other sins like murders, liars, etc. Thank God because of God's grace we live in the time of the New Testament where we are not been put to death by been caught in sinning but He gives us a chance to repent and live new life.

Bottom line: I think this is not more then just another provocation book, which has nothing to do with real Christianity and real Bible.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Queen-James-Bible-God/product-reviews/0615724531/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews"

How is it that St. Basil the Great who died in 379 saw the same thing and advocated that a person who committed an homosexual act should be excommunicated for 30 years. For For that matter if the Holy Scriptures did not condemn homosexuality, why is it that all Christians since Pentecost, Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant have consistently taught that homosexual acts are sinful. This work is nothing but a fraud, which rewrites a few verses of the Bible to conform to the pro-gay agenda. It it not only intellectually dishonest but shows the moral bankruptcy of the pro-gay movement if they have to resort to outright fraud to support their cause.

That would be the Received Text, Accepted Text, Alexandrian Text, and the Critical Text.  That just about covers all the bases.

For those that are not sure about the original texts of the Holy Bible, the vast majority of manuscripts fall into one of the four categories above.  There are debates as to which is more accurate.  However, it is mute in the case of homosexuality.

All four of them agree!  Homosexuality is a violation of God's Law.  It is one of the few things that the Church has NEVER had any doubts about - until now, in the End Times.  That alone speaks volumes.

Except in a few cases, any Bible you hold in your hands came from one of the four texts listed above, and they all agree in nearly every point.  There are differences to be sure, but nothing that the Lord cannot get you past when you seek His understanding above all things.

One more thing - if the ""authors"" of this ""bible"" felt free to clear up the ""mistakes"" they found in the Bible, where exactly do they stop?  What other ""mistakes"" will they see fit to ""correct""?

These are the same folks that like to argue that men manipulated the Bible to push an agenda.
