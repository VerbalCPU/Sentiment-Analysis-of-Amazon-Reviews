But then I remembered, I don't know what a blue ray is or what it's for. Then I thought ""Maybe I could use the discs as rings!"" But there are 30 discs and I only have 20 measly fingers!! Still, such a precious find has to be in my possession. So somewhere between second breakfast and lunch I took upon figuring out where in my hobbit hole I could find 719.99 ""U.S. dollhairs"", but that proved to be a futile adventure! Obviously U. S. stands for Uruk-hai of Sauron, and we all know they don't own dolls. Forget about finding those hairs in my little old hobbit hole.

It is nice to see the glowing 4 and 5 star reviews from what appears to be WB employees, but I highly doubt anyone here is stupid enough to pay $799 or even $499 for what is nothing more than a rehashing of movies already produced, in fancy packaging. For those who are stupid enough to pay $83 apiece [based on the $499 'sale' price] for 6 movies that add no additional footage to what we already have, knock yourselves out.

Bad move for the ole coin-purse.

The wooden holder is extremely sturdy and Bilbo Baggin's book 'mini-replica' is mainly filled with the character sketches seen within the ending credits of the ROTK and Hobbit movies. The disc booklets are also quite nice, although, one disc had some glue damage.

You're not just buying 6 movies, but also the previously released extras found with the original theatrical, theatrical/extended and extended releases for the LOTR movies. For some reason, only the TV spots are located on the 'special features' DVDs and the trailers removed (along with older video game previews). The trailers are supposed to be located on the BDs along with the movie, but for the life of me, I cannot find them. As previously stated in other reviews, ad nauseum (rightfully so), it's just a shame new material wasn't allowed to be released -- hopefully one day.

My biggest complaint with the release are the DVDs... every single one during playback on either my new BD player or computer have huge glitches that happen for almost every long segment.

When New Line released the LOTR movies, the packaging was wonderful -- TimeWarner Hobbit packaging is so flimsy for the movies and soundtracks. I know we live in a 'quantity over quality' world, but New Line made it feel like you were getting both, TimeWarner... not so much. At least for this release, the packaging is wonderful, but the content is very 'ho-hum' and DVD disc quality is under par.","3.0 out of 5 stars","",""

WHV just wants to make more money by releasing old content without anything added. I made a comment elsewhere in reply to someone else that if I was to buy this, it should not only include the Arkenstone (because they mentioned the Arkenstone as something that, if added, would make the price reasonable), but a two-foot miniature of Smaug AND the One Ring.
I should have added, ""in addition to other things"". And it doesn't include any NEW things from the films? Not interested. I have lots of wood and can make my own Middle Earth ""bookshelf"" and I am quite capable of making my own Leather (or Faux Leather, depending on how creative a mood I'm in) cases for much cheeper. WHV screwed up big this time around.
I'm not going to spend $800 for something I already have. And neither should anyone else; you can get all of these movies-extended edition-for less than $133.

While 76% of the reviews of this box set are negative vs 19% positive, it clearly shows that the 76% who gave this box set one star, just don't get it. Why are there still young people from good stable homes, who leave everything behind in order to follow the remains of the Grateful dead, or Pearl Jam on tour, eating Ramen noodles, sleeping in cardboard boxes? Is the devotion to a band, or in this case, a movie, so great that the $800= retail price is but a trifle amount to pay for years of enjoyment and personal illumination, that no sacrifice is too great to achieve this pleasure?  Many complain about the lack of ""lost footage"", but they fail to appreciate the beauty of the project - the do not see The Big Picture.
Case in point ""The Beatles"". This year (2017) marks the 50th anniversary of the greatest and best rock album of all time, ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"". The record has been released and re-released, as well as remastered over and over again through the years multiple times, so, why would someone pay $150- for the same album that's been available worldwide in almost every corner on Earth?  Because this year, they are remixing the Stereo album, re-mastering the mono vinyl, and publishing a book with previously unreleased photos of The Beatles! But that's not all... You also get a full Bly Ray disc of altetrnative versions and outtakes.
It is the same for this box set: it may appear to contain the same material as before, but this time, they have maps, a book, and remixed and remastered versions of the film. When 50 years have passed, Warner Home VIdeo will then release The Lost Footage. Until then, enjoy this beautiful box set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Middle-earth-Limited-Collectors-Blu-ray-DVD/product-reviews/B01JH3KL0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I LOVE Lord of the Rings. I LOVE The Hobbit. I bought LOTR Extended Edition on DVD (no no, don't be silly, why would I buy the theatrical version?). Then I sold it, so I can get the LOTR Extended Edition on Blu Ray. Watched it multiple times and STILL LOVE IT. Then I bought The Hobbit 3D Extended Edition on Blu Ray. LOVE IT! I thought the price was reasonable for all that I've bought so I've got no complains, and I ALWAYS waited for the Extended Editions. However, I echo the sentiments of many for THIS USD$800 uber-super-limited-edition-collection of all the previous movies minus some material here and there, but full of packaging that will only serve to profit Warner Bros without any real extra value over previous releases. Now that, is just plain wrong. What's to stop a $2000 version of a 3D version of a uber-super-limited-edition-collection of the movies from Warner? There are good profits and there are bad profits for companies. This, my friends, is bad profit.

I am a fan of the series and own both the LOTR and Hobbit extended blu ray collections. Normally I’m a sucker for limited and collector’s editions but this not worth the price. This was originally $800 but the back lash was so epic they dropped the price but it’s still way overpriced. The only thing different in this set is that it comes with the wooden shelf and a different box. There is literally nothing else different. There are no extra bonus features or documentaries added. Even Peter Jackson said he could have done more featurettes but they decided not to do that.

I bought both my blu ray extended edition collections for $75. At full price you might pay $100. Now you have to ask yourself if you think that little wooden shelf is worth $400","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Middle-earth-Limited-Collectors-Blu-ray-DVD/product-reviews/B01JH3KL0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The quality is excellent. I'm disappointed, however, that there was not any new footage included in this set (hence the four stars instead of five). I know there are scenes that have not yet been released and it would have meant the Absolute World to all of the Tolkien and LOTR movie fans if the material had been added. I own all of the extended versions of the films and have watched all of the behind the scenes DVDs more than just a couple of times from all six of the extended edition films. For example, it would have been amazing to see Miranda Otto wield the sword as Eowyn, in the Glittering Caves, during the Battle of the Hornburg. I'm thankful that Peter Jackson had the foresight to film behind the scenes throughout the making of the films and that he shared so much with all of us. Maybe someday there will be an effort by  The Studio or ""The Corporate Powers That Be"" to support him in rendering the remaining footage for all of us that truly love it so.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Middle-earth-Limited-Collectors-Blu-ray-DVD/product-reviews/B01JH3KL0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I knew that Warner Bros. would eventually make a huge set with all of ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" films in one big package. I bought the Harry Potter Wizards collection back in 2012 and the price wasn't a deal breaker for me nor was it an issue. I knew this would be the same type of release as well, only I was aware that no new material was being created for it.

I'm still okay with it as this massive set already contains more bonus materials than I would ever imagine or have the time to go over. What I was looking for was a set that contained the extended editions because I will never watch the theatrical cuts again. I don't have a 3D TV so I didn't need those discs. All of the previously created extras are included in this set so I'm not missing anything from the older DVD and Blu-ray releases.

On top of that is the fantastic and beautiful packaging. I took it out of the box it was in yesterday and in person, this is one great looking collection. I think more people would appreciate this if they saw it in front of them. It really is awesome. It's simple and elegant looking. The shelf is extremely sturdy and well built. The six oversized books fit snug and perfectly on the top and the terrific journal style book with all the artwork is contained underneath along with these really nice lobby style art cards in a paper slip. The book looks exactly like the one Bilbo started to write his book in that was completed by Frodo and eventually Sam. I would have to say along with my Harry Potter Wizards Set and my Gold Breaking Bad limited edition signed barrel, that these three releases are the crowns in my home video physical media collection.

I will agree that even at $499 which is what I paid for this that it is still too expensive but it wasn't a deal breaker for me like the Potter set. I'm glad I never paid $799, but I believe a fair price for this would have been about $399 retail which would have brought it down to about $299 or a little less discounted. Paying that would have been a little more acceptable, but I still don't feel like I was ripped off as I can definitely see the quality that went into this. This isn't haphazardly put together, it's meant to last.

So, that's it. I understand the disappointment from many who expected more, but this is about perfect for me and what I was looking for in a collection like this. I'm not disappointed but I get why many are. I will get a lot out of this collection. Now I need to figure out when to start watching all of these discs. :-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Middle-earth-Limited-Collectors-Blu-ray-DVD/product-reviews/B01JH3KL0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They are truely some of the best films in the history of cinema. Jackson fantastically brings the world of the books to life, and does so spectacularly.

The packaging and presentation of this set are also something to behold. This set is truly gorgeous, and will certainly become the certerpiece of whatever shelf it may rest upon. There are tons of special features, in fact the most special features to reside in a single set, in comparison to any other release of these movies. The art and physical supplements included are equally detailed and gorgeous. Extended editions of each movie are included along with the theatrical and extended editions on digital.

So what's not to like? Most obviously, the price. MSRP for this set is unacceptable. $500? No. Way. Even on sale $380 is far too steep for what you get. Regardless of how big of a fan you are, justifying the amount you spend on this set is impossible because what's included, simply isn't worth it. While the special features included are expansive, they are also missing lots more extra features, many of which, haven't yet got a propper release. It also lacks the physical theatrical editions of each movie. Had Warner brothers included those in the set, it WOULD make it the one set to rule them all.

Bottom line is: this set WOULD be worth it, for $100-$150. But anything more than that simply isn't. It lacks the physical theatricals and many special features, making the ""ultimate middle Earth collection"" less ultimate, and more along the lines of ""premium"".","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Middle-earth-Limited-Collectors-Blu-ray-DVD/product-reviews/B01JH3KL0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Not for casual viewers.","May 30, 2018","I think the controversy concerning how much this thing costs should be addressed. Sure, it is very expensive, and it is not something to just purchase without any thought, as this much money could be used an many other things. However, I can say that this series of movies, in this format and presentation, is well worth the price if you are a big fan of the Lord of the Rings, and I mean a BIG fan. This ain't something you wanna buy if you are just a casual fan of the series, so if you just want the movies and think Lord of the Rings is cool, there are alot more affordable options than this one. If you are a relentless fan and love the series, then this was made for you. It looks beautiful on a shelf, is meticulously detailed, and extremely rare (thus the price.) There is no exclusive digital content however, so you are essentially buying the extended editions in a blue-ray format, just packaged up real pretty. It comes with alot of artwork, beautiful dvd cases, and makes for a stunning display, but the dvds are just the regular and average extended editions with the same extra content. Essentially, you are buying it for the beauty of it if you do decide to get it. If you don't care what the dvds come in and just wanna watch the movies, then don't buy this one, but if you want to make the Lord of the Rings the crown jewel of your dvd collection, then save up. It is worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

This has remained evident since the early 2000s with the constant, controlled re-releasing of these movies in order to suck every last dollar from us that they can.

I was gifted this item for my Birthday earlier this month, and after thinking long and hard about and reading some of the comments on here, I decided to review this item from the POV of not only a cinema aficionado, but as someone who collects movies.

As a collector, I have to say this item is absolutely gorgeous. They come in a rather sturdy and nicely crafted shelf that holds six numbered booklets that hold the movies as well as their discs with extra material. These booklets are well made and bound in what feels like imitation leather. In addition to this it also comes with a booklet that contains a lot of artwork for the movie and also has an imitation leather cover. I just wanted to point out that this box set is rather large and may not fit in most conventional dvd and blu ray shelves. As of now I am relegated to having to store it in a plastic storage bin which bums me out as this is such a nice looking set and I was set on having it on display amongst the rest of my collection.

As a cinema aficionado, this set, for lack of a better wording, upsets me. They come with the same movies and extras you would get if you purchased both trilogies separately. The movies themselves are still broken up into two discs, which happens to be one of many factors that make me prefer the theatrical releases. (It is difficult to into a movie when you have to get up and change discs to keep watching it)  The storage design is not the conventional make you see on your average dvd or blu ray cases, but rather semi circular pouches made out of a construction paper like material. No matter how hard you try, you will scratch these discs every time they are removed or inserted in their pouches, which will obviously affect the playability of these discs over time. As much as I love this set up, I purchased the theatrical edition of this collection not too soon after I received this and decided to hold onto my original extended box sets of these trilogies because they are easier to shelve and access, even if they don't look as good as a uniform boxset would.

So there you have it, I tried to be as unbiased as I could, it comes down to what your personal preferences are. If you just care for being able to own, watch, and properly maintain these films, then stick to the original box sets, but if you can afford it and are into collectables pertaining to this franchise, by all means knock yourself out as it is definitely worth it as a collectable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Middle-earth-Limited-Collectors-Blu-ray-DVD/product-reviews/B01JH3KL0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'll address the issue most complained about: no theatrical cut, only extended.  I am SO confused.  Why would you have the extended cut, and whine about not having a shorter, gutted version?  To talk about what content was deleted for the PG-13 rating?  You're a bit late, I'm afraid.  There are about 20,000,000,000 online sites devoted to pointing out every added millisecond and pixel put in or taken out to achieve their theatrical ratings.  Plus, if you're such a fanatic that such a tiny fact bothers you, then surely you saw them in theaters enough times to have those versions etched in your brain to remember eternally, right?  You certainly SHOULD, since it's apparently the most important thing ever!

NO BUY!","August 19, 2016","For over a decade, Peter Jackson has teased fans with talk of additional documentary material--series retrospectives, deleted scenes, and bloopers for all six films--and despite many of us diehard fans having purchased these films 10+ times already (first the individual theatrical releases on DVD, then the individual Extended Editions, then the box sets, then the Limited Editions with the Costa Botes documentaries, then the theatrical Blu-rays, then the extended Blu-rays, and then all over again with the Hobbit films), Warner Home Video has the temerity to turn down Jackson's proposal to produce this new material, re-package ""everything"" they've released on Blu-ray (but not the theatrical versions of the films!, wrap it up in some attractively but cheaply produced swag, call it an Ultimate Collector's Edition, and charge $800 a pop for it? WARNER: this is NOT how you treat your most dedicated repeat customers! Do you have any idea how much it says to us that you declined Jackson's new material, despite it having been advertised in commentaries on your own products for over a decade? I urge ANYONE considering buying this set, either for themselves or as a gift for that Middle-earth lover in their life, to delete this item from your basket and never look back. You can get every disc included in this set for less than $230 if you buy the previously released sets, AND you won't be rewarding Warner Home Video for flipping the bird to its fans. Yes, the swag looks nice, but this is in NO WAY an acceptable replacement for the Ultimate Collector's Edition fans have been waiting for for more than a decade. And it's certainly no way to treat a group of filmmakers whose six films each earned more than a billion dollars at the box office!

Long story short: boycott this travesty of a release! Show Warner Bros. that we don't appreciate being taken for a ride, and that they can't treat their catalog films this way and expect fans to happily fork over their money - AGAIN! - when we know there is a real ultimate edition out there that Warner refuses to produce.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Middle-earth-Limited-Collectors-Blu-ray-DVD/product-reviews/B01JH3KL0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They  didn't fight it, they embraced it, and they tried to throw the fans from the ramparts.  And so began a battle of five armies: Warner, MGM, the Tolkien Estate, Peter Jackson, and the fans.  Warner won, and then they piled their gold into a bed and took a long, contented nap.

The wooden bookcase is designed in a style befitting of Bag End, and measuring at 10.5"" x 9"" x 10"" it's a grand display set that looks fantastic on a large desk or book shelf.  The faux-leather Blu-ray cases for each movie is stunning, and the Red Book of Westmarch sketchbook is filled with wonderful drawings.  I'm very happy with this product.

At the time of this writing, Amazon sells it for $419, and I believe it's worth that price tag for serious collectors, hardcore Lord of the Rings fans, or people with a little money to burn.  I do not believe it was worth the original $800 cost.

Note: I initially received what appeared to be either a returned copy, or a store display copy.  The product box was in poor shape, and the box seal had been re-taped.  The ties on the sketchbook had been untied, and one of the Extras discs was missing (disc 21, The Two Towers Special Features).

Which you can find pictures of...well, OK, it's an alright shelf (assuming it's SOLID wood and not veneered MDF). But psssssst - Amazon sells perfectly acceptable jigsaws from around 20$ and up. Also graphite carbon paper and paint, so you could get some nice wood - walnut, cherry, etc. and make your own shelf over the weekend. Just look at the picture - that shelf wasn't lovingly crafted by New Zealand craftspeople.

How about those faux leather cases? Faux leather for that price? Well, OK, you get the Red Book. Seem to me that you could commission that kind of thing (in real leather), and besides, Amazon sells tools and books for working leather too. It's not like you are getting ORIGINAL sketches from the artists - these are prints. Reprints. Probably lovely, but then again, IMO you'd have to be a real complete-ist to spend nearly a thousand dollars for some (small) re-prints...

But most of all - most of all...you can buy the complete sets of the LOTR EEs and the Hobbit EEs on Amazon, right now, on Blu Ray, for about 140$ for both sets. IMO if you should purchase this for a loved one - well, hope your loved one is REALLY into having their bookshelves look nice (assuming the faux leather of the cases here doesn't start to peel, in time) or REALLY into art, because other than some superficially pretty packaging, there's nothing NEW here. If you are an LOTR fan or a Hobbit fan or a Peter Jackson's Middle Earth fan, IMO this set is like something the Master of Laketown would have sold, and then told folks they were ungrateful for the effort it took.

How dare we even think to expect, maybe, a special WETA-made collectible, or a book of unreleased images, or *gasp* at least a few discs of *precious* unreleased scenes for this price! Can't the *whiny* fandom understand that it's much more better, to have hours of unused scenes gathering dust in a warehouse?

My own feeling is that folks would be better served by 1) using their money to upgrade their theater/sound system, so they can enhance the viewing of what they already own; 2) Check out WETA and buy a limited edition collectible - the upcoming figure of Galadriel looks lovely; 3) put the money towards the visit-New-Zealand-in-person-fund.

Somewhere, in a dark forest, the elven king is sneering in contempt over this release at this price point. Never thought I'd review a product that hasn't even been released, but today is that day, to add to the voices of the dismayed fan community over this FAUX, overpriced, ""ultimate collection"".","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Middle-earth-Limited-Collectors-Blu-ray-DVD/product-reviews/B01JH3KL0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The first thing that caught my attention was how big it actually is. Amazon of course had it in their own packaging but once i brought it out the actual product packaging was simply amazing
I have included pictures of all 4 sides of the outer packaging with this review (I do apologize for the glare my flash made on the box)
The other very nice thing that this outer box had was that they made it so that once you undid the top tape and pulled out the lip it quite simply just ""fell"" off the actual inside foam box that holds the actual product it in. This was extremely convent because I have also purchased the Harry Potter Collectors edition and it was difficult to get out of the outer box they had it in.
Now as I stated before the actual product was very well packaged inside a foam box and once outside of the foam box I was completely and utterly sold on the entire collection.
The stand is solid wood with very nice detailing on both sides
The actual disks all come in there own ""novel"" which are all leather bound and extremely well crafted!
The extra's include Bilbo and Frodo's ""Journal"" which I haven't been able to get through completely, but just from the outside and the few pages I have gone through I can defenity tell time and effort went into this!
The other add on you get is a set of pictures from the Lord or the rings movies which is given to you in a very nice fold up

All in all I just can't express how nice, detailed and fantastic this collection is and how much it is now worth the price!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Middle-earth-Limited-Collectors-Blu-ray-DVD/product-reviews/B01JH3KL0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Anthony","A poke in the eye and a slap in the face to Hobbit/LOTR fans","August 20, 2016","This set is a poke in the eye to the true Middle Earth film fans who would want it. They've likely already spent hundreds of dollars on various versions and formats of Peter Jackson's Middle Earth films. First, there was the theatrical versions of the LOTR films on DVD, then came the extended versions on DVD. Next up, a repeat of the whole thing on Blu-ray, but they didn't mind because there was new bonus content. Of course the whole cycle repeated itself (omitting the DVD versions) with the Hobbit films. And Jackson had promised that, once all six films were completed, there would be an ultimate set released that would include even more new bonus content. Conventional wisdom would say that this is that set but, guess what? There is NO new bonus content included on these discs! So, essentially, the studio is asking fans to pay $800 for a wooden shelf and some swag. This is one of the worst, most insulting profit grabs from a studio in the long, sordid history of home video. This one is a HARD PASS at any price.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Middle-earth-Limited-Collectors-Blu-ray-DVD/product-reviews/B01JH3KL0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Essentially, the audience for this already have, as a massively lower cost, both the theatrical and extended Blu-ray sets of all 6 films in various configurations.

So while this is nice packaging, most would be paying $799.99, plus tax, for a shelf, 10 posters and a book of art.

Advice: Buy the Extended Edition Hobbit and Lord of the Rings sets, then but the individual or basic sets of the theatrical editions. You'll literally save around $500 based on suggested retail prices alone.

If this were priced around $150, I would have considered the upgrade.

Oh, and a fancy wooden shelf.

That's $133.33 a movie. None of the extended editions cost even half that when they released. Not to mention, only the three LotR movies are worth owning. So you're paying $266.66 a movie and getting three duds for the ride. You could buy all three major game consoles and have money left over.

If you didn't already have all of the extended editions, you could easily be very excited for this. Should you be 'entry-level used car' excited?

FOR THIS KIND OF VALUE $800 IS GIVING IT AWAY!","October 17, 2016","I think we can all agree that there are few things in life more satisfying than cracking open a Chinese manufactured, collectors edition box of... whatever. But many of you are questioning that hefty $800 price tag and asking yourself, ""is it really worth giving up a few months of food to enjoy Peter Jackson's opus in yet another collector's edition form?"" To this I can emphatically say ""YES"".

Allow me to point out just a few of this new box set's priceless features.

""crafted from solid wood with design selected by Peter Jackson.""

Not only is the wood ""solid"" but the design was selected by Peter Jackson himself! When I cradle this box set in my arms at night and sniff the ""solid"" wood as I fall to sleep, I like to imagine that Pete also selected each individual piece of ""solid"" wood himself, then whittled each piece of ""solid"" wood with an elvish blade that he smithed himself. Now I can't put a price on that kind of sweet dream fodder.

""the collection also includes all previously released bonus content""

Now you can get ""all previously released bonus content"" in one box instead of two! Admit it, that's convenience you ordinarily couldn't buy... until now! Before if you wanted to watch ""all the previously released bonus content"" you would have to open your LOTR box set AND your Hobbit trilogy box set. That's two damn boxes of ""previously released bonus content""! By putting ""all previously released bonus content"" in a single ""solid"" wood box, it cuts your box opening time practically in half! That's some amazing time saving value. Thanks Warner Bros!

""Exclusive premiums designed for the collection include: Spectacular 100-page sketch-style book with replica The Red Book of Westmarch, filled with original film sketches and new artwork, Original reproductions of exquisite watercolor paintings by acclaimed conceptual artists Alan Lee and John Howe, framable and wall-ready""

Exclusive premiums! We all love exclusive premiums! And for $800 bucks I can guarantee that these are the most exclusive of all the premiums! 100 pages of incomplete doodles! And a red book filled with more doodles! And color photocopies of someone else's paintings that you can frame... and hang on a wall... if you want. Now I know what you're asking, ""Just how big are these ""framable and wall ready"" photocopies?"" Well all I have to say is that for $800 they're big enough. May I remind you that these photocopies are also ""exquisite"" and you don't want something so ""exquisite"" to be too big... that's just too much ""exquisite"".

So in conclusion. Don't save your money. Buy this IMMEDIATELY. its only 800 bucks and Ramen noodles are super cheap!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Middle-earth-Limited-Collectors-Blu-ray-DVD/product-reviews/B01JH3KL0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Even if you were to justify spending $800 on this collection, not to include the theatrical versions and all the other bonus content that has been created over the years is ridiculous. Then to call it the ultimate collection and to exclude certain things insane and straight up greedy. I have had issues with them releasing theatrical versions and then later releasing extended versions but out of curiosity I still bought them because I'm a fan.  And I have enjoyed both versions, this is Lord Of The Rings that I'm speaking of, mind you. I've only seen at the theatrical version of the Hobbit, so I can make a judgment call on the extended version of that one. But if you're going to place nearly $1000 on a price tag even if it's just for the first few months of it's release you should not exclude a single scraps of material that has anything to do with the franchise that's my opinion. And on top of that for them to release all six theatrical movies on Blu-ray as a separate collection is just dumbfounding. Just enjoy what you already collected and if you haven't collected anything purchased them as individual collections instead of wasting your money on something like this, because it's a rip off.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Middle-earth-Limited-Collectors-Blu-ray-DVD/product-reviews/B01JH3KL0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, I was looking forward to someday be able to buy a complete edition with all movies in their extended versions in a one time purchase. When I found this offer I thought I finally could buy it, but the price (initially 800$) and all the negative reviews threw me back, and this is why:

1° This so called limited edition seems to be incomplete (it lacks material of previous releases) and it doesn't even have new ""promised"" content. I am pretty sure the content everyone is speaking about is already finished or it wouldn't be a problem to do so, and that Warner Brothers just sits on it for future releases. Therefore it is just a reselling of previous available things.

2° It is unfitting for people who look just for the movies. I, personally, appreciate bonus content but I am more interested in having just the movies in their extended version. I don't need any out-takes or commentaries but to my knowledge there aren't any editions of all movies together without it. This edition is too expensive for people like me and at the same time it's unsatisfying for people who look for the things described in 1°.

3° The price reduction form 800 to 499$ shows that Warner Brothers knows they messed up, and still it seems they try to earn the most of it.

In conclusion: Do not buy this.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Middle-earth-Limited-Collectors-Blu-ray-DVD/product-reviews/B01JH3KL0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you've been following the genesis of these movies, as I have, you'll know that there are still tons of deleted scenes from the LOTR trilogy yet to be released. They have also been planning, from the beginning, to create new documentaries with stories we haven't yet heard.

So why won't you see any of that content - as planned from the beginning - in this set? Warner Home Video apparently decided they didn't want to spend any money on creating these new features. And then they have the gall to set the MSRP at a whopping $800 for recycled discs that most of us have already purchased (some multiple times). In fact, it's even missing discs from previous releases! You don't get the movie discs from the theatrical releases and you don't get any of the 3D discs from The Hobbit movies...so it's not even complete.

Even if you have the money to spend more than $133 per movie, you should skip this. WHV has given the middle finger to fans everywhere and should not be rewarded for doing so. The home video market isn't what it once was, but Warner apparently wants to drive it into the ground. I have no doubt they'll be successful in their venture if they keep this up.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

So is ""extortion"", which is what you get when you buy this gorgeous boxed set.

Congrats on not getting your money's worth.

The price point of this wonderful product unfortunately makes it incomplete. The cost should include:

- All six extended edition films in 4k with all special features and hand signed by the cast.
- Diamond encrusted box sets.
- 24k plated gold wooden collectors box made from a tree from the set of Lothlorien.
- An all expenses paid trip to New Zealand, where filming took place.
- A weekend at Peter Jackson's estate and a personalized thank you for purchasing the set via a massage, steak dinner, and top shelf cocktails.
- A working replica of the One Ring of Power.

Throw in these extras, and the price becomes very reasonable. Anything less would and should make you the laughing stock of the Middle Earth fan base for being ripped off.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Middle-earth-Limited-Collectors-Blu-ray-DVD/product-reviews/B01JH3KL0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've been patiently waiting for the release the Peter Jackson has mentioned on several occasions, with never released deleted scenes and bloopers. I would've happily paid a reasonable amount for that release.

The fact that this release 1) doesn't have those previously discussed bonuses, and 2) boasts this staggeringly asinine price point, is an insult to the fans who have followed these films lovingly from the very beginning.

Here's hoping the eventual 25th anniversary set will actually take the fans into consideration and not be such an obvious, disgusting cash grab.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Middle-earth-Limited-Collectors-Blu-ray-DVD/product-reviews/B01JH3KL0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"
