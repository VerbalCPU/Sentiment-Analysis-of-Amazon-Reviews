White","Great Grip; and Great for outdoor, and Great for 7-year old size","March 15, 2015","Great ball!  I got this for my 7 year old son who constantly is playing ball (every day, & almost seems like every hour).
The texture is rubbery, but not bouncy (like a playground rubber ball, such as for handball).  It has same great bounce as a leather ball.

This is the 28.5"" size, which is slightly bigger than his normal size, but smaller than the full size ball.

He handles it great.  I do too, being only 5' 6"" in height.  The ball holds air just great.

We use this outdoors, on a concrete driveway.  The surface grip is still holding up well, after about 100 hours of use.  The black lines are wearing out, but show me any ball that doesn't wear that part out while playing outdoors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wilson-Killer-Crossover-Basketball-Official/product-reviews/B00DF6YAIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Arrived inflated in the usual sturdy basketball product box. As usual, it had the aroma of rubber (imagine a new set of tires); if you have asthma or are sensitive to strong odors, you might want to have someone else open the packaging and place it outside for a few days.

Wilson's selling point on this ball is that ""super-wide channels increase player's grip and control."" I guess that is what spurred the name for this ball being 'Killer Crossover'.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wilson-Killer-Crossover-Basketball-Official/product-reviews/B00DF6YAIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_48?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=48&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was happy to see they had both colors available for their upcoming basketball season. They needed 27.5"" ball for their league. They options said they have 5 different colors available. I selected green and added to cart and then did the same for the blue. When we got it, we unboxed it and went to practice. Coach grabbed the blue one and said ""this is the wrong size."" So I looked at my order and verified. It showed green ball was 27.5 and blue 28.5. It's not right that I search for 27.5 inch ball and it shows 5 different colors but doesn't tell me each color is also different size. So now I wasted money, I have to order another ball and have a useless ball until they grow to that size. You guys need to correct that.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Edwards","Love Wilson","June 20, 2017","My son really loves this ball for two reasons.  One, he can palm this ball which he says is ""so cools"" and two he can easily pick this ball out when he takes his ball to camp or basketball practice - it's easy to spot in a sea of brown basketballs.

I bought this ball in the blue and white, the color combo is nice and we've have had no issues at all with this ball.  The ball doesn't deflate easily which I love and it handles wells. My son says that the grip of the ball is very good and it makes ball handling easier for drills and shooting.

This ball is great for indoors or outdoors.  I do like the Wilson brand, the ball is a surprisingly good quality and the value is exceptional.  I'd definitely buy this all again, I'm thinking about getting another color for my daughter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

($9 - 13)","January 13, 2016","[First of All Don't Pay More Than $13 For This Ball - It's Even $9 at Target/Walmart]
I've handled a few different kind of basketballs from leather to rubber and I'd rate this a decent - 6/10 basketball in general.
Rubber never was appealing to me due to it's texture, though with this one I wasn't particularly bothered by it, What DID bother me was how easily it picked up dirt/dust (like a magnet)

The play quality isn't too shabby, with it being a rubber ball the shell is rough and you'll find yourself with blisters and the eventual calluses on the tips of your fingers within the first week - I suppose as one should expect?

The grip is also very dependable and makes this an exceptional ball for practicing dunks over your younger brother. The wear on the ball soon becomes apparent after mild use, Mine has started to form bumps and buldges after 25+ hours of use looks more like a gray and white ball and I never leave it out.

This is a good throwaway outdoor ball. I take it out when I don't want my other ball damaged in the rain.

I don't expect it lasting me more then a couple months if it looks and feels like it does after only 2 weeks.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wilson-Killer-Crossover-Basketball-Official/product-reviews/B00DF6YAIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_39?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=39&reviewerType=all_reviews"
