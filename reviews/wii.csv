The system is not for hardcore gamers, who can spout poly-count statistics in their sleep. The Graphics are nowhere near the capabilities of the Xbox 360 (Which I own, and enjoy immensely) that being said graphics are far from everything. The game play and ability to pull non gamers into the mix makes the Wii well worth the purchase price. If you are a Gamer I would recommend the Wii as a secondary system that you pull out when friends or family want to enjoy some time together.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Graphics-They are much better than a lot of people give them credit before. They are not just right above the Gamecube or PS2, but just under that of the 360 and PS3. This is with the Standard Def cables on an HDTV.

Gameplay-The controller at first glance when I read about the system threw me as something that could be difficult and frustrating. After hooking it up and using them, I wonder how I ever managed without them. Easy to use and get a handle on, nothing complicated. You become a part of the game, finally. This controller makes the Wii a true NEXTGEN console.

Net connection-TBD (As Nintendo is currently working on these features, the 'Live' connection has a lot of potential to be just as good as XBOX Live and compete with the PS3 connection.) We'll see what Nintendo does with this feature over the up and coming year.

Price-No it doesn't have blueray, 1080p, or a compatiable HD drive, but it does have great gameplay, graphics that can compete with the 360/PS3 if need be, all for a fraction of the 360 and PS3. A true must buy, Nintendo has offically won me back after all these years away.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_202?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=202&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I ordered the Wii for a family present and the people playing it today range in age from 4 to 57  (4, 18, 19, 28, 35, and 57 actually played and loved it) and we all love it so far.  I got several of the games but the wii sports alone that came with it is just really fun.  I have no time to look up game codes and cheats and learn 102 game control combinations to win something but I can have fun with the wii simply because I can use a remote control.  It's just tight :-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_223?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=223&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Penland","Wiiness","July 24, 2008","Let me start off by saying that trying to get one of this things wasn't very easy. i looked for about 3 weeks for onr and I looked everywhere. I didn't realize how high this things were in demand.

Anyways I was amazed at how small and compact the system was. Its very sleek and pure white giving it the modern look. The only problem I had at first was the sensor bar. But that was because my living room is kind of small and I needed to stand further back. Moved a little and it was fine.

 Now it comes with wiisports which is one of the funest games for the wii. Which is cool and sad at the same time. There arn't many great games for the wii. The ones that are fun are cartoony and childish. And there isn't any news of any good titles coming out soon. But the saving grace would have to be super smash bros. Its very fun and you can have 3 of yours friends playing with you. Oh, and you can play with the gamecube controlers if you please.

So I would recommend the wii to families, children, or as a sweet little party machine. But for the adults or more serious gamers i would go for the 360 as it has the best selection of games out of all the systems( just make sure to get extended warrenty as I'm on xbox #4 and havn't even owned as a xbox for barely a year).","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_203?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=203&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Stevens","Fun for Adults and Children","June 6, 2008","Having a 3 and 6 year old I was looking for a gaming system that would have games they could play as well as ones that I would enjoy.

Although the major consoles all have games for children as well as adults, the Wii allowed a more physically active engagement. For this reason, and specifically the Wii Fit product, I decided to go with the Wii.

While I am very pleased with the Nintendo Wii and the games I have gotten so far, I have been a little disappointed with the graphics. I am not one that usually cares too much what the graphics look like as long as the game play is good, but I was expecting the games on the Wii to at least look considerably better than games on the GameCube. So far I have not found this to be the case. In most of the games I have played, the graphics were pretty similar to the GameCube or only slightly better.

Overall the Wii is a very fun system and great to have for a family, but don't expect the games to look that great, even compared to the prior GameCube system.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_188?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=188&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Kowalewski","Wii - one of Nintendo's best","November 27, 2006","The Wii is 250 fifty dollars, comes with a brand new controller dubbed the 'Wiimote', doesn't support HD-DVD/Blu-ray, HD, and has graphics of a lesser quality then it's competiters.

In my opinion though, the only thing that matters is the cheap price and the Wiimote.

We got this system on launch day along with Excite Truck and an extra controller.

All I can say is that it is simply amazing. The controller in Wii Sports is very pricese...it really feels like you're playing tennis/bowling/baseball!

It is very easy to use...within minutes I got both of my parents to play...now they're addicted! They're always challenging me or each other to a match on Wii Sports Tennis!

Excite Truck is quite a fine game too. You use the controller to steer like a while and it is a great experience.

The Wii Channels are superb. The Mii channel lets you create little 'avatars' of yourself to use in Wii Sports, the Photo Channel lets you interact with photos: we even put together a touching slideshow from one of our vacations!

The Wii Shop Channel is quite well, as you can download games from past Nintendo systems. I downloaded two and they both work perfectly.

There are also the Weather and News channels, which are coming in January. I hear they will be quite good.

But to top it off, Wii is truly an amazing system and my whole family loves it. It doesn't matter that it doesn't have the best graphics, the controller is great and just plain fun.

If you see one in a store, be sure to buy it, along with another controller!

Afterall, the Wii IS the best console Nintendo has ever made.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_217?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=217&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But I wanted to find something that would motivate me to be more active. The concept behind Wii was just what I needed.

I order the Wii and Wii Fit Plus with a Balance Board a few days ago, and both came within a matter of days. I will review Wii Fit Plus in another review, but I wanted to review the Wii and say how please I am with the game console. The Wii comes with some simple games that I would say do more to demo the console than to be serious games, but they are still fun (at least those that I played.

The hook up is simple: attach the power cord, audio video cable and the infrared ""sensor."" The remote is already synced with the console. (New remotes require an extra sync process, but it's not difficult.)

The only disappointment is that the games are not very costomizable. Tennis can be played with one to four real players, but playing with one real player still results in a doubles game with three automated players. It looks like the real player in this case always gets the ball to return, so it's a little like playing a singles game, but the automated partner still swings occasionally (and misses) and that is a little distracting.

It was still fun, however, and a good cardio workout.

The Wii will let you cheat, and some have given the console low marks for that account. For example instead of swinging with your arm while playing tennis, you can make gentle wrist snaps, and the Wii won't be the wiser. But this is just a game after all, and it requires a little imagination. Forget about the cheats, and play it right, and you will be a lot more active than you were when watching your favorite soap.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We have six games and the Wii Fit, but we use the system frequently and enjoy every minute of it.  (We just aren't the type of people to spend money on dozens of video games.)

We were very disappointed that when we opened it Christmas morning, the drive did not work and we could not use it.  Naturally, because it was Christmas, it took SEVERAL days to get through to Nintendo Customer Service.  The gentlemen I spoke to was very nice and expedited shipping for us.

I know a lot of hardcore gamers are sitting around scratching their heads, wondering how anyone in their right mind could pass up a masterpiece like Mass Effect or GTA4 and settle for games as simplistic Boom Blox or Wii Sports. Well, some of us get to a point where we either feel like games are getting way too complex, or we decide that playing video games for 4-5 hours a day is just not a healthy lifestyle choice and/or something we no longer have time for. In my case, it was a little bit of both.

The Wii has the kind of games that I can pick up and play for a couple of hours, put it down, then pick it back up a few weeks later and not have to try and remember how the controls work, or having to backtrack because I forgot the storyline. And I don't have to watch 3 hours of cut scenes in between levels either. It is perfect for when I occasionally just want to kill and hour or two on a Saturday afternoon, as most of the games don't require a huge time commitment to get into them. Contrast that with something like GTA4, where you literally have to play for hours just to be introduced to all the game mechanics. Why go through all that when I can just throw in Geometry Wars and start having fun immediately?

When I had my 360, the only retail game I was playing was Guitar Hero... the rest were XBLA titles. That is when I decided that the Wii was probably a better fit for me, and I have not been disappointed Sure, the graphics aren't all that impressive and the online capabilities aren't as good, but I can live with that.

A really big plus with the Wii is that I can get my non-gaming friends to play with me when they come over. They wouldn't go anywhere near the 360 controller, but the Wii is much more accessible in that regard.

I think the biggest thing I appreciate about the Wii though is how QUIET it is! The 360 sounds like a dying calf in a snowstorm when it's turned on; the only time I hear anything from my Wii is when a disc is spinning up. But even then, it's quieter than the 360 was when it was idling.

UPDATE: I have since re-purchased a 360 and sold my Wii, primarily because my TV died and I decided not to replace it, and I could hook the 360 to my PC monitor via the HDMI port. (The Wii has neither an HDMI port or a VGA adapter.) Plus Geometry Wars 2 was calling my name :)

But the other reason for this is because 95% of the 3rd party offerings for the Wii are crap, and Nintendo doesn't seem interested in catering to casual gamers over the age of 12. I'm not the kind of person who requires blood and gore to make me happy (in fact, I don't really like that sort of thing), but I got tired of playing games with furry characters and pastel colors. I'm not saying those are bad, but it just gets old after awhile.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_194?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=194&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Wii Parties Rock!","July 26, 2008","I'd never heard of a Wii Party before, but since we bought a Wii 4 months ago, We've hosted several. I initially got hooked on the Wii when I played Guitar Hero III for the first time last Christmas at a family get together. I spent the next few months trying to find one. After I did, I came to realize how much fun it really was. My kids (ages 3 and 6) have just as much fun as us big kids playing it. Even my 70 year old mom got in on the act - she and I play 9 holes of golf on it every once in awhile.

My last video game system was an early 90's Sega Genesis. I grew up playing video games, but haven't owned a system of my own since the 3D0 (anyone remember this one?). At any rate, VERY hard core gamers may not like the Wii, but it is perfect for those of us who like video games but cannot devote hours on end to playing them.

Fabulous fun for whole family","January 12, 2009","I am not much of a gamer & only play video games occasionally so never having owned any game console before, I went for the Wii because of it's physical activity based games.  I have only had it for about 10 days & I have to say I absolutely love it! It is so much fun to play especially with multiple players.  Before the Wii, whenever we had guests we'd sort of sit around watch TV but with the Wii, everyone gets engaged in playing it.  I especially enjoy the boxing & bowling among others - Tennis, Golf & baseball are quite a lot of fun as well.  I just bought the Wii fit for my wife & I am sure I'll end up using it as well - not a replacement for going to the gym but atleast you can work out at home & being that it is so interactive it's much more fun than using a piece of some dumb equipment.  So why 4 stars & not 5? Because, as in everything in life, there's always room for improvement & I feel that Wii has just scratched the surface of it's full potential.  To me, the Wii is the iPod of video games.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Wii is very well designed, and compact.  It's got some great features.  The remote is definitey innovative and games like bowling and tennis on Wii Sports is really fun, especially if you're with a group of friends.  Other features like the internet browser, weather channel, and ability to buy older games is cool too.

The biggest problem is that there aren't many games and the ones that are out aren't too diverse.  Most of the games appear to be aimed at younger gamers or party-style games.  I'm 30 so it's hard for me to get all excited about games like Happy Feet and Cooking Mama.  Also, yes I know innovation is a big part of fun, but why not at least TRY to push the graphic power of the Wii?  Most of the games look about Gamecube quality or Xbox quality.  I'm positive the Wii can push more in the graphic department if the developers tried.  In addition, I am not sure where Nintendo is going with the online gaming aspect.  I think that's going to be a HUGE part of next-gen gaming yet they seem to have no solid infrastructure for that.  I had tons of fun on my PS2 playing games like Socom online w/other people, which also in effect increased replay value.

I'm not writing this to bash the Wii.  I genuinely like what is is and the idea behind it.  I just wish that there were more games and more TYPES of games out.  The gamecube suffered from lack of software, and to be honest I feel the Wii is so far running the same track.  I just bought RE4 yesterday as that is the only game at the local store that looked fun for me.  I'm not sure I like having to wait another half year for the next killer app title for Wii. If you like shooters, RPGs, or action games, the Wii probably isn't the system for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_248?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=248&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Hook","Excellent, it should have been named 'Revolution'.","December 27, 2006","I just purchased this today from a local gamestore. I have to say that even though i was exposed to all the intense hype i am very impressed by the Wii. Other people have written huge reviews so i will just keep mine short.

- The size of the unit is pleasantly small. Its about the size of a desktop computer CD/ DVD drive. Its unobtrusive and doesn't fight for space with my DVD player or Satellite TV decoder.

- Its very quiet. Even when the disc drive is in use loading a game. There are no loud fans to cool the system.

- The Wii Remote is great! I don't know why nobody thought of this years ago. When you point at a button on the screen it Rumbles, sometimes it makes a sound. These little bits of feedback and the motion tracking function make control of a complicated computer in the living room possible and easy.

- The networking function is very good. Full WiFi security functions are supported.

- The Opera browser (now available via free download) is absolutely amazing. You can view pretty much any webpage on the Wii that you can view on your PC. Google video and Youtube work perfectly. You dont have to strain your eyes on text either because it includes a 'smart' zoom and scrolling function.

PS: One thing though...i really recommend you have a high speed internet connection along with a WiFi router to use the coolest features on the Wii (The Opera Browser and Wii shop).

PS2: Its fun!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_184?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=184&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It is a blast and you actually move more than your fingers!  The Wii Sports games that are included are especially fun when we have company over.  Everyone seems to love bowling.  I am personally addicted to tennis.  You can play 1 position or all 4, it is mind boggling.  We also just recently got Wii Resort and Wii Fit and they take the games to an even higher participation level.  Our whole family also had fun setting up our avitars (Miis).  Very clever.  I highly recommend this product for older folks like me (48 years old) weither you have kids or not.  Unlike other games, it can be a social tool vs. something that isolates you.  It is easy to set up and to use and you can play old GameCube games as well as the new motion activated ones.  Fun for the whole family and a bargain.  My only warning would be to gamers who like total realism, like my XBox addicted son.  The sports games have pretty simple cartoonish graphics.  They are a different kind of thing, not better, not worse, just very different.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But let me tell you, it was well worth the wait!  I got mine on the day after Christmas.  Setup was a breeze, and everyrhing worked right out of the box.  It took me a little while to get connected to my wireless network, but that was my fault (I was using the wrong password :O().

For any parents who are planning on purchasing this, let me give you some advice.  Wii Sports which comes with it will provide many hours of enjoyment.  In fact, I bought Rayman's Rabbits for the minigames, since my youngest (6) likes those alot.  In reality, in the four days we have had it, we have been playing only Wii Sports.  While none of the games is really indepth, they are easy to pick up and play.  We have probably had the most fun bowling.  Hats off to Nintendo for such a great included game, and showing the possibilities of the system.

I also purchased Zelda for myself, and already put in 4+ hours.  Having played all the Zelda's on the various systems, this one was a must have.  I am really enjoying it.

One other point - creating the Miis is a blast.  We spent about a half hour as a family creating all our Miis.  And it is cool how they show up in the various Wii Sports games, even if they are not actually the ones playing.

All in all, Nintendo has finally created a game system for the whole family.  No, it doesn't have cutting edge graphics, but it is a lot of fun to play.  Even my wife enjoys bowling, and she is definitely not a ""gamer"".  And what other system can make you sore the next morning (aka Boxing).

Get one for yourself as soon as you can.  You will not be disappointed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_217?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=217&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The design is quite straightforward offering ease of operation. The remotes have been designed to reduce slipping out from the hands and damaging the remote or other objects that may be neraby, such as the TV. This protection is increased as the players use the attachable wrist strap. The Wii is popular for its concept of helping to keep the body moving, working and buring the calories, while playing games. This has been a great selling feature. However, as a parent, I noticed that my kids will play the sports games while I am around, but resort to the fingers-only games when I am away. So, it will be unrealistic for consumers to think that the Nintendo Wii will magically solve their exercise problems. They will need the same amount of self-determination that they will need in going to the gym on a regular basis[Nwankama Nwankama]","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_188?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=188&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Yes, xbox or playStation may offer superior graphics or games, but they won't get you moving. It's this ""exercise aspect"" that would cause you to fell in love with this.

Here is another way to look at it. If the following does not sum it up, I don't know whatelse will.

My 4 and 6 year old daughters enjoy it, I (40) enjoy it and everybody else I know of enjoy it.

There have been jokes about how you look while you play it, jokes about accidentally throwing the controller, and jokes about everyone who owns one being a bit of a puss.

Next gen purists have sadly lost sight of what gaming was all about in the first place - fun.  The Nintendo Wii is anything but a joke, the controller makes it a sort of side-show attraction for non-gamers and a loveable oddity for avid gamers.  in addition, it is somewhat of a link to the past for those of us who grew up on the original NES.

The graphics aren't that much better than the Gamecube.  So what??  They're games.  What do you want them to look like?  Nintendo and gameplay have always gone hand in hand, no matter what the competition was doing.  There is no doubt of the fact that they left a lot of the polished graphics aspect behind in order to do something more important.

Although the controller is a bit of a reach for a lot of gamers, I found it a welcome change with most games that I played.  It is slightly physical, but who has time to make fun of you when there are games to play?

Nintendo has always been a company full of geniouses, but what they've done this time is beyond compare.  They took their main markets of loyal oldskool fans, children, and general fans of Nintendo platformers (esp. Zelda and Mario), and played to all of them.  They seem to have left out 18-24 year old males, the main demographic of the gaming industry, but it was apparent that they would not win that battle anyway.  In their place, they took up a whole new market, that of the non-gamer.  Games like Wii Sports enable you to hand a wiimote to any of your non-gaming friends and have them playing a game within a few minutes.

The Wii is an incredible system and it has not EVER given me any problems since I got it at launch.  Soon enough there will be a whole new batch of games coming out for it and it will become even better.

This system is highly reccomended for Nintendo purists, fans of oldskool gaming, people who want to get their kid a new system (but want to play the same system themselves), and really just for any gamer.  At least make it your second system.  You won't regret it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_177?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=177&reviewerType=all_reviews"

""I'll teach those bleedin' couch potatoes"", he said with a laugh.  ""Ho Ho Ho"", and off the old jelly belly flew, with his sleigh full of Wii related accoutrements for sedentary families around the world.

Having the good fortune to have a semi-geek in the house, the Wii thing was soon set up in the kid's bedroom, and after 5 hours I thought I should check on the adult kid and the little kid - just in case.

Santa had sadistically included an extra controller and nunchuk with the package, so added to the pair that comes with the set, a full scale 2 kid war was in progress, covering bragging rights for five included games - boxing (little kid leading), bowling (big kid ahead), baseball (no clear advantage - but then we don't play baseball here, because it's just not cricket), tennis (neither will see Wimbledon) and golf (Tiger's safe for now)

They had set up a Mii (avatar) for each member of the family (self included), and looking at the body shape they chose for me, I immediately remembered that I should make a New Year resolution to lose weight.

Soon enough a challenge was issued, and hours later I emerged as the household bowling champion, but threatening to sue for physical abuse for my boxing loss.  (I think they made it personal)

All these games have an aerobic and physical element, and if you don't get yer lazy azz in gear, nothing much happens.  Bowling for instance, requires you to swing the controller like you would a bowling ball (making sure that you secure it around your wrist first so you don't put a hole in your TV), and after hours of unaccustomed exercise, your muscles can really feel the burn.  And it's not only your arm muscles.  One does not bowl without the correct body language after all.

Oh the pain!!

Now they're looking at all the other doo-dads and wing-dings to further their Wii experience, and making strong birthday and father's day hints.  IMHO they should drop off their requests to the fat man in the red suit, and get HIM to come over and play some games.

Off to review some Icy Hot and Radian B, and make a massage appointment.

I just (finally!) got it today, and I'm going to go back to playing with it when I'm done here.

My one question here, and it's the reason it got 4 stars from me and not five...is ""what is Nintendo thinking??""

A revolutionary gaming console.  That has some neat games and the power of Mario/Zelda/etc behind it.  AND has the ability to connect you with all the favorites that you played as a kid.

And Nintendo makes barely any.  Did they think that it was going to flop?

I went to 10 stores across three states to get this thing.  When I finally got it, the salesperson wouldn't tell me how many he had, and fielded 5 phone calls in the 10 minutes I was there, asking if he had any.  One person in the store bought one just off of my excitement.  He didn't even plan on getting one.

Why, Nintendo, are you putting your salespeople and your gamers through this?  I heard that it was only going to get worse with the upcoming holiday season, because Wiis are going to virtually run out in some areas before Christmas.  Between Metroid and Mario Galaxy, this thing is going to be impossible to get in major cities.

Awesome console!  Great idea!  But your marketing team, specifically whoever so limited production, should be canned.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_192?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=192&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Henke","so much fun---but some reliability issues","October 9, 2007","I've had my Wii for a few weeks now and am having a blast.  Ordered from Amazon in one of those tiny windows where they actually had them in stock.  Also ordered Zelda, Wii Play, and some extra controllers.  Wii Sports is still my favorite---this game is a lot deeper than many give it credit for.  I have been playing a lot of tennis and have enjoyed increasing my rank against the CPU players.  The Wii remotes are incredible---they really respond to subtle movements, making a complex game like tennis seem so real.  My 5-year-old daughter has also enjoyed creating many Miis and has done well with bowling---even scoring a turkey in the tenth frame of her very first game (pure luck...I think).

With that said, I have also had some reliability issues with my Wii.  The first console gave me consistent disc read errors on all three of my games, so I called Nintendo about it.  After talking to/persuading a CSA to send me another console, I got a new one (it's actually refurbished I think---had a sticker on it that implied it wasn't new).  My second console has worked fine, except that I still get a lot of error messages when playing Wii Sports.  So now Nintendo is sending me another Wii Sports disc, and I'm hoping that will work better.  I will update my review when I test it.

In addition to these issues, I bought some Wii Points through the internet connection on my first console, and the CSA I spoke with the first time said that I would be able to transfer them to my replacement console.  Well, then another call to Nintendo after the replacement console arrived, and I am told that I can NOT transfer the points (worth $30) to the new console.  I end up having to speak to a supervisor, be put on hold many times, get a call back a few days later, etc---before they finally relented and put the points on my new console.  Bottom line: be really careful about buying stuff through your console, because if it dies, your stuff is lost (exception: games you have previously downloaded should be download-able again).

All in all, I love my Wii and have had mostly good experiences with Nintendo's customer service.  Good luck finding a Wii, and have fun.

EDIT (10/15/2007): My second Wii Sports disc seems to be working better---not getting the error messages on the second console now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_196?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=196&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'd never been a video game player growing up and I even sucked at playing games on early systems like Atari. I was afraid of pitting myself against other kids at video game arcades during my teenage...as everyone always beat me hollow! I watched my friends play the XBox and the PS2 a couple of years ago but never felt confident enough to pick up the controller. Then came the Wii in 2006 and it changed my definition of a video game console.

Wii is truly innovative as it allowed people like me to play video games for the first time. Wii Sports - the game that comes with the console -makes great use of the wireless remote. All of a sudden, I can golf or box or bat away in my living room. It simulates the game really well and you feel like you're really playing the game. Of course, it's not really the same thing as playing outdoors but then how many times do I get the chance to play the real game anyway! It's really fun to play the games available for the Wii with friends and family, and share some great times together. Wii seems to have the best collection of family friendly games.

With games like Wii Fit, Dance Dance Revolution, Hannah Montana World Tour, Jillian's 30 day shred the Wii has become a great way to exercise. With games like Guitar Hero and Wii Music we can rock out. With Wii Sports, Wii Play, Wii Ski, Mario Kart we can simulate some fun sports right in our living room. And of course, there are Zelda and Metroid Prime type games available if you're into ""real"" gaming.

I see XBox and PS3 more as the hard core gamer consoles, especially given the choice of games available for them. On the other hand, Wii really shines as a family console which can be played by ages 5 to 99. It seems like the best console for a night with family and friends, even people like me who still suck at the hard core video games can have fun with this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Rather than sitting on your butt you are able to stand and get into the action of the games.

One can only take graphics so far which is what Xbox and Sony are trying to do. They recycle the same games with a few more fps and that gets old after a while. The Wii is amazing and actually requires one to get up off of their butts and play. It's the common cure for the ""couch potato"" gamer. Family board games will be replaced with the Wii as the entire family can play this and have fun without doing too much strategy play like other consoles.

The awesome Wii ofcourse! This console is top-notch and this review will tell you ALL you need to know!

The Nintendo Wii has motion sensing technology, which allows you to move the wireless Wii Remote, and everything you do with the Wii Remote goes on the television screen, with the sensor bar that goes under or above your tv, movements will immediatly be recorded and performed on the television screen!

The features on the Wii are as follows:

Mii: The Mii feature gets all the fans of Nintendo brand systems back in the stores again, and this time not only because the motion sensing technology, but the Mii World feature. The Mii feature allows you to create your very own, cartoonish character. This character can be used on Wii Sports and Wii Play, and can be of you, family, or friends!

Photo Channel: Photo Channel allows you to load on any photos from your digital camera, or cell phone by an insert located by the disc slot and power button on the front plate of the Wii console. With this you can color on your pictures and make them funny, and you can put pre-made items on your photos!

News Channel: News Channel allows you to catch up on all the news from your Wii console. By setting up connections, you can learn everything straight from your Game Room with the new Nintendo Wii Console.

Internet: The internet connection on here is not wireless, you must have an internet connection in the room you have set up the Wii, this allows you to surf the web and do anything on the internet with the right settings, so you can go on the net without going to your computer, or laptop!

GameCube Connection: You can even store GameCube memory cards, play GameCube games, and plug in your GameCube contollers on your Wii Console! Now this feature is cool too!

Review: Now this console is brand new, just came out the November of 2006! So order your console right now! Because this console rocks!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_218?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=218&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The gameplay is unique and fun. It is smartly priced. This console really gets you off your couch and move around to interact. The game selection is good.

Eckenrod","Who needs PS3?","April 16, 2007","Two words too describe the Wii:  Fun and versatile!  Obviously, this console is not about the graphics, but about the revolutionary game play and I must say, it works for us!  I've been through a dozen consoles during my lifetime (I still remember playing the real old school ""Breakout"" back in the day), Ataris, Colecovisions, Nintendos, Playstations, etc...and in terms of just plain old fun, the Wii really outpaces them all because it really is a family-oriented unit.

Needless to say, I really put myself through the paces prior to buying this simply becasue I wasn't too sure what the next gaming step for our family would be.  We own a PS2 and I've been loyal to the Sony brand since the days of the PS1, but honestly, putting out $600 for a new gaming system seemed, well....just outrageous to me.  Enter the Wii.  Moderately priced at $250 (assuming you can get one at retail), it delivers a punch for the price.  Not only are the Wii games fun and interactive (our whole family plays now), but I love the Virtual Console aspect of it as well which allows me to go ""retro"" now and again and play some of my favs from the day.  Just recently, we purchased Super Marios Brothers for the old NES and I'm hooked all over again!!

The Wii sports game that comes with the console is a great introduction to the Wiimote and addictive to play.  I never thought I'd have myself an in-house bowling league, but my wife and daughters play just about every night.  Obviously, Wii sports is only an sampling of what you can do with the system and I can't wait to get into some of the other games available, but we are hooked.

Even if I could stop the review there, it would be enough...but add in the wi-fi capabilities of this unit and its future potential to connect with the DS games, and I have an all around entertainment unit for our household.

In short, we love it and I am extremely happy with our purchase!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_200?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=200&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The game play is both very fun and very physical... so physical that I would recommend stretching before playing. I'm 26 years old, and I thought my physical health was good. Not true, according to a fitness training feature in Wii Sports. After going through a round of physically strenuous challenges, I found out I have a fitness age of 71. That is both sad and hilarious. Fortunately, Wii Sports is going to work with me on lowering my fitness age, but I may not show up for the appointment. If you want to find out your fitness age this way, I recommended stretching because I didn't stretch before fitness training, and as of right now, I'm sore... too sore even for a round of Wii bowling or golf.

The controls don't take too long to get used to, and motion detection is... well, any way you move it, works (so to speak): Up-down, left-right, thrusting, twisting, swinging, thrust between legs, etc. I say ""so to speak,"" because the controls didn't work quite as flawlessly I expected. At times, getting my character to recognize a swing was a little choppy, i.e.: the character swung the baseball bat and golf club as I was pulling the controller back in preparation to swing. NOTE: I have not yet done any troubleshooting, and the problem was minor.

The system as a whole (so far) is great. It really is a lot of fun. Only time will tell if the novelty will ware off. Meanwhile, I already feel like I got my money's worth. Other family members, who face hurdles in the hand-eye coordination department, were hooked immediately and even beat my record in bowling. The controls may take some getting used to, and may not be the best fit for every game (or perhaps not put to their best use in every game), but they really change the gaming experience for the better.

Having said that, I was a little disappointed in using the remote as a sword when playing Zelda. Don't get me wrong, it's much more fun than button-smashing, and I like the fact that my wife and I can control Link in tandem (she uses the nunchuk, as I use the wii-mote). What I was disappointed in was the fact that the direction I swing the controller is not directly translated in the game -- one of the perks I thought I was getting with the Wii. Yes, moving the controller does affect control of the sword and other medieval weaponry, but only certain gestures affect the type of sword movement in-game. You can't just stab with the wii-mote to stab in-game, you have to target-lock and thrust forward while pressing A. So, no manual controls for making custom combos. With credentials such as a yellow-tip in Hapkido issued by the Park District back in '85, plus a fitness age of 71... it's probably for the best.

Regardless of my issues with some aspects of the controls, I think the folks at Nintendo are geniuses, and they have definitely struck gold. I'm sure it is nothing like the PS3 or 360, and I don't want it to be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_185?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=185&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It looked so different and so fun that we decided to give it a shot.

My wife does not play video games, she knows I like them, but has very poor hand-eye coordination and is horrible at video games.  That being said, she has had a blast playing Wii sports and has spent a few hours playing Zelda.  She loves that you actually move to interact with the game.  She doesn't care about graphics or about HD capable, next generation or any of that stuff.  She cares aboutt having fun.  That is what the Wii is, FUN.

I love the system.  I play it too much, but it is so addicting.  Sure the controls are not pin point accurate, but you get used to it, and it really is fun.  The graphics are not crystal clear, but they are good enough.  I enjoy them greatly.

It really is a fun system.  I own PC games and sometimes would feel bad, because my wife had no interest in them.  Now she suggests we play the Wii.

Very fun","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_195?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=195&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I had already played the PS3 an Xbox 360 at EB games, the Wii is better then both of them. I love everything about it, the sleek style the motion sensitive controllers, the great game lineup, and the fact that you can buy old games from older systems such as the NES, I just can't stop playing it! If you buy one off Ebay for 600$ it is tottaly worth it, but don't buy it for that much. My suggestion is to wait until after Christmas when it is in lower demand and you can get it more easily. If by chance get one, get the games The Legand Of Zelda The Twilight Princess, Need For Speed Carbon, and Exite Truck.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_260?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=260&reviewerType=all_reviews"

There are 2 versions of the Nintendo Wii.  The original Wii is capable of playing Game Cube games.  The new one is not!!  The easiest way to tell the difference is the picture on the box.  If the picture shows the Wii standing upright on a stand, it is the original.  If the Wii is laying flat in the picture, it is the new Wii.
I ordered this item twice, which shows the original Wii, however I was shipped the new Wii both times.  Even in the product description, it states that it is backwards compatible.  Do not fall for this, because they will not be sending you the original Wii.  After speaking with several local retailers, I found out that the original Wii is no longer in production.
I begged Amazon to ship me the correct item, and despite their promises, they shipped the wrong item twice on two separate orders.
In the end, I purchased a used Wii at a local retailer for under $100.  I was very much against purchasing it used.  But, I did get what I wanted, I spent half of what I was prepared to spend on a new console, and the used item came with a 2 year warranty.
For serious gamers, this is really deceiving, because there are clear and substantial differences between the two Wii models.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_144?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=144&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Not only is it engaging for people who generally don't like video games, but it delivers the gameplay a seasoned gamer wants. With titles like Mario Strykers, Super Mario Galaxy, and Guitar Hero III Nintendo competes with all the other gaming systems currently ou-there. It's affordable, and amazing fun! The internet capabilities allow me to play with friends all over the world and it's easy to use. I recommend this gaming system for anyone in college! It's a social system that the whole room can enjoy! The backwards capabilities is really nice to because I'm on a budget and cannot afford all fthe new games (lucky for me my roommate works at gamestop) so it's great that I can buy cheap, used gamecube games!

Graphics are excellent, games are fun, and you can interact with people on the internet. You can play both wii and gamecube games and the Wii has several memory blocks, so you won't have to worry about a memory card for a while.It has some annoying, but fortunately not serious faults, however. The sensor bar is too delicate, so if you're playing a game or on the menu screen, and it does not respond correctly, you either have to restart the system or (usually)buy a new one. Because of the wii remote and and sensor bar, you should expect to spend a lot on batteries if you don't have have rechargable batteries or if your playing a game that requires the use of the wii remote and sensor bar. Overall, not as good as some nintendo systems, but it is definitily worth buying.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_193?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=193&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm not crazy to stand out here all night freezing my self to the bone to get a Nintendo Wii for my son because I see this madness for what it is. Everyone else is standing here in a fog, so consumed with lust for this simple device, which next year at this time will be available everywhere and for probably at least a third less the cost. I tried to convince myself I was not crazy when the simple fact is that I am, and so is anyone who will take time out of our short lives to pursue such nonsense. Still there is something to be said for trivial pursuits. They help us clear our minds and decompress from the drudgery of our daily work which is no more important for most of us or the world than video games themselves.  Video games are a new creative form and a budding one at that. It will take time for them to mature to the level, say, films have. The interactive nature of video games open up many wonderful possibilities for the chance for true art to emerge. Since these games have been marketed for kids and childlike adults that si the direction the content has taken. As the creators evolve, as any true artist must, more mature and creative content will emerge.

The Nintendo wii seems to be the first system which shows some promise of raising video games out of the repetitive maze like shooting slump that has plagued them almost from the start. So far the games that I see available for the Wii are no better than their predecessors but once you play almost any game that requires you to flail your arms to accomplish your goals it is easy to see how this system may be instrumental in taking the couch potato stigma away from video games. I can already imagine games where controllers are on arms and legs and full appendage movement forces the user to actually get up and move. The content of the games themselves must evolve and I feel the content will mature now that the concept behind this system has.

The Nintendo Wii may lack 1080p or i and it many not have a large hard drive, or one at all. I am still unclear on the built in memory of this system and it's controller. It may have a poorly designed strap. It may also have an unruly army of witchy moms who would kill you to get their hands on one and a bunch of know it all gamer clerks that are savoring these last few weeks before no one cares to speak to them about anything. All these problems are temporary. The wii will evolve like the game boy did and before long all your hearts desires will be included in the system. I can imagine a USB hard drive, a helmet controller, boxing glove controllers for a real Raging Bull or Rocky game. I can also foresee a real story where the user is thrown into a world where guns and destruction are not the driving conflicts of the story.

The wii is a success if only for it's groundbreaking interactive controllers. true the PS2 tried this with the eye toy but it was clearly before it's time like the Apple Newton to the Palm. My 6 year old son took to this system a few minutes after I hooked it up. He knows nothing about wide screen or pan and scan, 480p or 1080i. He is just a kid but his immediate grasp of the nature of this system speaks  volumes to it's strengths and potential.

The Wii is here and will change gaming as we know it from now forward. All other future systems will follow their lead or be left behind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_197?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=197&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Gajramsingh","The Wii","June 14, 2007","I was one of the people that waited for this since launch day, but I missed out, I tried the Wii Tracker thing and still had no success, I eventually got it through one of the third party sellers on Amazon and I could not have been happier. The thing is my parents seem to be more excited about the Wii than I am. I don't have all four Wii-motes yet but I am certain when I do, I might not get to play, with everyone trying to get a game of Wii Sports in or even Mario Party 8. Don't be fooled by reviews that say `...Wii is boring, lame etc.' that is being said by people that are playing solo on the Wii. With two or all four players playing Mario Party or Wii sports the fun factor is unparalleled.

So what if it doesn't have online gaming (somewhat) and DVD playback, The Nintendo Wii is doing exactly what it was built and designed to do, `attract non-gamers' to the Wii. My brother in law who is a sold out PC gamer loves messing around on the Wii and actually wants to buy his own Wii-mote. If the Wii can do this to non-gamers and PC gamers then the Wii should find itself winning the latest console war, because there are more non-gamers in the World than they are actual gamers and Nintendo targeting this group will be what fuels their success. So to all those that sold their soul to the PS3 and the XBOX 360 (both of which I own) whether you like it or not the Wii is going to go down in history as truly being a `revolution' in gaming","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_201?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=201&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Also is the most entertaining of them all. Graphics might not be High Definition, but it looks very close to the XBOX 360 and PS3 when not running in HD mode. And definitively better than the original XBOX and PS2.

The game controls are simply unbelievable. Playing Wii Sports (came bundled) for example including (tennis, bowling, baseball, boxing and golf) with the Wiimote is incredible. It is like you actually playing in the game. You need to perform the actions by yourself. I have other games like The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess with awesome graphics, music, and you have to fight using your sword using the Wiimote. No other console gives you this kind of experience.

The console is a solid one and it works nicely and fast. The WiiConnect24 lets you connect to the Internet for playing, shopping, internet browsing (with the Opera browser,. need to be downloaded, watch news or the weather forecast, also you can view pictures using any SD card).

Simply an awesome entertainment center.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_192?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=192&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It has some great games, if only a handful. If you can get this a bargain price, get it. You will enjoy the classic nintendo games. Nintendo is the best in the busness at first party games. Sadly they are generally the worst at third party games. Crappy budget titles bleed from the library. It is a great system for family fun too. Wii bowling is one of the best games period. It's also a very reliable system too. Unlike the 360...
In my opinion, if you want to get a new system, go with PS3 or Xbox 360.
Mine collects dust. I turn it on once in a while to play bowling with my daughter or play mario galaxy, mario cart, last story, or rabidds go home. Those rabbits are a riot.

Young","Most Fun I've Had","January 30, 2008","I'm what most people the ""Old School"" gamer. I had the Atari, NES, SNES, Gameboy, Gamegear, Sega, N64, Playstations, X-Box... and on and on. I have to say that out of all the game systems I've played in the almost 20 years of gaming, this has been BY FAR the most entertaining system I've gotten to own yet.

I look at Playstation and even the 360 as cookie cutter systems. They follow a mold and then just try to outbeat one another with better sound and graphics. The Wii, like it's older brother the N64, completely revolutionize gaming.

You have a system here that completely reacts to your own movements. Take for example, the boxing game in the Wii Sports included disc. You can throw a hail of punches as fast as you want, and they still register on screen. You can twist, lean, and move just by mimicking it with the remote.

It's as close as you can get to Virtual Reality without strapping on a headset. I'd bet that we'll even see a Wii headset one of these days too.

But, if anyone is thinking about getting one of these systems... I HIGHLY recommend it. It has the sounds, graphics, and interaction that consoles demand. But, at the same time, it goes above and beyond every other system out there. Not to mention that you even get a little workout in the process.

My only suggestion to someone buying this system is to wait and pick this up online or via a retail store AT retail price. Don't buy into the hype and spend hundreds on this system when the retail is $249.99. I have been waiting for one of these systems for a long time (since release), and I hit up a retail store today to see about ordering one for later pickup... only to see 5 of them sitting on the shelf.

It may take some time to get one of these systems... but it's sure worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_178?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=178&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Chen","An excellent game machine for kids or non-gamers.","July 18, 2007","I was one of the lucky ones to get the Wii console during a regular Sunday hour in a Toys R us store.  I myself am a non-gamer although I enjoy playing games when I get a chance.  However, the purchase certainly benefits my sons.  My 6 and 8 year olds love it.  Also, 6 or more families in our residence area have regular weekend family meetings.  Each time they gather in our house, the kids (10 of them) will line-up for the Wii Sport games.  I will need to do a full time arrangement to ensure they play in turns.  I soon got another remote and they do have to wait for long.  Since they come to our place every 5-6 weeks, they have not got tired of playing it.

I am a serious audio/video enthusiast. The video quality cannot compete with the XBOX/PS3 I saw from the stores.  The difference is not 480P vs 1080P.  My Denon DVD 5900 delivers excellent result with 480P through component cable on my Panasonic 50"" Plasma. (HDMI may not give you better pictures, depends on what TV monitor and what DVD player you use!) The resolution in Wii games (Zelda as an example) is only up to gameboy screens.  The free sport games that came with Wii have draw-by-4-year-old type graphs. It is said that the newer games (like Pirates) have better resolution; the pictures are more real-like.  I haven't purchased those games and not sure about it.  But one thing I can be sure: many Wii games, including all old games from GameCube, are not designed even for 480P resolution!  The sounds from the games are good.  They would not embarrass my $5000 worth (not the full new retail price, but market price) Integra Research/Classe sound system.  But of course they are not to the level of finest CDs with good mixes.

All relatives and friends would pay deep interest in playing the Wii sport games when they first see it.  So this Wii can attract initial attention from most people.  However, I doubled if the same level of interest can last.  I myself also think that the PS3 or XBOX could be for more serious game players.  As a matter of fact, I just ordered a PS3.  I would conclude that this Wii is perfect for kids.

J","Great for the family!","September 3, 2008","The wii is a very good console for the family and young kids. I purchased my wii at Target the day it was released, and I was very surprised when I opened it up. It is a very small and quiet console. The console itself is probably the half the size of a notebook. It is also dead quiet, which is great, but sometimes I have check if the fans are still spinning, because it is too quiet! Wii also doesn't overheat, I left the it on for three weeks and it was still up and running and cool to touch.

The console does have gamecube backward compatibility, but does not support all the games. On the top of the console, there are two panels that open up to reveal four gamecube controller ports and two memory slots. Most of the games require a nunchuck so it is a good idea if you are planing to buy another controller. The console itself can have up to four wii motes.

In the front of the console are three buttons the: power, menu and eject button and under the flap is a sync button and a SD card for extra storage (wii only has 108 mb of storage). In the back of the console are two usb ports, fan, sensor bar port, power port, and av cable port. And yes the console does have a power brick and a sensor bar that is positioned on the tv. The power brick is smaller than the xbox 360's and is very light, so it can stored and hidden. In the box are: The Wii, the stand, intruction manuals, power cable, sensor bar and a/v cables.

If you are planning to buy this for a Hdtv, it is recommended that you buy a component cable(480p) for it, otherwise the picture will be very fuzzy. The graphics of this console aren't very amazing, but it really depends on what games you play, such as: mario cart, super smash bros. Brawl, and super mario galaxy. For almost every game on the console are interactive and requires you to get off the couch, the only game I know that does not use motion features is super smah bros brawl.

This console may not be suitable for heavy gamers, because it does not have a lot of fps which alot of people like (ps3 or xbox 360 might be suitable for them). This console is probably for people who want to lose weight or play a game with the family. If your planning to lose weight with this thing, then it's a good buy and your guaranteed to lose a couple of pounds or so. Otherwise this is a good buy especially right now as it is only a affordable [...].","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_195?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=195&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So I have had the Original Xbox since the year 2001. Had it for 7 years and my mom bought a Nintendo Wii.

I was like why mom Nintendo has kiddie games like Mario Party and Wii Sports! Which I must say those games are pretty fun to play.

Nowadays the Nintendo Wii is not just for kids anymore. With titles like Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and Call of Duty: Black Ops the Nintendo Wii has surpassed all expectations!

WHen it comes to graphics, the Wii is not the best. Except when it comes to Call of Duty 4,Call of Duty Black Ops, Zelda Twilight Princess. Its not the same as HD Consoles but its pretty darn good!

Wii Pros:

Cheapest System.
Additional Memory is Cheap (unlike Xbox 360 and PS3)
Free Online (unlike Xbox 360)
Wireless controllers (unlike Xbox 360 and PS3)
Motion sensor system (Xbox Kinect costs $$150 and so does PlayStation move)
No serious problems (no red light of death like Xbox360)
Both family and adult games
Talk to your team mates Online in Call of Duty: Black Ops with Wii Speak
Puts you inside the game: swing your arm = swing Link's sword, shake the nun chuck = reload your weapon in Call of Duty, turn the controller = turn the steering wheel of a car.
Can play Nintendo, Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, Gamecube games all on the Wii (additional controller may be required)

Wii Cons:

Graphics for many Wii games are not good. (research games first before buying)
May experience lag in Online games
No Blue-Ray
Easy to Hack (be weary of hackers in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare)

I have not had a serious problem with the Wii since we got it like 3-4 years ago. All games run fine, all controller work. All controllers are wireless.

As you can see from my review, the Wii has many more PROS than CONS.

If you don't have $500 for a new system and games, Nintendo Wii is the Best Option.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_191?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=191&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Have yet to try out the other games from the bundle but my friends played Marvel, Call of Duty, Madden, and Tony Hawk, and they seemed to them all.  IMO the graphics is not so bad.

NOW I AM!","January 14, 2009","I wasn't sure at first; I'd spoken to some friends who'd told me that the PS3 was a better gaming console, yadda-yadda.  And, in truth, if I were going to buy something solely for myself, maybe -- I said MAYBE -- the PS3 would be very cool because of incrementally better graphics.  And it would have been neat to have a blu-ray player as well.

All that having been said, however ... I'm blown away by the Wii.  Again.  Some of my friends have them, they like them, and I've enjoyed playing around with them at their houses.  But what really convinced me was that this device is SUCH a great thing for non-gamers and gamers alike because of the intuitive interface.  The Wiimote is a terrific invention, and even just out-of-the-box this is a fun adventure.  One of my friends told me a story of her 85-yr-old father Wii-boxing with her 7-yr-old daughter.  Now, I ask you ... is there ANY way that a PS3 could compare with that??

Final note ... I have bought a couple of ""gamer-type"" games for me to play with, and overall I've been pleasantly surprised by the following: 1, the Wii graphics definitely are good (though I'll concede that PS3/XBox are both probably better); and 2, the unique interface of the Wiimote to actually be able to swing a lightsaber or option-pitch a football make this a hands-down better experience than I would have had with the PS3/Xbox.

Love it.  Get one ... you will, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_186?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=186&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm quite satisfied with the workouts offered by the WII FIT system,  and it's pretty easy for me to stay interested in daily excersize.  My only complaint is that there is much more empahsis on snappy movement,  as opposed to good form.
As for gaming, I purchased Call of Duty Reflex and the Zapper remote holder. As expected it took me a day or so to get up to speed with the aiming, movement, an such, but once I got the hang of it,  it took me about 12 days of play (a couple of hrs at a time) to complete all missions in the game and open the Arcade Mode.  I greatly enjoyed the game,  with the only complaint being the graphics quality, (but I didn't expect great graphics from the WII)
Overall I gave the system 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

There isn't a console out there right now that can match this one in terms of player interaction. Sure the selection of games and graphics are two let downs, but let's face it, it's fun as heck to play some of these games. People of all ages from young to old can have fun racing with Mario cart, playing golf, boxing, or tennis. It also seems every month Nintendo comes out with a game that utilizes the Wii's unique interface to create a never before thought you could do that game.

When it comes to decide whether to choose a Ps3 or a 360, I would also say to include the Wii too.

Sounthonevichith","like nothing else","January 8, 2007","normally i wouldn't write a review but this system is soooo much fun i just had to write one. first off, i would like to state that i've been gaming for well over 30 years now so yes i know games and have owned or will own every system that has ever come out from coleco vision, atari 2600, every nintendo systems, every sega systems, ps1, ps2, and x-box. haven't gotten around to buying a x-box 360 yet, can't find a ps3, and can't find a wii. however, i have played all three of these systems because my friends have them. of the three i enjoy playing the wii the most simply because it's the most fun for me and my friends to simply sit down and play. it's easy to pick up and play without a huge learning curve. the wiimote makes gaming very intuitive and fun. i'm not a graphics whore so the wii's graphics capabilties are more than suffice. lets look at it this way, it gets killed by the 360 and ps3 but it's better than the x-box. for me, it's all about the gameplay and no matter how awesome the graphics are, if the gameplay can't match than the game itself suffers for it. now, i would like to get the wii first followed by the x-box 360 simply because it has all of the games i want. i will eventually cave and get a ps3 because i go wherever square-enix goes. now, i will admit that i'm a nintendo fanboy, but how can i not be if most of my favorite titles are from nintendo. here's a list of my favorite titles 1. zelda 2. final fantasy 3. mario 4. metroid 5. dragon warrior/quest 6. w.o.w. 7. virua fighter 8. valkyrie profile 9. vagrant story 10. destiny of an emperor. i still wish capcom would make a remake or a sequel to destiny of an emperor and unlike some, my final fantasy and dragon's quest gaming experience didn't start off with the # 7. well, hopefully i'll be able to land all three next gen consoles by the end of the year. i'm in no hurry to pick them up and i'm waiting for nintendo to release the lime colored wii. oh, as for blu-ray and hd dvd go, i'm not all that impressed by them. sure they look better than regular dvd but is it $600 to $1,000 or more better? i think not. i do have a sony trinitron 1080p tv with hdmi support so yes while i enjoy watching football in hi def, wouldn't watch it any other way, blu-ray and hd dvds are over-rated. although, i would have to say that it would be awesome if it were possible to pick up all of my favorite anime series on one blu-ray or two hd dvd discs instead of the 6-8 dvds. so, when i do pick up my next gen consoles it isn't going to be for the hd dvd or blu-ray it's going to be for the games. any hardcore gamer would pick up all three and play all the good games each system has to offer. as for which one i prefer, it would be the wii for the all important reason that it's easy to pick up and play with just about anyone whereas the other two you would actually have to have gaming friends. gaming really should be enjoyed by everyone instead of just those who know how to play them. i believe this is where nintendo has done the right thing. my whole family would be able to play with the wii whereas the ps3 and 360 it would be just my brothers, friends and i.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_178?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=178&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This decision originally raised some eyebrows but by the time the system made it's public debut at the E3 game show, jaws were dropping. The most unique feature of the Wii is it's new controller design. The controller has been split into two components, both of which are motion sensitive. This allows for some very immersive gameplay. Imagine being able to ""cast"" a fishing line by actually mimicing the motion of flicking a fishpole. Likewise, you can hit a golfball by gripping the controller as though it were a golf club and swinging it like the real thing. This feature really takes gaming to the next level and makes it a much more interactive and physical experience. So, what else can the little white box do? How does connecting to the internet sound? I was impressed by easily you can set up the Wii to connect to the internet, assuming you have a wireless network in your home. This allows you the ability to play games against other people all over the world as well as download classic Nintendo games from the older systems (NES, SNES, N64 and Sega Genesis games) which expands the versatility of the Wii and gives you access to literally hundreds of games. You can also surf the web, email, check the latest news or check your local weather. The Wii remains connected to the internet even when the system is ""off"". This allows the Wii to get new updates and retrieve email etc. It also allows your friends to ""ring"" your Wii to let you know they're online, ready to challenge you to a game. If you own the original Gamecube you'll be happy to know the Wii is backwards compatible and is capable of playing all your Gamecube games. It even has 4 slots for your original Gamecube controllers. Fianlly, as if all this isn't enough, the Wii can read SD cards from your digital camera. Just pop the card into the Wii and you can preview your photos on your TV. Bottom line, a great family system that will guarantee hours of family fun. If you're looking for the next step in game graphics, purchase an Xbox 360 or PS3, if you're looking for innovative gameplay and family friendly games, go for the Wii.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_183?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=183&reviewerType=all_reviews"

To elaborate: I go back as far as the Atari 2600, and my first home-owned system was a Colecovision.  Decades later, I got a Sega Genesis, and years after that I got a PC.  Around the year 2003, I got an Xbox system from my wife for Christmas (thanks honey!).

From the first time I plunked quarters into Quicksilver pinball or Space Wars (and eventually onto Defender/Stargate), I loved video games.  However, I always found the home units to be frustrating because the controls were never as intuitive/easy as an arcade machine.  I tried SNIN and the Atari Jaguar also.  PC games were where I stayed for a while because PC/RTS games inherently are a different form from arcade-style play; I could stay on a Defender/Stargate machine for hours on one quarter, but to play Starcraft or Warcraft for hours on end with a group of friends is a different (although enlivening) kind of rush.  Web comics like Penny Arcade used to `cover' the differences between PC/MAC gamers and console gamers to good effect, and reading such things lead me to believe that an Xbox would be a neat idea.

Unfortunately, no.  I had gotten rid of my Sega Genesis for the same reasons that I ultimately released my Xbox; the controllers were too frustrating.  Kids can say I just didn't put in the practice time, whereas I say, I already did - decades ago.  There just wasn't the same amount of fun as standing at an arcade machine and gripping palm-sized joysticks and punching quarter-sized buttons.  Yes, I could have bought the `arcade' board adapter for the Xbox, but I didn't want a rehash of games I had played.  I wanted new games with an easier way of playing them, and/or an innovative way of playing the current generation of home console games.

So my wife and I bought a Wii recently.  We played it for hours, laughing the entire time.  She was also a veteran of arcade halls, and we both agreed that playing Wii sports and Wii play was the most fun either of us had had with home console units.  The fact that Wii Sports can be played predominantly with only the remote helped.  Playing a leisure activity like bowling on a home console by actually moving your body  in  a similar manner to the real thing is a godsend!  Boxing (which requires the nunchuk) provides a great aerobic workout, along with tons of fun.  The other games are amusing, and don't forget to explore the Mii sections.

As for the `hard-core' gamers out there, by all means go get an Xbox 360; the graphics don't compare to the Wii, but that's not the point of the Wii.  It's been a long time since a home console could be handed around to different members of a family, but this console has the distinction of being the first mainstream console PARTY unit for adults.  Parents, grandparents, and their friends can gather around a Wii on a weekend with four controllers and have fun for hours.

I foresee a period when Sony and Microsoft change the way they design their systems and games due to the unforeseen explosion of popularity of the Wii.  As of this writing, it's been about five months since the Wii debuted in the States, and I had to wait in line in the cold rain here in Central Jersey for two hours before I could get a TICKET that allowed me to get a Wii.

My only misgiving is the Wii's physical longevity.  If my wife and I can squeeze five years of fun out of this console without a breakdown or trip to the manufacturer, this will have been money very well spent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_183?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=183&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Since we have paid our dues, we have the ""right"" to compare.

The biggest difference of the Wii compared to the PS3 and 360 is that it offers a substantially different approach to gaming. Because the controller is designed to be moved, swung, shaken, jerked (but not thrown at the TV) you need to stand up, move around and use your body. That's a far cry from letting your fingers do the gaming (like you do in a typical PS3 or 360 controller).

The PS3 and 360 are more powerful graphics machines. They are designed to take advantage of our new HDTVs and give us amazing graphics. You bet, they really do. Hence you pay a lot more for it. But, the Wii has proven that you really can have fun by allowing more interaction with the game's content, despite using the ""old"" (standard) definition TV. Critics will go on and on about how great the PS3 and 360 technology is but games are more about having FUN and less about having a romance with technology.

Furthermore, if you are a parent who's paying for your kid's gaming, then you might want to consider BALANCING the kind or themes of games your kid is playing. I have noticed that the PS3 and 360 games my kids buy are tilted towards getting their excitement up with shooting and explosions. With the Wii, the games are more of the jumping up and down, arm swinging, and body movement kind of fun.

This leads to my final observation. All the body movement required to play many (but not all) of the Wii games contribute a few points for anti-obesity. I'm shocked at the number of hours my kids could sit down to play games on their consoles, use their PCs, and watch TV when all I could do as a kid back in my time was to ride a bike or play ball.

250 bucks is not too much to pay for the fun the Wii provides. I hope Nintendo has got a lot of imagination up its sleeves because it take a lot  of it to make more games that can really use and benefit from the Wii controller and nunchucks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_193?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=193&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have almost all the major game systems including the Xbox 360, PS2, (played but don't own PS3) and I have hardly played the others. Why? If you want to be a thumb twitch couch potato, IMHO you are much better off with PC games.

The Wii finally gets you and your family off the couch. In fact many of the games the included Wii Sports and Rayman work you out so hard it is like an aerobic workout. 4 player Tennis is some of the most fun my family has had in a while. Forget the issues with the strap ... it is more likely that someone gets hit when 4 people are swinging and jumping around like crazy trying to win.

PROS:

- natural movements, ie, swing the remote like a tennis racket to play tennis

- detects quite accurately both your location and the speed and motion of the remote

- easy setup, connected to my WiFi for internet in minutes

- amazing slideshow and weather channel (make sure to zoom out to the globe ... you can spin the globe and check out weather all over the world)

- huge potential for expansion via download channels

- small, quiet and elegant unit

CONS:

- poor resolution compared to Xbox360 and PS3 (component cable does improve it)

- small selection of games at present- some are poorly rush ported from other platforms

- wireless remote can disconnect in the middle of a critical game when you move very fast, ie. smashing in tennis, (this seems to happen more often with certain batteries)

- wire between remote and nunchuck - nunchcuck should also be wireless

- if Sony or Microsoft have any brains, they will eventually come out with Wii type controllers, but they are probably 1 - 2 years behind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Reynolds","Wii are having a blast!","November 22, 2006","Instead of buying our system first, all I could find after Sunday was accessories at a few retailers. I picked up the accessories I knew that we would need, and then started asking everyone 'Do you have a Wii?', and 'When do you expect them?'. Only one local game store knew that they were expecting a handful in the next day and told me to come back then.

Before Wii, I had 3 remotes, 1 nunchuk, 3 gloves, $20 Wii points card, Wii softside shoulder sling (bag), Zelda, Avatar, and, Game accessory pack (extended base + glove + 512 MB). This cost about $400, but with a family of 4, I knew that we'd need the three extra remotes (color coded with the gloves for each member) to keep the peace in our home. The Zelda game is for my adventure seeking teenage son, and the Avatar game is for our pre-teen daughter.

Then the big day arrived - the Wii came home. I bought it along with the Zelda guidebook and MonkeyBall (after reading about how Monkey ball is a BUNCH of minigames ... we've barely scratched the surface with this one - this is a great party/family game).

After it was all said and done, I increased the GDP by about $750 for the entire system, 3 games, and accessories.

Now - was it worth it?

ABSOLUTELY. I'd score this 10 stars if that was possible!

I predict that the Wii is going to be this Christmas Season's ""Elmo"" ... but on steroids. Crowds may have been gentle, and considerate for the Wii when compared to the PS3, but I'll guarantee you this ... when your 'Johnny' gets a chance to play the Wii at his friend's home, he's going to be begging you for one - and I doubt crowds will be as cordial if a shortage of Wii's occur.

Our gamecube burned out this summer after 2+ years of loyal service. Our large gamecube game collection sat collecting dust, and the news about the Revolution/Wii hit the streets about the same time. We waited and waited for months, playing XBox and PS2 for a while - but no longer.

To say that the Wii is fun is an understatement. I don't think we've had this much fun 'at home' in a long time. It's so much fun, I had to sneak in a few minutes of bowling before running off to work this morning (while the kids were still sleeping).

Wii Sports - absolutely fun! We're big bowlers - and this was almost like playing at the real bowling alley - except my arm doesn't get sore heaving the ball down the alley. Otherwise, it senses how quickly you release and if you add a little bit of rotation, it will cause the ball to spin to the 'inside' (to the left if you are right handed ... and it doesn't seem to matter which way you rotate your hand).

For those that have frustrations that you need to vent on another family member, check out Boxing! I never thought I'd get into this, but it was alot of fun!

I can't comment on the other parts of Wii Sports yet - we've not tried them all yet! I'll fill in the blanks as time allows. For now, I'll have to let the kids play while I look forward to playing all weekend long (4-day Thanksgiving weekend)!

Warning:

Please - if you're reading this and you haven't figured this out yet - use the wrist straps provided with the Wii (and not the colorful ones that come with the gloves). You can cinch up the grey wrist straps. Wearing the wrist straps is MANDATORY, especially if you have anything that is valuable and fragile in the same area where you are playing. We haven't broken anything (yet), but there's already stories online about a player busting a laptop screen because they didn't use the wrist strap.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_177?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=177&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I camped outside the local Target on release night to purchase my Wii and would have done so even if Nintendo's revolutionary next-generation console were made of granite and had no moving parts.  Since I bought the Wii to exclusively play one game, namely Super Smash Brothers Brawl, I also make poor financial decisions.  This being said, however, (and ignoring whatever bias I might have against Microsoft and Sony) I highly recommend the Wii simply because it is the least of three evils.

Evil, The First:
I would really like to buy an X-Box 360.  It has by far the best game lineup (being out for nearly a year longer than its competitors), it has a very good online service, which can be used to download additional content for existing games and even new games, released only through ""Live"". The hardware (especially for the Elite version) is very impressive, on par with the PS3 and definitely better than whatever the Wii has to offer.  All of this being said, an X-Box 360 is very expensive.  The Elite version costs close to $500 dollars and, of course, most of the newly released games are $60 instead of $50.  Even this would not be a problem if it were not for the conspicuous hardware failures that numerous (I have actually seen the legendary RRoD with my own eyes!) 360s continue to suffer.  Paying $500 for a great gaming system is reasonable, but paying $500 for a pleasantly-shaped paperweight is a little pricey.  So the slightly less entertaining Wii costs half as much as a 360 (assuming you can actually find one being sold at retail price, like I had) and doesn't have any hardware trouble infamous enough to be widely documented.  Wii for the win!

Evil, The Second:
For many years (nearly six, to be exact) I owned a PS2.  With its unimpressive technical specs this console still managed to dominate in last generation's (that makes me seem so old) console war, simply because it had more exclusive good games than the Game Cube and the X-Box put together.  Sony seems to have learned the wrong lesson from the success of its previous console since it made the PS3 a technological powerhouse, complete with a Blu-Ray DVD player and backwards compatibility issues.  The latter wouldn't be a problem except that the PS3 has no good exclusives on it.  Yes, that's right.  Not a single game exclusively out for the PS3 is amazing enough to warrant the system's $400-$500 price tag.  If you don't believe me, go read some reviews.  The best of the best on the PS3 are all multi-platform releases, available also on the 360 (and sometimes on the PC).  Sure, there are promises of Final Fantasies and Metal Gear Solids, to be available sometime in the future, but, right now, the PS3 is just a DVD player.  By comparison, the Wii already enjoys a variety of exclusive first-party releases.  In fact, after being out for a little over a year, the Wii already has the standard Nintendo lineup: a Zelda game, a Metroid game and a Mario game (I'm steadfastly ignoring the Paper Mario game, Monkey Ball game as well as several others).  In about three weeks, the new Super Smash Brothers will come out, providing yet another reason to buy a Wii.  In addition to all of the new games, it is backwards compatible, so it can be used to play old GC games, as well as numerous ancient games, purchased through the Virtual Console.  If the PS3 ever gets Home working and if it ever gets its promised exclusives, then we can talk about technological superiority or HD resolution.

Evil, The Third:
I might have already mentioned the advantages the Nintendo Wii has over its competition.  The price, the games (though it does have a lot of shovelware, which I assume smart people won't buy), the backwards compatibility.  Add to this the nicely implemented motion sensor controller, the build-in Wi-Fi support and the vaguely Mac-like aesthetic appeal...and I suppose you get that the Wii is the top-selling console pretty much everywhere.

Recently, I have considered purchasing an additional gaming system (360 or PS3), but the aforementioned problems lead me to believe that a new computer would be a more sound investment.

It's a great way to exercise when it's snowy or rainy and you just can't bring yourself to go to the gym.  My 76-year-old mom started with bowling (with included sports package) since she is a lifelong bowler.  Then she took up baseball and she's been hitting more home runs than 47-year-old me!  The fitness test is fun to see where you rate in fitness every day.  I've found that I am not a bad golfer, although I think folks would cringe if I was actually out on the green.

Wii has also been great fun for my Big Brothers Big Sister ""Little"" and I to play together.  She is an awesome bowler for being only 10.

I just bought Boom Blox and I've been learning how to play it.  It's only throwing, so if you want an all-around aerobic fitness routine, definitely try the sports package (golf, baseball, tennis, boxing, bowling).

P.S. Making your avatar (Mii) character is also some of the silliest fun you'll ever have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_198?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=198&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Coonfield","Innovation and gaming at its finest!","December 19, 2006","The Wii has been released and it has represented to me the biggest revelation in gaming since I got my Nintendo Entertainment System back in 1986.  I've been an avid fan of the PS2, but with the new generation, Sony and Microsoft seemed to focus simply on making their consoles more powerful.  Better graphics, etc...

But with the Wii, Nintendo did something different.  They innovated and created a new way of gaming.  Something that differentiates from the previous generation in ways other than pixel counts and load times.

By now, everyone and their grandmother knows about the new motion sensitive controller.  As you wave your controller through 3d space, you guide your on screen self to swing a sword, roll a bowling ball, or suture a wound in surgery.  You quickly find yourself immersed in a new experience like no other.

The Wii package includes Wii Sports, a package of 5 small sports games built to show off the Wii capabilities.  Tennis, bowling, golf, boxing, and baseball are included, and while simple, these games will keep you and friends entertained for hours as you whale away with your new toy.

A great set of launch games quickly make use of the new controller style.  I personally recommend Zelda:Twilight Princess, Trauma Center, and Elebits.

If you are lucky enough to be able to find this system on the shelves, I highly recommend it.  As a video game player for the last 20 years, i can safely say that this is one of the shining examples for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_181?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=181&reviewerType=all_reviews"

At first we played Wii sports a lot.  But that quickly died down.  Then we had Mario Galaxy, Zelda TP, Mario Kart, Mario Party, SSBB, and Super Paper Mario.  We have since bought more games.  But the kids just seem to play a little and then go back to the 360 and PS3.  Banjo Kazooie, Rachet and Clank, and others.  They get bored so quickly with the Wii and i feel that is because the games, other than the select few that held their attention for a little while, are not that great.  That being said, the system does have a few must play titles and with New Super Mario Brothers Wii coming out it should get played a lot for a while.

The systems controls are great when implemented right.  I bought the Conduit and although the game was a little weak the controls were fantastic.

The graphics can be decent if a company chooses to do so.  Maybe not on par with other consoles but still really nice.

There are some games on WiiWare and of course they have plenty of classics you can download.

Although not included, if you buy or have a Wii i would recommend WiiMotion Plus as it makes for a more responsive motion control in games that utilize it.

This is a great system that would have been a 5-star for me if the games had been there.  Just needs more quality games.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_193?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=193&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Old and young alike were willing to game.  No longer were games designed that took immense skill or countless hours to play - now there were games that could be played in a matter of minutes and took very little skill besides following the motions suggested on the screen.

Now, however, the Wii is beginning to show its age.  It still only connects via 480i (or 480p if you buy the special cable), while the competion connects at 1080p (HD).  It has built in wifi, but only 802.11b/g - whereas newer standards exist (a/b/g/n), which allows better streaming, faster downloads, etc.  And finally, with the release of XBOX's and PS3's motion systems, the Wii has lost one of its major initial advantages.  Yes, it still has countless games that require very little skill or time to play - but XBOX and PS3 quickly ate away at that market as well.

What Wii still has that no other system can claim are the franchise games.  Mario being the most prominent that comes to mind.  Many gaming companies have tried to capture the appeal of the Mario franchise, but have found it a hard nut to crack.  Too many gamers grew up on the original Nintendo and Mario to care much about any newcomers to the jump, run, repeat genre.  With the addition of the Wii online store, users can buy old, classic games for very little cost, reliving some of their glory days of gaming.  Add the fact that the Wii now has YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, etc (albiet in 480i/p) and you have a nice combination for that TV in the gaming room that isn't connected to the PS3, Roku box or other network capable device.

Yes, the Wii has likely seen its heyday and isn't long for this world, but it will be fondly remembered as the gaming system that got people to standup and play!  That's something that will never be contested.  The Wii has attempted to rebrand itself (new colors, slightly new design and minor updates), but nothing will put it in the same league with the PS3/4 or XBOX / One.  Perhaps Wii is content with its lot in life.  Who needs to be number one when you can sit quietly, attract the casual gamer and reap rewards off game sales and other little transactions.

Overall, this is a fun gaming system, which I still own and will keep until it dies.  It doesn't get much use these days and isn't the most advanced piece of hardware in my home - but it still gets turned on from time to time, even if only to watch a quick Netflix film in the quiet part of the house.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Bayne","The best video game system","August 13, 2008","We have owned an Xbox, PS2, PS3, Dreamcast, various other Sega incarnations, and various Atari systems.  This is the most fun of all of them.  The visuals aren't as good as the PS3, but you get to stand up and move around.  The controls on all of the games I've played on the Wii are very intuitive.

We were lucky enough to get a Wii at Best Buy the day we decided to look for one.  There were none available online (at a reasonable price), otherwise we probably would have bought one from Amazon.

I think my favorite ""game"" is the Wii Fit.  We did have to wait for that, but it's worth it.  The Wii Play, which came with the unit, is still one of my favorites.  And I like House of the Dead.  Sometimes you just have to go out and kill zombies. :)  Oh, and Mario Kart is also a lot of fun.

What other game can people of all skill levels and ages play together and all have fun?  What other games don't leave you with sore thumbs?  OK, there might be some out there, but this is the best system.  You get your whole body involved and you feel like you've done something.

I had played my ps2 more than my xbox or my gamecube.  But I changed my mind and went for a wii.  I saw someone one amazon saying you could pre order it from f.y.e.  So I did and they called me to come get it a week before Christmas.  I had also pre ordered zelda.  When I first started playing zelda I didn't really get into it.  But now I'm stuck.  The way you have to play games on the wii is great.  It takes something old (video games) and adds something totally new in it's controls.  Also the online aspect is very easy to use and set up.  I think it took me all of 10 minutes to get online with it.  The store is set up very well.  Even if you normally have a hard time figuring things like it out, you will have no trouble here.  The colors of the menus are very nice.  Everything has a relaxed feeling.  You get to set up your own mii.  A mii is a little person you can create on the wii.  You can create as many as you'd like.  This may seem stupid but I assure you that is is not.  The size and weight of the system are all great.  When your moving it around you can do it with ease.  It has a very easy to open door on top that allows you to connect your gamecube controllers as well as your game cube memory cards.  It is so easy to get everything up and ready to play that you just feel perky when your through.  The only thing I would say annoys me is the wired controler bar.  Go on amazon or to ebgames and get the wireless sensor bar.  It is only 19.99 and it works great.  So in closing the wii may not have the highest graphics, HD support or online games but if you get one and play once you will find yourself saying.

To show you what to expect with the Wii I will talk about some of the main amazing features of the Wii

1. Fun family friendly games
The Wii is a great consul full of many fun games that are family friendly. One thing to expect with the Wii games is that none of them (that I have found) are rated above T (which stands for teens) and a majority of the games are rated E (which stands for everyone) so you can expect your child to have fun beating their games without having to worry about anything questionable occurring in them. The games are also great because a majority of them are multi-player which means you don’t have to worry about kids wanting a turn because they all play together. It’s also great when you have friends over because you can compete with them on the Wii.

2. Easy to use and it has a couple nifty tricks
The Wii is a really easy consul to use. To start off they tell you how it works. In addition, the main page of the Wii is made really simple which makes it easy to figure out what to click on. This is nice because on other consuls like the x-box I found it really confusing to figure out how to work things and find the right button to click. The Wii remotes are also really nice because they have a sensor system within the remote and all you have to do is point at the sensor. After hovering over the correct icon with your cursor you click on the picture that correlates with your desired designation. In my opinion I like being able to use a control stick to go to where I want to go, but the sensor is still easy to use, plus it enables you to play interactive movement games like, Just Dance. Now a couple little nifty features about the Wii include the fact that you can play your old game cube games on the Wii, (you still need a memory card) which is really nice because our game cube broke a few years ago but since we had the Wii we were still able to play good old game cube games. Also you can download really old games on the Wii by going to the Wii shop which is really cool, because it gives you the ability to try out some awesome classic games you probably can’t get these days,(you do need a game cube controller for those games however) so it gives you more game options if you’d like.

3. Transportation
As far as transportation is concerned, the Wii is fair, but it’s not the best. You have to unplug everything and wrap up all the wires and stick them in something, which is not hard, but can be a bit of a pain after a while. I’ve taken my Wii all over the place and have just accepted the routine, so it’s not bad at all.

4. Durability
Durability wise I think this consul does quite well, but I do not suggest dropping it or not handling it gently, because it can still break or be damaged. It also needs to be dusted frequently otherwise dust can get into the system and prevent you from playing some games (I have only had trouble with super smash brawl, because its disk is twice as thick as others). As for how long it lasts, I don’t really know. Mine has lasted for 10 years so far and is still running fine, so it can last for a long time if you treat it well, but I have had friends who have only had their Wii’s last for 2-4 years so I think it really comes down to how well you treat it.

5. What it comes with.
The Wii comes with a stand, a controller, a power cord that gives power to the Wii and another cord that makes it so sound and picture pop up, a sensor, a Wii remote, and a game called Wii sports. If you want to play with multiple people then you need to buy more controllers, because the consul only comes with one. (You only need four controllers total because that is the max amount of people).

6. It’s a bit dated now
Keep in mind that the Wii is an older consul and there are a lot of newer consuls that replace the Wii like the Wii U and the new Nintendo Switch. If you want something new then this is not your choice, but if you want years of fun for your child then this is a great consul that is fun and family friendly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_173?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=173&reviewerType=all_reviews"

One thing nintendo has never left out is the whole family.  This unit may not have all of the violent and top selling games at the other two units, but it has plenty of games that are fun, and allowable for 5-8 year olds to play with.  This is worth checking out.

I have owned Atari 2600, NES, PSP, PS2 & now the Xbox 360. I have also played several others in Gameboy, Gameboy Advance and the DS. I always had a soft corner for Nintendo but since I already own the 360 (which I love) I didnt really feel the need to go for the WII.
But the ever increasing sales and people from all ages raving about the WII made me go for it. Being so fond of video games I didnt want to miss the flavour of motion sensing. So got it last weekend. Here's my take on it.

1) Controls & Gameplay:
To start with its wrong to compare any other high def console (like the 360 or the PS3) with the Wii cos these are totally different products. The former ones are meant for hard core gamers who want nothing but spectacular graphics and detail. The WII is meant for people who either have not experienced video games and the ones who want good entertainment with simple interface and easy controls. (in 360 & ps3 some of the control combinations which are possible with so many buttons on the controller make it difficult to remember). And this is where Nintendo does a great job. It has the most easiest of controls in the games and chosing options on the interface and in between channels couldnt have been easier. It does not give you a cramped up feeling on the screen. Gameplay is very responsive and accurate mostly in all the games. Some people have experienced issues in bowling etc. where the ball turns towards the left. To counter all such issues, just make sure the Sensor is kept in the center of the TV and your controller is at the same level of the sensor while playing. This will give you best results. Also with the Wii Motion Plus getting launched the controls will become much better than they are now.

2)Graphics:
I own a samsung 40"" lcd and the 360 looks great on it. Since I knew the WII does not have High Def graphics I wasnt expecting much from it. But after I plugged it on, I was pleasantly surprised with the rich colours and the clarity of the games on WII sports. The distance between my TV and the couch is not more than 10 feet but the Wii graphics still look nicer and much more than acceptable. I was thinking of going for the WII component cable which I wont now. Dont think I require it.
So for folks who have a 29"" or a 32"" graphics would look neat with an AV cable.

3)Build:
Another thing which impressed me was the build quality of the controllers and the nunchuk. Its very intelligently done with smooth finish on top and slight grainy and frosted finish at the bottom. This gives a real good feel when you hold them for the first time. The console is pretty compact and can be carried anywhere.

4)Wi-fi:
This is a big plus as you dont need to hook up another lan cable or buy a wifi adaptor. It detected my connection in no time and I was online. Havent tried the online features but I downloaded one channel which was free and that seems pretty decent.

The only thing which I hope Nintendo changes is the supply of the worldwide adaptor. This comes with a 120v adaptor only for the US and cant be used anywhere in the world. Today all the gadgets come with a 100-240v power adaptor and can be used in any part of the world. This was the only problem which I have with this bundle.

Lastly 2 points:

1) Its a great extension for all the gamers on 360 & PS3. You should go for it and you wont regret it. It will be a good change from the hard core and online gaming which we are used to now days.

2) My wife who is not a gamer has also got hooked on to this and we have had great time playing tennis & bowling. We are going to carry it to our parents place when we go there next.

Overall, Nintendo has done a great job in getting people together with this product and anyone who is even slightly open to trying it should go for it. You wont regret it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_187?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=187&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We are tired of buying toys only to see them play with them for a week and then in the toy box they go to rarely be seen again. We have a 4 and 6 year old and decided to pull the trigger. And boy are we glad we did. THEY LOVE THIS GAME. They literally played it all day and didnt want to stop at bedtime. I love the fact that it makes them active while playing the games instead of just sitting there. The whole family will enjoy this for a long time. I highly recommend this over the PS3 and XBOX 360 for the kids. And there are a lot more kid oriented games for the Wii also.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews"

some Monkey Ball games

**SETUP**
watched a friend setup the Wii.  The process wasn't immediate, but seemed straightforward.  The included RF cable was used.  Strange Nintendo did not have the Wii S video cable available at all let alone include it in the box.  The sensor bar was rested horizontally onto the TV more or less center.  There was some physical setup with the wiimotes (attaching wrist straps, installing included 2 AA batteries, etc.).  There was some initial setup recognizing the console and 4 wiimotes (aka Wii remotes) that I wasn't around for, but it was done within minutes by the time I ducked back.  The wiimote is used as a pointing device similar to a mouse and the buttons like a keyboard for menu selection.  Popped in games and launched them from the menu.

**GAMES**
*Wii Sports....
A collection of 5 sports games to showcase the wiimotes' capabilities

Boxing -
It was hilarious to watch some Marine actually furiously punch the air as if he were punching a real person in front of him even though only moderately light movements were required.  Almost took out some furniture and the TV since he got sooo into it.  With the Nunchuck attachment also sensing movement in conjunction with the wiimote, you've literally got 2 fists.  Just before fighting, there's a warm up session/tutorial on how to punch high/low, block high/low, and dodge.

Tennis -
You don't have to worry about positioning and movement.  The AI will automatically do that for by running for it if it's close enough.  You just worry about swinging and hitting the ball with the correct strokes.  Actually, the game can be more forgiving than that.  I used a forehand stroke instead of a backhand stroke and the game swapped it for a forehand instead.  Sometimes the AI doesn't get to the ball on time for those slams or hard drives into the corners, but it would appear that happens mostly to you swinging the racket too soon and causing the player to not be able to dive for it.  There are some funny, comical movements as those Wii Tennis doll players try to ""fly"" towards the ball.  The moving around done by the AI makes this the least realistic towards the real deal, but I'm sure as a startup game, this was intentional.  I'm sure they'll be other Tennis games to address that.

Bowling -
Similar to real bowling, if not exactly like it.  Before you throw, you line up left/right position and angle of throw.  Whether or not it actually follows that imaginary line you drew in your mind depends on how you throw the ball.  Pressing and holding the underside button picks up the ball and releasing it while making the motion throws it onto the lane.  I'm barely a decent bowler, but it appears attributes like wrist movements and force of throw were accounted for

All the Wii Sports I've played were not quite the exact thing in real life, but then again, the Wii was never meant to be a substitute for the real deal.  Just a closer simulation of it.
The group of people who did play it were able to get into the game fairly easily after viewing the brief instructions whenever a new game is started

*Monkey Ball
A collection of 50 or so mini-games that use the wiimote extensively as well.  The mini-games can span minutes long to even 8+ minutes.

a game where u tilt the platform... (forgot what it's called)
An up-to-down scroller to guide the falling Monkey Ball character onto a target platform while collecting bananas for points.  Kinda like that Plinko game from Price Is Right.  You roll (like when an airplane barrel rolls, NOT to be confused with turns along it's long axis) the wiimote which also tilts horizontal platforms which was a neat way to control things.  It wasn't as enjoyable playing 4 player simultaneous since quarter screen display made it harder to anticipate and see what was below.

Monkey Darts...
Having played alot of real darts, this was quite realistic.  For example, just like in real darts some people who start off don't hit the board they don't throw with enough force so it goes down or they twist their wrist so left-right accuracy goes far left or right.  Using the A button (topside of wiimote) to grab a dart and releasing it to let go, u can get get more solid throws by throwing it with higher force (quicker arm movement).  The one game where higher speeds/force does make a difference.

All in all, the Wii may not be THAT, Revolutionary, but it sure as hell fun and different from the other 2 next gen consoles.  While I can't just strike off games like Gears of War or Geometry Wars as being inferior (despite being terrible at them), I will say only so many people could get into those types of games.  While Nintendo also has games that will appeal to a certain interest group/fanbase, truly any person regardless of video gaming skills and experience could get into these Wii party games.  No opportunity to review Wii's other features like the Virtual Console or multimedia capabilities of the Wii, but so far so good.  It's gaming with the wiimote are impressive and deliver.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_197?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=197&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Wii is a very fun, highly entertaining console that will keep you, your kids, you parents, your grandparents, the neighbors, and maybe your pets (just kissing) laughing and playing for hours.  Even with just Wii Sports, I have personally had tons of fun playing with friend seriously, and watching people make fools of themselves for fun.  Overall, its really never a dull moment with the Wii around.

However, this is not a console you want to buy if you are a hardcore gamer expecting to play hardcore games.  Honestly, I have a Wii to play with friends that aren't really into other games.  For instance, my girlfriend only played PS2 games with me about once a month, just because she was okay with them.  However, she is very into the Wii and will play for hours because she feels its simple and fun.  Me on the other hand, I play Wii, but I have another console for the ""real"" games...the Metal Gears, Final Fantasys, GTAs, etc.  So, if you or the recipient is into certain types of games, you may not want to get a Wii and look to PS3 or 360 as your primary console.  But, I will say the Wii makes a solid back-up console strictly for simple and fun gaming.

Overall, Wii offers a great experience for the casual gamer and their friends, but offers little to the true hardcore gamer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_207?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=207&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The GameCube never got on its feet and then the Wii comes out.  It feels like a gimmick that falls flat with the Wii-motes and many peripherals.

However, I admit that some games are fun and done well and it does continue the Nintendo tradition.

There are a few things that make the Wii worth buying more so than the XBox 360 or Playstation 3:

-Better value - $[...], comes with a game and a built-in ""memory card""
-Better controllers - The Wii remote and nunchuck are a bit pricey, but they are by far the most comfortable, accurate, and intuitive controllers I've ever used.
-Potential for on-line services - The virtual console games are a bit pricey right now, but the potential for Wii channels to grow into something awesome is definitely there.  The Wii is the first console I know of that shipped with a built-in set of on-line services, several of which were active the day of release

Now, for the review:
The Wii hardware is small, sleek, stylish, and attractive.  It doesn't feel cheap or flimsy, but compact and durable.

The operating system of the Wii is intuitive, clean, and moves pretty quickly.  The wireless configuration is easy for anyone familiar with wireless networking.  I had it connected to my secured wireless router in just a few minutes.

I can't say enough about how cool the Wii remote is as a controller.  Not only is it innovative, and provides whole new ways to think about controlling video games like Wii Sports, it's also a much more comfortable controller to use for traditional games like Zelda.  Being able to sit with your shoulders spread and your arms at your sides is a new freedom of movement that I never knew I needed while playing a video game.

Wii sports is also more fun than I expected.  Although the interface and games are simple, they are also entertaining.  The tennis and golf games borrow a bit of their look and feel from Mario Tennis and Mario Golf, both pretty solid ""fun-sports"" titles.  The bowling game is also particularly fun, especially when played with a friend.

Overall, I don't miss having the enhanced graphics of the PS3 or XBox 360 even a little bit.  The games I've played are fun and engaging, the new controller is going to change the world, and the on-line ""Wii Channels"" show a lot of promise.

I'm really happy I bought this system, and if Nintendo keeps delivering at this level of quality, I don't think I'm going to need any other game systems any time soon.

Wanna spend more time with someone, but can't get past awkward conversations? Wanna stream movies and TV shows to your TV, as you like? Turn on the wii, baby (& get Netflix)! From canoeing with family members, to swordfighting with friends, to cow-racing with acquaintances, to watching old episodes of Fraggle Rock, wii will have you laughing, rowing, slashing, lassoing (a la Indy!), and yes, now watching for as long as you can stand it! We've had our wii about six months, and it just got better! We just started our Netflix subscription a few weeks ago, and we love that too! With a Netflix subscription that includes the ability to stream, if you've got an internet connection to your house, you can watch any one of TONS of movies and TV shows (stuff you can't get on OnDemand!) My beau was especially excited about the 21 Jump Street Episodes :) Be prepared to spend more than just the purchase price for the wii - there are lots of fun extras that you kinda need, extra wii-motes and nun-chucks, in addition to the games (tip: always read the reviews on the games, I've bought a doozey or two, & if i had read the reviews here on amazon, I would have saved my $$ for a better game). But, if you have kids or you are even just a couple who goes out a lot, the wii (& now, netflix) may save you some money in the end, and you'll spend more time together, doing fun stuff. And after all, isn't that what life's all about?

Thanks to wii and netflix, we eat at home more (saves money, gas, & calories); watch fewer commercials (they're bad for the psyche AND the wallet!); are more active with our entertainment; spend more time with family & friends; spend less time aimlessly channel-surfing; enjoy more varieties of entertainment, like documentaries, old TV shows, and musician stuff; are more conservative with spending $7-15 per person to see a movie in the theatres (that we hopefully will enjoy!); and actually look forward to spending time at home (after all, we ARE paying for it, whether we're here or not!)

Gotta go, we've got a few movies in our queue, just waiting for our undivided attention!

PS - I rely on reviews here at Amazon to help me make informed buying choices. I hope this review has helped you in the same manner.

Living in Tokyo, you should now that space is very precious. So is your freetime after work (in general after 8-10 PM  or on the weekends). I live with my wive, a 3 year old daughter the 70+ year old mother in law, etc... So that already gives you a good background on what facts I had to make a decision on. 3 generations in one household, so how did the Wii hold up against it ? You are about to find out...

During this summer I was slowly collecting ideas for the next generation game console.

The choice to make was basically either

- an Xbox 360
- the Wii or
- the PSP 3

I wanted something that doesnt cost an arm and a leg and doesnt get so warm that I can heat the room with it. I wanted something that the whole family can enjoy together and if possible with some sort of ""activity"".

So I went to Akihabara (Electric Town) in central Tokyo  where all the good customer and game maniacs go queueing from the last night in front of the shop for the newest game ;-)

The Xbox was supposed to have the widest choice of games (at least outside of Japan), is not s expensive as the PSP3 but I remember from some time back that there was a heating issue with the first version, which didnt make me feel so comfortable.

The PSP3 has a superb graphic and is probably state of the art but somehow gave me the impression that mostly hardcore game-maniacs would use it on their 50 inch flat screen monitor or with a projector. Playing it on such a big screen is great but can make you real exhausted if you look at it for 2+ hours. Eventually virtual world and real world change their meaning. Playing it on a small screen wouldnt really justify the extra cost.

The Wii seemed to be the kind of console which doesnt take up half the room and heating it all up and spend a fortune on power consumption, so that was nice to see.
Wii also comes with games and accessorie which my 3 year old daughter can enjoy at least watching, while PSP3 and Xbox 360 have a strong focus towards violence intensive action games which I wouldnt want her to enjoy at least for now.

I also wanted to spend some quality time with my family again doing some fun games.
A friend of mine already had a Wii and was very enthusiastic about the way the ""Wiimote"" (The remote of Wii) is working. He enjoyed the simple fact that for many games you actually have to move your body.

So for me it became very quickly clear that the Wii is the best choice for us.
Game maniacs or hardcore action game lovers will want to choose the PSP3, or (if you dont have so much money) the Xbox360.

As I found it hard at the beginning to quickly find sometimes which kind of category / age / target users a game is focused towards I have created my own game lists here on Amazon on which I will also list up games that are not yet available outside of Japan.

Hopefully some readers will find it useful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_189?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=189&reviewerType=all_reviews"

As of January 2014 over 100 million units have been sold worldwide. That's almost 1 Wii per every 3 people in the US. Why was the Wii so popular? The answer is simple. The Wii appeals to everyone. Most of all, the Wii appeals to families. Their entire marketing scheme was based around the fact that the Wii is fun for the whole family and easy to use by all. Some of the ads even had grandma's playing the game console!

The biggest negative point, and my only con, of this console was that it was being released in the HD era but not in HD, right before the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, both of which ran games in HD while the PS3 even had a Blu-ray drive. Therefore, the consoles resolution and frame rate would not be able to exceed 480p and 60 fps and it plays neither Blu-Rays nor DVDs but does offer video streaming services such as Netflix. Perhaps the Wii's best and most appealing feature is it's motion sensing technology. Being able to use the Wii remote as a baseball bat or tennis racket gives you a feeling that you are actually IN the game, no other console offered anything like this at the time. Nintendo's evolution from the standard candy bar style controller from the NES and SNES days to the Nintendo 64 and Gamecube controllers took a step back to the simpler build and it worked perfectly. This design allows games to be played on the Wii remote by pointing the remote at the screen, or simply turning it sideways. There is also several accessories that can be used in conjunction with the Wii remote such as the nunchuck, which has a separate analog stick and can be held in one hand while the remote is held in the other, and even a Classic Controller, which much resembles that of the Super Nintendo.

The console is quite easy to set up, the sound the Wii produces is decent but it is certainly feels like it is held back by it's lack of High-definition support. The user interface is incredibly easy to use, all you do is point and click, similar to using a computer and mouse.

The Wii offered lots of Nintendo's great, classic gaming characters in fun games but it felt like something was missing. It wasn't until the Wii U was released that it became apparent that what was missing was the upgrade in resolution. The best thing about the original Wii by far was that it opened the door for family gaming, easily allowing anyone to pick up a remote and join in on a game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_173?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=173&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When it was before it's time I drooled like a fanboy at the notion, watching the previews and imagining the possibilities.

When it came out I loved me some WiiSports, and fell in love with the Mii channel. I even made a web site about the Wii...

Now here I am a year later and I've barely touched it. Sure, Mario Galaxy is fun, and to some degree WiiSports hasn't lost it's charm... and Metroid, oh, wonderful and beautiful Metroid... but alas, this system is collecting dust. It simply doesn't have any of the games the Xbox 360 has been graced with, and it doesn't quite handle Blu Ray movies as well as my PS3.

Smash Bros. may get some juice into it's circuit boards for a few weeks, and Mario Kart is coming in ""Early 08 - I mean April - I mean Early 09 - I mean..."" and that will surely rock.

But is it enough?

The Wii seems to present a limitless landscape of possibilities for games, but unfortunately, Nintendo doesn't know what the internet is and third-parties don't want to waste time with motion controls or big budget games.

The result? It's like handicap children in a playground. It's not fair. It's not fun. It almost makes you feel kind of sad.

Verdict? The Wii has nothing going for it. Let the next snaggle-toothed, hype-train-riding, Coca-Cola drinking sell-out buy it instead. It's a better fashion accessory than it is a gaming console.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_278?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=278&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I would only recommend the Wii to people with young children (13 and under) or people that want a game system just for fun when they have company. The Wii lacks games for hardcore gamers. It doesn't get the majority of multiplatform games that the 360 and PS3 do because of its weak hardware. Most 3rd party titles are a joke. The 1st party games are fun, but the same that we've seen for years. Aside from Super Mario Galaxy, its the same old Mario Party, Zelda, Metroid Prime, Mario Kart, etc that have been around for years. It's like a Gamecube with motion controlls. I did love Mario Galaxy, one of the best games so far this gen. Other then that though, pickins are slim. With games like Assassin's Creed, Bioshock, Oblvion, Fallout, Soul Calilber, Street Fighter, Burnout Paradise, Modern Warfare, and so many more that are on PS3 or 360, the choice is clear. Also keep in mind 360 and PS3 both have awesome exclusives of their own. The one saving grace for the Wii is it does have access to download (for way too much money) old school games.

Hardware:

The hardware is very weak, almost last gen. It does have full backwards compatiblity for the gamecube which is nice. The console itself seems well built. No red rings of death here. Lack a lot of memory, but does have SD expandable memory. Motion Control.

But for the rest of us average-joe mostly non-gamers this is a totally fun system.

It's easy to enjoy all the standard games with only a small level of gaming ability.  Just be ready with Tiger Balm when you're done to address the strain in your shoulder joints.  I seriously thought about icing mine after a strenuous game of tennis.

Also, this system travels beautifully.  Pack it up and take it to the next party you go too.

I know some folks may think lowly of the Wii as it isn't as hardcore of a system (owing to its games) as the other seriously hardcore gaming systems out there, but who died and decided that a video game systems couldn't simply be mindless and fun?  Geeze, isn't that how video games started out anyways?

Highly recommend this for couples, families, older folk, tennis players, those who dream of touring withe PBA or PGA and anyone else in between.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_197?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=197&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The controls are top-notch, however.  The games are generally fun, simple and family-friendly.  True to Nintendo's vision of the system, anyone is able to just pick it up and play.  The Virtual Console has a plethora of great classic games from almost every past console (NES, SNES, Genesis, Master System, NEO-GEO, Turbografx-16, MSX), plus it's fully backwards compatible with GameCube discs and also includes its own WiiWare service for original downloadable games.  This makes its game library enormous.

The cons:  It's small, humble appearance is due to the lack of horsepower under that hood.  Nintendo has stripped the console of almost every aspect that defines the current generation of gaming.  There is no HD output, which is curious since more and more people are purchasing HDTV's.  The display looks awful on an LCD screen.  The graphics are great for cartoony games, but it cannot compete with current hardcore games as it's about on-par with the prior GameCube and PlayStation 2.  Most disturbing is the severe lack of storage memory.  At 256 MB, it's simply NOT enough if you download several games or channels and also have lots of game save data.  Wii has an optional SD memory card slot, but while you can store games and files there, the Wii cannot play directly off of it, which means you have to manually move files back and forth to be able to use them.  Game-wise, all your favorite Nintendo franchises make their Wii appearance (Mario, Zelda, Metroid), but there's a horrible lack of good 3rd party games.  In fact, the Wii game library is overrun with 3rd party shovelware that's barely worth $10.  This will be a serious issue if Nintendo wants to maintain their position in the #1 spot.

Wii is a good system, but if you're looking for true next-gen gaming, better go with a PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_194?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=194&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When you feel the need to ""blow stuff up"", a console from Xbox or Playstation might be a good fit. But there are a couple of things that those consoles don't do well. And Wii picks up that slack very nicely indeed.

1)
Getting your parents and grandparents involved. The first time I had my parents over after I got the Wii, I put in the sports disc (that comes in this package) and started up tennis. My mom asked, ""How do I serve"". I asked how she would serve if she were really playing tennis (something which she hasn't done in many years due to heart problems). She made the motion and, VOILA!, her avatar served the ball.

My dad, who I don't think has played a video game with me since we got Pong when I was a kid, kicked my butt in Bowling the first time he played.

What I'm saying is the controllers really are very intuitive even for ""non-gamers"" and the games are fun for all ages.

2)
Party settings. I love Halo and other games like that, but it isn't much fun to watch other people play, especially for non-gamers.

On the other hand, with great party games like Rayman Raving Rabbids 2, the Wii becomes almost as much fun to watch others play as it is to play yourself. That's because, when done right, people stand up and make fools of themselves while competing against other guests.

---
One word of caution, though: Really do strap on those wiimotes. Sweaty palms could really ruin your day if you throw a wiimote through your TV. (This has never happened to me, but we always strap up.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The first game I bought was Legend of Zelda, and I'm still playing it after 20+ hours of gameplay. In addition, I've made a point of taking advantage of all the games that Nintendo sells through its online service for download. Yes, you heard it right: Nintendo, Genesis, SNES, N64 and now even Neo-Geo ... all of these games can be downloaded to the Wii and played (price varies, of course). For those of us who grew up with video games, it's an amazing chance to replay old favorites and pick up ones we never had a chance to play.

As for the Wii games, the style and content vary wildly. Just about anyone can find something they like, and the innovative motion controls can be put to great use (and sometimes not-so-great use, so it's a good idea to check the reviews before buying a game). More new games are coming out now, and some of the ports from previous systems--especially PS2--are still fun to play if you haven't had a chance to pick them up previously. The graphics will never be as good as those on the Xbox360 or PS3, but that's not a huge hang-up for most.

The only thing this system is missing now is a hardcore game. Xbox 260 has Halo 3 and Bioshock, and PS3 has Resistance. Wii came close with Metroid, but it's just not enough. I see a lot of opportunity with Wii for gritty first-person shooters, strategy games like Rome: Total War or even Command and Conquer, and other games like Star Wars Battlefront. Once Wii begins to take advantage of these areas, then it will have everything.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_179?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=179&reviewerType=all_reviews"

And the games are a blast.  With Wii sports, my mother, father, and girlfriend(three people who haven't touched a game console since the original Nintendo) all get together to play bowling.

The only problem I can see is that after a couple hours of playing games like Monkeyball and Elibits, my right wrist that holds the Wiimote really starts to hurt.  I wouldn't be surprised to see Wii carpal tunnel for alot of heavy gamers in a couple of years.  You must take a break or you will be hurting the next day.

how can i explain this better. the Wii is mario party to the extreme. every game on the wii, because of the controller, feels like a fun goofy game. the more i play it the more i feel it was built for mario tennis. this is the ultimate get your friends togther. girls and guys. and goof off over a few drinks.

this system succeeded in every way possible at accomplishing what it was meant to do. which is be a fun, easy to use, addictive system. but it is not trying to, nor can it ever, replace an xbox 360 for a hard core gamer. once again.. they are apples and oranges.

The problem with this console right now is that it is very hard to get your hands on unless you pay a fair amount more money and buy it from a private seller, and there aren't many games out for the system yet. Unless your really excited about a new game that HAS been released (like I was), I might suggest waiting for the hype to die down a bit and some new games to come out, and then you may be able to get one for a better price. It's definately worth checking out, though.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_265?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=265&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Thats only after waiting outside other various stores for weeks on end. Those of you who have rated the Wii poorly (collecting dust) and what have you...why aren't there more for sale in used then?
With that said...some of it's true. Games: blah. When it first came out i couldn't find anything i really really enjoyed. Excite Truck, Need for Speed and of course Zelda.
NOW though...upcoming releases like resident evil chronicals where you play like you're in an arcade, only to be followed up by the release or the wii zapper. Guitar Hero III comming out for the Wii, tomb raider, mario galaxy, boxing...there are just so many being released in the next few months.
I think the wii is very versitle and while at first the wii wasn't really for heavy gamers because the graphics aren't PS3 style (but compare them to the atari and what do you have? great graphics) but now they have made up for the graphics (which i think are perfectly acceptable, if i wanted perfect graphics i'd just watch a movie in high-def) by producing games for the avid gamer and games for the family (mario kart is comming out soon).
All in all it's been a long while coming where the wii could please a family of 7, while also pleasing the lonely heart who sits infront of his/her computer with a mt. dew and snacks thanking the lord for halo 3.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_212?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=212&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Although I have been playing video games since Pong, the Wii is the first game console I have owned. I love video games, but being a mom with three boys I don't have much time to play and when I do I like to do something that involves my family. But I was an arcade junkie in high school and college and I still enjoy blasting aliens and beating up bad guys.

However, the reason I never bought a console before because I didn't really see an advantage over PC gaming. Now, I love detailed graphics (which is why I preferred computer games for so many years) but to me that is not all that gaming is about. The PS3 and Xbox360 games look awesome, but when you get down to it, you are still just pressing buttons. And you can punch buttons on a PC just like the consoles. So for me there weren't enough differences between the PC and a game console to justify the extra cost of a dedicated game machine and the more expensive games. Then came the Wii.

Now for all of you that have been gaming for years--every day of your life, for several hours a day--I can see why you wouldn't like the Wii. All those years of training your thumbs to move little joysticks and perfecting rapid button pushing skills are mostly useless when you pick up a Wii remote. This is not the console for the hardcore gamer.

But for the rest of us, the Wii is the great equalizer.

I have tried to play video games with my boys in the past but it would take me most of the time I had to play, just to figure out how to get started. My boys were always very patient and helpful, but I'm sure that the only reason they weren't bored out of their minds was just because I was spending time with them. I doubt they got much fun from playing with me. (Well, other than the entertainment of watching mom's characters kill themselves 30 times in a row because I kept pushing the wrong buttons.) Now, we can actually have fun playing together. My boys have put in lots more gaming hours than I have, and the first couple of weeks we had the Wii they could beat me at just about everything. Now not only can I play, but I can sometimes obliterate them. Hee-hee.

I love the motion controls. It is not just a gimmick to me. It is much more natural and fun. Yes, playing Lego Star Wars on the PC is fun, but for a lifelong Star Wars fan like myself, getting to swing the Wii-mote around like a light saber in Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga is just about worth the price of the system alone.

I am also very happy with Nintendo itself. After months of heavy use, our Wii developed a disc drive problem one week before Christmas. Now, you could say that this means it is a defective product. But I have had tons of computers and sometimes you just get a bad drive. This is why you have a warranty. Anyway, we had bought games and more Wii-motes and Nunchuks for the kids and it would really wreak our presents if the Wii wasn't there for Christmas. They explained they would do their best but there were no guarantees. To make a long story short, at absolutely no cost to me they shipped it back the repair shop, fixed it, and shipped it overnight so that it arrived on the morning of the 24th. Stuff like that makes me a lifelong fan.

The Wii is really great for wet, cold winter days when it is too miserable to go out and play. When people are sick and we can't go anywhere, we can still go bowling. (Unfortunately, the Wii controls are very realistic and I am just as bad bowling at the virtual bowling alley as I am at the real one.)  My whole family is having a ton of fun with this. We used to spend evenings sitting watching DVD together--now we play games together. Now, I've actually seen people complain about the fact that you can't just sit and play, but that's what I like about it the most.

We have a Tigger in our family who can't stay still for more than a few seconds at a time. Getting him to sit down and play a board game is next to impossible. We would have to call him back from across the house every time it was his turn, so having a family game night was pretty much out--until now. Now we can play Mario Party 8,Godzilla Unleashed, or whatever and he can have fun and bounce around all he wants. Fun without the stress.

I highly recommend the Wii. You get a whole lot of bang for your buck. For the less than the price of a PS3, I have bought the console plus 3 Wii Remote Controllers, 3 Wii Nunchuk Controllers, and had enough left over to buy several games. But more importantly, it has been a fun addition, beneficial addition to our family. The Wii definitely makes my lifetime list of Best Purchases I Have Ever Made.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_199?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=199&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have had my wii for a little less than 6 months and I'm already bored with my games. But I have found some fun in the Wii Shopping Channel. You can buy old games and new games from $5-$15 which is great compared to the $30-$50 games in stores. Other than that the Wii itself is great with some interesting channels.

I hope this helps.

I am what you may call a gamer aficionado. I have been around since the NES release and have played them all including back dating myself to the Atari 2600. This review is intended to clarify some points for the more casual gamer, and will cover this and last generation of consoles by maker.

Nintendo - The first in my list because this is the first you will recognize.

And we will start off with last generation, the Gamecube. Gamecube was intended for children. And let it be known that it didn't disappoint. Gamecube has released some very solid titles, including Metroid, Mario, Zelda, and Smash Brothers. I know there are going to be comments made about this, but remember, this is for the casual gamer and the casual gamer will enjoy and appreciate the quirkiness of Smash Bros. without noticing the minor flaws. So back to the review. The Gamecube has maintained solid four-player gaming and has re-released a few titles (Zelda: Ocarina of Time) that will make it well worth the purchase. Not to mention the Gameboy Advance interface (Especially for you Pokemon fans) and the price. The Gamecube is by far the cheapest ""new"" console on market.

But the Wii, in addition to being the cheapest new generation (I refuse to call them next-gen anymore) will also play all the old Gamecube games (A feat X-Box missed the mark on). And for those of you who knew that your parents grew up on NES or just really want to know what 16-bit gaming was all about, the Wii includes an internet feature which will allow you to download all the classics you missed out on (read as They will charge you to play classic Nintendo games). There is a one time fee involved, so don't fret too much (although it's a little high for someone also shelling out around $50 a game for other consoles as well). The Wii is fun and innovative, and if you want to feel more involved in the game, Nintendo nailed it. The new controllers are completely motion sensitive without losing the function of an analog stick. The button systems are intuitive although a little frustrating (i.e. you point the controller just off the screen when trying to aim). Nintendo did a great job growing up.

The Bad - Although the cheapest in the bunch it is also the most difficult to find. I got lucky and bought mine just when it was added online. You'll probably have to ask when a store gets shipments in and trail the truck in from the freeway. Also, although the Wii plays all old titles, you'll still have to purchase ""old"" controllers to play them. The online is fun as well. Mii's alone are worth it. BUT, the store will frequently freeze unless your wireless internet is set up just right. (There is a connection for wired internet, but what do you need that for if the Wii has a wireless modem built in?)

The verdict - All in all, you'll be incredibly happy with a Wii and for a Casual Gamer you may not need anything else. All things considered: 5 out of 5 for the casual gamer. The joy of playing this fun console, the price and Wii Sports which comes included with the console far out-weigh the inaccuracies and glitches held within the controller and the fact that this little thing only produces picture in regular definition, not High-Definition..

X-Box - Microsoft threw it down when they teamed up with Sega to create what they hoped would be (and may still become) the ultimate gaming console.

The original X-Box was created to be very much a devoted computer: devoted to gaming. There were even computer mod chips readily available to enhance your playing experience and the hard drive was upgradeable. Granted the casual gamer would need a friend to do the changes and probably wouldn't even know the difference (except for the interface) unless that same friend pointed it out. Now this is a new system put out by a ""new"" company, so there is no backwards compatibility (you can't play any old games). The controller is probably the most comfortable (in my opinion) and the games are mostly nice to look at. There are some moments (Halo) when you'll even find yourself standing still in the game to stare at the scenery. Being a new system make sure you at least get Version 2 (I had a V 1 that heated up very quickly, but I kept the V 1 controller for my own comfort... it's bigger, my hands are big... enough said). But when it came down to it, Microsoft's online play was probably the biggest achievement. For the first time, there was an online community that eased the ability of online console multiplayer. Of course I'm referring to X-Box Live. Which lives and strives in it's updated version.

X-Box Live is a must if you want the X-Box 360. How else can you boast about your achievements? Which brings me to ""Gamerscore"". On the X-Box 360, Microsoft introduced Gamerscore as a method of getting gamers addicted to playing. And it worked. I can't tell you how many times PacMan ate three of the powerpellets and died making it to the fourth. But about the 360. The console sends picture in High-Definition. That's 720p HD by the way, not the 1080p Sony and Blueray are pushing. What does that mean? That means better, more realistic picture. But not perfect or ""super-real"" which is a term that has been used to describe Gran-Tourismo HD for the PS3. It means seeing your car splash through puddles, seeing skin stretch with joints bending and muscles flexing. And speaking of HDTV, The 360 will play HDDVD's, but only with a $150 driver. Otherwise, you'll be limited to the same old 480p. The 360 has focused primarily on the First-Person-Shooters, it seems, gaining some ground in Role-Playing-Games. Which leads me to say, for the casual gamer, This console could become a little expensive. X-Box Live has built an arcade in which (once again) you pay a one-time fee to play old games (as well as some new ones) off your console. Also, unless you're going to spend $35 every three to five games for memory cards, you'll have to pay at least $100 for a hardrive. The 360 plays ""most"" of the old X-Box games, and they are working on updating their software continually to try to add more. Another annoyance is that every game you play will download an update for it's online play, achievements and sometimes even patch an in-game glitch. This I am classifying as an annoyance because it 1) takes up memory and 2) isn't a one-time deal. Some games will have three or four updates the first time you play. But I have nothing to complain about as far as the interface, playability, and mid- to high- level games for casual and hardcore gamers. Did I mention the computer sync which will allow you to operate your computer from your X-Box?

The Bad - Although X-Box 360 is nothing to scoff at (unless you are a die-hard PS fan that refusing to acknowledge the PS3 is/will be a failure) it may be a little daunting for the casual gamer who wants a quiet, quirky, fun platformer. There are a few out there, and they do seem to be increasing in number (what with now trying to compete with the Wii) but the 360 doesn't seem to have anything mainstream that isn't full of glitches. Thank you Sonic The Hedgehog. The casual gamer will find him/herself in the arcade more often than playing a real game. The console heats up (still) quickly which means (once again) make sure you get at least a Version 2, and even so you may want a cooling unit (NOT NYKON). The console sounds like a jet engine. And I don't exaggerate. There is not doubt about when it is on or off. Everything is expensive (Thank you Microsoft). Games are $55 or more, controllers are $40, memory is $35 a pop, even arcade games are no less than $6 and most run $12 or $18. Microsoft even went so far as to maximize profits by ceasing production of X-Box games to focus on the 360.

The Verdict - This console is my second choice for Casuals. The 360 is certainly more grown up and you'll be able to grow up faster on the 360 than on a Wii, but unless you know someone who you trust to recommend games to you, you'll end up getting difficult games and miss out on the fun. Don't worry, you'll get your chance to be pwned! But if you jump out to Gears of War online Versus Match too soon, you'll just get slaughterer and frustrated and crawl up with BeJeweled in the Arcade. After all is said and done, the 360 gets a 4 out of 5 for the casual gamer. Make a friend at your local game store - someone who won't try to sell you a $60 game because it's `pretty' - and go out and get your game on.

Playstation - since it was introduced, it was Sega's only competition, N64 was old and Gamecube didn't bring back the following they had hoped. After Sega CD, Sega Saturn and finally Sega Dreamcast (probably the most under valued console of gaming history) Sega threw in the towel and sided with Microsoft to aid with the X-Box. Playstation has been loyal to fans and works backwards compatibility all the way back to the PSone.

But we will ignore the PSone and skip straight to the PS2. The PS2 has focused, it seems, in RPG (Role-Playing-Games). Try saying ""Final Fantasy sucks"" in a crowded room* without invoking both applause and anger. *I don't actually recommend this, and I assume no responsibility for those that do try and get beat up.* These RPG's span from the quirky and fun to the Dark and Brooding. So there is no sense in talking about finding something you'll enjoy (as long as you like RPG's). There are plenty of platformers as well. Although the PS2 has probably the best selection for the casual gamer as well as more of the mainstream titles, it's controller is the most uncomfortable and possibly the least functional. There are four ""triggers"" that are not pressure sensitive. This makes racing very difficult. I went so far as to change the settings to make the throttle the second analog stick. The PS2 is a horse. You can play for hours without fatiguing the console. Of course, most of the games are meant to be played for hours at a time. There are wireless capabilities, but it requires buying separate wireless controllers (the wired controllers are only about 6' long) which will have you connect a receiver into the front of your console. Memory is fairly cheap, especially if you find a sale (which happens frequently) and you don't mind buying third party (Not Sony). Sony is a name drop and you should expect to pay the price for it. Playstation has also included online play, but it is through ISP's (casuals should have their friends set them up to begin with), not through a community.

You'll notice I'm speaking about the PS2 like I have the new-generations of the other companies even though there is a PS3. That's because the PS3 is NOT for casual gamers. PS3 ended up in a ""anything you can do I can do better"" kick and offered up specs that far surpassed any console that has preceeded. But they paid the price. Or rather, you'll pay the price. The console has a base price of $600. Although it is the only console to offer 1080p High Definition picture, it is very difficult to find good games because, 1) There aren't that many games - it is very difficult to program for the PS3 - and 2) The games that do exist never live up to the hype. Sony has simply made it too difficult to publish a ""good"" game (read a game free of MAJOR glitches) on their new console. Leave the PS3 for the Playstation devouts. It is NOT for the casual gamer. So I return to the PS2.

The Bad - The PS2 controllers are slightly uncomfortable. You may want to get third party controllers and accept the fact that you'll have to sit no further than six feet from the console. The triggers (although there are four of them) don't have enough play to be effectively pressure sensitive. The online play is through ISP, which can make it difficult for a casual to get involved (I recommend inviting a friend over to help you out). Because it is last-generation, it produces picture in regular definition. There are upgrade wires (component and S-video) to improve picture quality, but it's still not high-definition.

The Verdict - The PS2 gets a 4 out of 5 for casual gamers (the PS3 gets a 2 out of 5). There is nothing that can be said that I haven't already. The PS2 is a great console, but lacks a few creature comforts that in this day and age, a console needs. No surprise as it is last gen. This console is going to be the cheapest, seeing as it is older. But with several updated models (Slim, Silver) and the capability to play DVD's without a remote, it will fit your entertainment area nicely. Although this console received the same score as the 360, I feel the PS2 will rank 3rd simply because the price simply doesn't make up for it's age.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_207?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=207&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I am hooked!!!","December 9, 2006","My wife and I won a drawing for the opportunity to purchase the console at our local BX and although she was a little bit skeptical about this system at first, she jumped on the opportunity to purchase this hot item on everyone's Christmas list. Besides, it was all I could talk about since Nintendo first code-named it the ""Revolution"" (which would have been a better name since the game play is so revolutionary compared to other systems). The system is extremely easy to setup and connect to the internet. The real simplicity however comes to the controls.

After a brief tutorial, the controller feels very natural and the innovative design truly allows you to feel like you are more in ""control"" of what your on-screen character is doing. My wife picked up on it right away as did I and now I don't know who is more addicted, her or I!!!

Upon first contact with the system you will notice how small and surprisingly heavy the system is. But after all, they packed a truly remarkable system into a small form factor that takes up very little space and looks very curious compared to other pricier and bulky systems.

The price was great for the system, the games seem very decently priced and of course I am psyched because I got the one thing that I wanted for Christmas already. Now I can drive by and smile at all the little fanboys twiddling their thumbs and waiting impatiently in line for a ridiculously  overpriced PS3 which has VERY LITTLE AVAILABILITY and in my non-expert opinion will not likely achieve the ability to compete against the big N's remarkable offering to the current console wars.

Oh yeah, a bit of advice, grab any extra controllers you might find in the stores because we had to search extensively to find an extra controller that wasn't being sold for 3 times the amount you'd expect to pay at a retailer.

One word to sum up the WII: Awesome!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_179?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=179&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Wii has definitely found a niche, and I think that niche will prove to be not just ""tween,"" ""teen,"" and ""20-something"" crowd, but the entire family.  I knew something was going on when my 11-year old had his 69-year-old grandmother doing ""virtual"" bowling with him and laughing hysterically.

Where do I start?  First, I like the diminutive footprint of this unit and the silence.  We replaced a Sony Playstation 2 with the Wii.  My biggest grip with the PS2 was that it sounded like a freight train...the fan was very, very noisy.

The Wii hasn't tried to outmuscle the competition.  They've done something smarter: they've tried to be different.  The PS3 is big, powerful (and probably noisy), expensive, and not selling all that well at $[...]+ a pop.  In contrast, my son is perfectly satisfied with the $[...] Wii (he had to pay for it from his own savings), and I like the fact that the Wii system requires more physical interaction than just moving your thumbs.

I also like the integrated wireless capabilities of the Wii.  It took me about 3 minutes to get it connected to my home wireless network, which is an absolute world record compared to the frustration of getting other devices connected (such as my office laptop).  Nintendo did a great job of making this simple, and writing a decent manual with step-by-step instructions.  I put the MAC address into my router's list of trusted devices and within minutes - voila - we were connected.  The device downloaded a firmware update and then installed a nifty utility called ""the internet channel"" that lets us surf the 'net from the living room on our TV screen using the Wii.  [...].  Very cool.

We've only had the system for a couple of days and haven't explored all the features yet.  My son has had fun building little ""Mii"" characters (sort of like screen avatars) for himself, his pals, me, grandma, aunts and uncles, etc.  We've also watched weather forecasts and news now that it is connected to the internet, and of course, he's played games (the Sports disk that comes bundled with the Wii...and a Mario Party 8 disk).

The number of titles currently available for the Wii seem to be rather limited, but since the Wii is backward compatible with Gamecube disks, there is a library of 545 compatible games from that platform to choose from as the Wii builds up its own library.

The game controller itself is very innovative and is definitely what makes this system appealing to the over-18 crowd -- all the way up to the AARP crowd.

One neat little feature for parents is the daily log that shows how much time has been spent doing activities.  So now when those inevitable disagreements come up about how much time ""Junior"" has spent in front of the TV screen, you'll actually have an impartial log to turn to.  The first day, my son spent 6 hours and 47 minutes -- but that will be the exception, not the rule.  Grandma let him go overboard with his new toy.

If you are a hard-core gamer that has to have photo-realistic graphics, then this probably isn't the system for you.  But if you are looking for something the entire family can enjoy, and doesn't try to be a ""me too"" system like the PS3 and Xbox 360, I think you'll find this system to be very innovative, very interactive, and very fun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_181?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=181&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Our entire extended family (aged 7-70) has greatly enjoyed taking swings in Wii Sports. Bowling seems to be a favorite, with tennis a close second. Our other ""more serious"" titles (Zelda, Madden, Tony Hawk) have also seen play and so far the Wii delivers on almost all fronts.

And for those of you wanting a workout....holy cow....just playing the sports games that come with it will give you a good workout.

We give this system 5 stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_280?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=280&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Although they have had a very strong lineup with the Gamecube including Super Smash Brothers Melee, The Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and Super Mario Sunshine, many people seemed to really be more interested in the Playstation 2 and Xbox. Nevertheless, the company needed to find a new way for gamers to play all sorts of great games. That definitely hits well with the Nintendo Wii. Since the hype grew back last year with the new methods we can play video games, can this new system can redefine video games at home forever? The answer is really YES!!!

The Nintendo Wii game system is a new system that really changes the way we play video games. The gameplay on this system is all featured on a wireless remote which you can use your body to move your characters around in new ways. The system comes with a wired remote, a nunchuck analog controller attachment, and has a internal memory where you can store all your video game data. The system does include Wii Sports, which is a fantastic mini-game compilation that warms you up to the new ways you can play baseball from swinging the controller like a bat and a racket to play tennis, to a simple pair of boxing gloves in Boxing that you can use to knockout opponents. The remote also works great for games like Excite Truck, that you can use as a steering wheel to drive your car, or a fishing rod to catch reekfish in The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess.

The compatability with the system also works great for Gamecube owners as well. You can also play your classic Gamecube games on this system like Mario Kart: Double Dash, and Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. All you need to do is simply plug your gamecube controllers into the specialty port, and you can play all those great games Gamecube lovers know and love. The only disadvantage with this is that you can't turn the system off with the Wii remote whenever you play a gamecube game. Instead, you have to turn it off from the main console itself, whcih isn't a big problem. You also can download a whole deal of great classic games from Nintendo's past into the virtual console, and play wonderful games like Super Mario 64 from the Nintendo 64 system, and The Legend Of Zelda from the NES era. You can also download great games from other classic consoles, including the Sega Genesis and Turbographx 16. You can play classic games like Sonic The Hedgehog and Bonk's Revenge that you download from the Wii's online shop, and just play away.

While other systems like the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 are more about the hype and cost more bang for your bucks, the Nintendo Wii really does deliver in a fantastic system that does deliver in changing not just the way we play video games, but keeps the fun alive for everyone young and old alike. Although I had a tough time trying to find the system, it is really worth the purchase. I love this system, and if you're a die hard Nintendo fan or someone who doesn't yet have a video game system, you'll love the Wii too.

COLLEY","Wii has made a fan of Mii","May 21, 2007","I admit I thought the controller idea was very cheesey at first, but wow is it a blast. This thing is great at parties and oh the stories I can tell you about friends playing the home-run derby drunk... lets just say thank GOD for the wrist-strap. The only flaw to the active remote... and its a mild one, is that for folks who play video-games to relax or wind down from a stressful day the entire effort it takes to play some games can be a bummer... but in that case I say just download a classic NES, SNES, N64, SEGA, or TG16 game.

Conclusion: It's not a perfect system, but I can honestly say it DOES live up to alot of the hype, and well worth the purchase price for a novice or hardcore gamer.

Positives: Crowd pleaser at party, player feels more ""into"" the game, Opera net browser works well... not perfect but well and is free (till June), downloadable games for fee, free download of a wii survey channel, Gamecube games controller and mem card compatibility, built-in wireless works well, small footprint and convinence of wireless controller out of the box, Decent free game included (no one does thing anymore), free Wii weather channel is a neat idea that still needs work (data is a bit outdated).

Negatives: NO DVD movie support (rumored to be included on future versions), wirless keyboard a MUST option for net surfing (but not available as of yet), Downloadable video game library is extremely limited, wired ethernet connection addition accessory, Wii points system can burn you (extra points are often times wasted becuase of varies in price and limiting the purchase amounts), Game library still need much more growth, limited availability of consoles","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_235?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=235&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I won't go into technical details on this system for the simple fact that by now you've heard them all. However, I will say this, just in case your like me and skeptical at how well the motion sensor works and how ""fun"" it is to flail around your living room hitting tenis balls on the screen...ITS FUN!!! Thats right I said it. I'm normally an XBOX or Playstation fan and when I saw this I wasn't even planning on getting it. It seemed like something only small children would like. I'm the type of guy who likes to sit back and drink a beer with the guys while we talk crap and play madden. So the idea of swinging an imaginary bat seemed juevenile and just plain dorky to me. I went ahead and got it with my wife in kids in mind, I figured it'd keep them busy while I was on my PS3 or my 360. Well it turns out that this thing is fun, incredibly accurate and family oriented. I can't remember the last time we could all sit in the same room and play each other and have a good time. Its easy enough that my wife, who doesnt play games, can do it, and challenging enough that I could enjoy it. We played the Wii Sports all night and had a blast. I guess the point of this review is to let the ""tough guys"" like myself, know that this system is worth every penny, and to folks with families this thing can be a cheap date on Sat. if your looking for some family fun. I didn't abandon my 360 or PS3, but this is something we can all do together. My boys will be coming by this weekend and I'm gonna hand it to them in baseball LOL.

I guess this is more of a testimonial than a review LOL, ah well you get the point","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_187?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=187&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It has the best price on all the consoles even though the graphic capabilities are not as good as the other two consoles because the wii operates on 480p graphics while the PS3 and 360 operate on or around 1080p. But don't be fulled by graphic capabilities if the games are not fun there is no point in having all those graphics.
This is where the Wii takes the cake it makes even some boring games loads of fun like baseball. I will devote sections of this review to each major part of the Wii.

The first part is the system itself. Like i said before it isn't the most powerful system but it still sports very good graphics.
Three of the best graphics games are Legend of Zelda, Mario, and Metroid. One of the coolest features is the self loading disc slot.
This cuts down on scratching, alot! It can also self load gamecube games. This system is fully backward compatible with all gamecube games
there is no software to download or anything like that. You just load it in and you are ready to play. On the back of the system there are
five ports three near the bottom two near the top. The three on the bottom are for the sensor bar, the cord that goes to the plug and the cord that goes into the DVD player. The two near the top are USB ports for things like keyboards when your surfing the web or using Wiiconnect24. This system is also very quiet you don't even hear it running. When first powering up the system you will go through the same process on the DS. They will ask you for your birthday what time it is ask you to set parental settings etc. After that each time you turn it on you will go through a be sure to read the health and safety manual before playing video games warning. Also there is a 512MB flash memory inside the system you can also copy memory to a SD card slot on the front of the system provided you have a SD card. On top there are slots for four gamecube controllers and two gamecube memory cards. These slots have coverings that can flip down and up. Another feature is you have the choice to lay the console on its side or stand it up with the included stand.

Part two is about the channels. When you first start the system you will have six channels the weather channel, the news channel, the Wii shop channel, the Mii channel, the picture channel and most importantly the game channel. In the lower right hand corner of the
channel menu you can acces Wiiconnect24. In the lower left hand corner you can access the settings and memory.
To access a channel you just pooint at it with your Wiimote select it then push start.
The game channel is where you start any gamecube or Wii game except wii fit wich will make its own channel.
The Mii channel is where you make and edit Mii's. Mii's are used for games like Wii sports and Wii play and Wii fit.
Weather channel, shop channel, and news channel all require internet connection by either a wireless router, the nintendo wi-fi hub that plugs into your computers USB port, or the Wii LAN cable.
Now the shop channel is for buying other channels (i.e. vote channel) or old games from the NES, SNES, sega genisis Neo Geo, Nintendo 64, and Turbografxs 16. Wiiconnect24 is where you can send and recieve messages from other Wii owners that are on your friend list. Your friend code will be generated as soon as connect to the internet using Wiiconnect24.

Part three its about what you get in the package. What comes with the Wii besides the Wii is a stand, the sensor bar, the plug that goes to your wall, and the plug that goes into your DVD player. It also comes with
the quick setup manual, the owners manual, and the channel manual. A Wiimote, nunchuk, and the game Wii sports are also included. Wii sports is a game that has golf, bowling, tennis, baseball, and boxing. Really all it is is to get you used to how you are going to be using the Wiimote and what you can do with the Wiimote.

Part four is about the games. In my opinian nintendo has some of the best games on a console it has a wide range of titles and ratings.
It also has very good sequals to their classic titles like super mario sunshine and metroid prime 3. Although they have not released sequals to all their classic games they are sure to some time in the future life of the system. This system has games for every person in your family from hardcore to never even played a video game.

Part five is about internet service. This system unlike their prevous consoles has fully functional internet play. For the most part its free although their are some extras that you must pay for. To find a fully functional internet game all you have to do is look for a
blue circle in the upper left hand corner that has Wi-Fi in white letters. Their are also some games that use Wiiconnect24, but these games are not fully functioning internet games. Now i won't lie to you their internet games aren't the best but for bieng free their are very good.

In the end if your looking for a powerfull system that has lots of bells and whistles this isn't it, but if your looking for a fun system with
a few bells and whistles than the Wii is for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_286?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=286&reviewerType=all_reviews"

There are many games to choose from, so everyone should be able to find a game he likes. It does suck that only one control is included though.

It comes with Wii Sports, which is fantastic because you can instantly see just what the Wii brings to the table as far as an alternative to the XBox 360 and the PS3.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Nintendo fanboy, I had a PS2 and an Xbox but no Gamecube, and I think all three of the next-gen systems are great, so I'm not hyping the Wii at the others' expense, but people who compare it directly to those are missing the point.  As far as graphics and processor power and all that, the Wii is behind those.  But what Wii offers you is something that those can't.  It's like having one of those fancy video game arcades with all the crazy virtual games that cost a buck a minute right in your living room.  Heck, Wii Sports is practically like having a bowling alley in your living room.  And that's just one of the five sports included!  There are control issues here and there, especially with the boxing game, but most of the problem is realizing what movements the machine is looking for and which ones it interprets as what actions in the game.  All in all, I can't believe how much fun it is.  I can't wait to try Zelda and to see what other great games come out in the next year.  Highly recommended to anyone who likes fun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_185?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=185&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It covers an area of about 5ftx5ft or MORE once you have it set up correctly. It senses even the smallest movements.

One point ot be concidered is the players ability to imagine themselves in an environment. While intuition might tell you to point at the screen to aim, that's not the case. You actually have to aim where you normally would if you were in that situation. Thus, something like hitting a ball that's coming at you becomes tricky if you're aiming below you because that's the level of the tv. The Wii wants you to act naturally at your own body levels, not aiming at the screen like an end-all-be-all answer. It takes some getting used to.

I wish I had my Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess in order to see if these comments were useful there.

Bottom line: an excellent console that goes above and beyond, though it takes some self training to get used to the handling of the Wii remote. WELL worth the $250. More features should be added as the console gets older (more internet channels and the ability to connect to other players).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_215?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=215&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Once Nintendo switched from just A B and the cross controller, I found myself unable to coordinate my fingers and keep up with the technology. Since we have purchased the Wii, I have been able to play games again because I understand the controller. For the most part, you just point it at the TV and wave it around. You can make it as active or as passive as you want to.

They also have a wide range of games available for the Wii so all ages and skill levels can play on it. You can use the game cube games on it too.

Another cool thing is that you can use the Wi-Fi and link up with people around the world to play! Much funner than just playing with yourself and it helps you to develope your gaming skills. You can also download classic nintendo games. :)

I would recommend this to anyone! Well worth the money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_189?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=189&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I cannot believe how fun it is, even just bowling is a blast! The main reason I bought it is because my not quite 4 year old son is having surgery tomorrow and I wanted him to have something new to do to keep his mind off of the possible pain/discomfort he may be in so this is his early birthday/sorry you have to go thru surgery present! - and he and his brother have been playing mario kart all night and it's been a blast, it's lots of fun for all of us, even my husband who is even less into gaming systems than I am - he and I are looking forward to the kids going to bed so we can challenge each other to a game instead of mindlessly sitting in front of the tv. I'll admit the price tag hurt a little when I bought the Wii, Mario Kart, an extra remote and an extra wheel all at once, but I can tell it'll be well worth it. I can't wait to get the Wii Fit and Active and so much more. This is so great for families!

The basic concepts really remain the same...every once in awhile, you get something new, but by and large each game seems to be a knockoff of the previous.  Sequels are ubiquitous.  For that reason, I haven't really been a ""gamer"" since the NES was all the rage.  My brother has been a big gamer, so I always try his latest system or hot game, but can never really get into it...then he brought the Wii out to my house.  I have to say, Wii sports is very addictive.  Although these aren't the most realistic graphics by modern standards, the Wii remote more than makes up for this shortfall.  I find myself getting into the games, positioning myself as I really would for a real tennis or golf game.  I haven't played any of the other games yet, so I'm curious how the Wii remote holds up for all the others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_195?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=195&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When I unboxed my Wii, setup was a breeze, The sensor bar is unobtrusive and blends right in with the top of my TV. The following morning, I was fooling around with the Wii Shop Channel and my Wii automatically found my wireless DSL modem upstairs and connected to the internet! I was amazed. I was able to connect to the internet without running cables or even getting up off the couch!

The Wii does so much more than play games. You can get News and local weather, download classic NES, SNES, N64, Genesis, NeoGeo, and TurboGrafix 16 games. Wii points cost $.01 USD and the average game is 500 Wii points to download.

Know someone else who has a Wii? Exchange Wii Numbers and you can send messages back and forth.

The Wii Sports Pack is amazing! I woke up Monday morning with an aching shoulder, butt and thighs from bowling for close to six hours straight. The disc also includes a Personal Trainer of sorts. You play for five minutes at a combination of Golf, Baseball, Tennis, Bowling, and Boxing. And at the end, it gives you your Fitness Age (20 being the best possible age). My first day, I scored a 45, second day 38, and my third day I actually went UP (because I was sore from playing Wii and working at a tire factory) to 72!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_223?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=223&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The graphics power of the system is slightly better then the old Xbox. But if you have an HDTV, I recommend buying Component cables for the Nintendo Wii. It will make games look way better.

  As for the gameplay, It is quite enjoyable. It's easy to learn how to use the remote for anyone.  It's truly a game system for family and friends.  My Dad was able to quickly learn how to play some golf on Wii Sports. He is horrible when it comes to learning how to play games, or use electronics. He don't even know how to turn on a PC. It's amazing how much they can do with the remote and nunchuck. I can't wait to see what kind of games will come out in 2007.

I recomend this system to anyone who likes playing with their friends or family. If you value gameplay over graphics, then you came to the right place.

I liked the new features the Wii had when comparing it to the other consoles, but I wanted Halo 3 for the 360 which is coming out soon.  However, that's the only reason why I wanted the 360.  I'm a college guy, but despite what people say that the Wii is for kids only, think again.

The Wii has games for everybody alike.  You don't have to purchase the kid games if you don't want to; there are plenty of other options.  And with Legend of Zelda, Smash Brothers coming out in December, Guitar Hero III in October, Resident Evil, Mario Kart Wii next year, Metroid Prime: Corruption (which is out already), and even a Mario and Sonic Olympic game (which looks good), there are games that can satisfy even a college guy.  There's also Madden 08.  It's nice to see that you basically do the action that the character is doing.

The good thing about the Wii is that the online feature is free.  More and more games are going to be coming out for online play, through WiFi connection.  Guitar Hero III, Smash Brothers, Pokemon, Mario Strikers Charged, and others in the future.  Though I liked Xbox Live, the Wii's online will only improve with games in the future, and if you don't have to spend money on that, then the better.

Overall, the system is good for anybody, new or experienced at video games.  It's simple to get used to, and yet brings difficulty to people who want a challenge.  Get into the game!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_211?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=211&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I read in a magazine about that Reggie guy, everything he gets his hand behind turns to gold. And looks like he's struck gold again.

Anyway, the Wii is so much fun. The Wiimote is so resposive. Like seriously responsive. I was playing the golf game at a friends house and I was testing each position of my backstroke from pointing down, diagonal, all the way up to the top and it followed my movements perfectly. It's like having those lights on you to capture your movements.

The real reason I'm most happy about the Wii is because this system will make me buy games I never thought I would ever buy. Like I am really looking forward to a Tiger Woods title. And golf bores me. Well watching it. I'm not really into first shooters either, but I'm very much looking forward to the Metroid games and other shooters.

It may take a while for developers to make games that really fit the Wii, but I have high hopes for this system.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_210?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=210&reviewerType=all_reviews"

While it's generally fine in terms of library and certainly did well in sales, I think it may be one of the worst consoles ever made from a hardware design and implementation standpoint. At the very least, if I made a list of successful video game consoles and handhelds, the Wii would most certainly be the worst of the bunch.

Its primary problem is very simply the control. Broken controls happen in games, but in a Wii game, it's basically guaranteed. The only Wii games that have decent controls are the games that use a standard, non-Wii control scheme. Of course, even those games are hindered by the easily discernible delay between input and response, a problem the 360 never had. To top that all off, I've always had problems with the battery pack on the back of the Wii-motes coming loose and disabling the controller. Other controllers have had this problem too, but none that I have noticed are as poor as the Wii-mote; one wonders why the battery packs cannot be encased in a rigid plastic shell to prevent this kind of thing.

In hindsight, it is actually kind of amazing that a 1-star console like the Wii did so well. It really should be used in video game and hardware design courses as an example of misguided design but very successful marketing.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_246?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=246&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Finally, a system that involves movement!  The sports game that comes with the system is loads of fun for everyone in our family.  We also have Zelda (I highly recommend), Call of Duty 3 (took my son a little while to get used to the controls, but he loves it), and Madden 07 (he just started that one).

Before the Wii came out, my son was asking for an Xbox 360 and I had a big problem spending so much money on a system for nothing much more than better graphics.  The Wii was inexpensive, completely different, and loads of fun.

I've played Zelda, sports, and wario ware, and all of them are great fun and entirely fresh gaming experiences.  The remote is truly awesome, and swinging Link's sword or my baseball bat or golf club are all really sensitive and rewarding.

My wife, who only enjoys puzzle games, can play wii sports for hours at a time and truly enjoys Zelda!  Indeed, I suspect that a great many ""non-gamers"" are going to get addicted to the game play here.  My friend played boxing so long, he broke a sweat and his arms hurt the next day.  No more couch potato gaming with wii sports.  There are more fun titles at launch then there were for the 360 or the PS3, and its price point can't be beat.

A lot of the ""channels"" and online stuff are great fun, too.  The beta version of the web browser bring a farily functinal net browser to my HDTV (I watched youtube videos on it for about an hour the other day).  I've had nothing but trouble getting my 360 to work with my router, but the Wii has been trouble free.  The online weather and news channels are great.  The photo channel is cool and can even play .mov videos.  The Mii channel is kind of fun because as you create little ""Mii"" characters, they begin to populate the games you play.  It's just a nice touch.

Also, I have to rave for a second about their true backwards compatability with the Game Cube (memory cards, disks, even joysticks).  I'm visiting Resident Evil 4 in high def now.  If you never had a cube, this is a great way to explore the library.  I also have to thank Nintendo for using a standard scan disk memory card for the memory.  You can pull one out of your pda, phone, or camera and save $50 for a system-only memory card.

The one downside I have is that you have to upgrade to high def and buy a component cable on your own.  Then again, anyone shopping for graphics should look at the other two systems and get over it.  (If you do buy a component cable, but the mad catz, it's only $20 on Amazon, and it works great!)

I'm not going to go in to any great depth here (there are plenty of lengthy reviews abounding about the wii, just scroll down).  I just want to add my 5 star rating to the mob. If you can find one, this is a superb system.  It's small, it doesn't overheat, and you're going to have some truly unique gaming experiences with this one (and Mario isn't even out yet!).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_193?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=193&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My guess is that new games for the Wii will have the ability to use the remote add-on to it's full advantage. While the graphics are not true HD, you can purchase a component cable for the Wii console which will give you a screen resolution of 420p. Other games, such as Blazing Angels, play well and graphically are excellent with the component cable.

The vast majority of the games are made for people under the age of 7. This is not bad if you are looking for a family console but it only does just that. When we got our wii several of the games we got with it didn't work well, not that the games were broken but they were unresponsive even after we adjusted the receiver. It is very hard to play shooter games because of the way the controls are made, like in Call of Duty: World at War, you have to press down B and twist counter-clockwise to throw a fragment grenade. Because you are twisting it is impossible to aim and therefore nearly impossible to use (Whenever I try the grenade ends up blowing my squad to pieces). It is also harder to snipe than on other consoles. Half the time in the middle of an online match you will move to try and find your enemy and it will spazz out for 3-6 seconds, enough time to get shot. If you are going to play shooter games get something else (I play MOH on my gamecube more). Mario Cart however is good. it is great for parties and fun to play contact racing where you can push the person sitting next to you. Sometimes the controller wants you to go another way and no matter how you turn you will go straight into a wall. Wii play is also pretty fun, but I only play tanks, cow racing, target practice, and the fishing game. Im am actually saving to buy an xbox 360 because of better games and graphics. If Your looking for young person/entire family entertainment look no further, but if you want to play shooter games, get an xbox or ps3.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_276?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=276&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have a feeling all those negative reviews are from individuals being paid by Billy Gates, since in every single field that Microsoft it's involved shows lack of creativity, to put together a box with top of the line video cards, it's not new, you are just taking advantage of today's standars, while the Wii have change the enjoyment of playing this totally replace board games, something it was hard to from the collective experience, i don't need top of the line graphics to have fun, and the quality of the games is totally up to the developers, the potential of the Wii rest on that, if you want a shooting experience looking at pretty pictures buy the Xbox, if you want to have fun and share a good time with family and friends or by yourself get a Wii.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_219?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=219&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was first planning on getting a PS3 since I have a Sony PS2, but the rediculous and outrageous price deterred me, so I thought I would look at the Wii a little closer, and became intrigued with the new controller and all of its possibilities(not to mention the much cheaper price!)so I decided to go with a Wii.

This system blew all of my high expectations away. The graphics are pretty good, not PS3 caliber, but not shabby, either-and they will only get better, since basically all of the games available right now for the Wii were made for the graphically inferior gamecube, or didn't have much time in development to ""polish up"" and fully utilize the wii's new hardware. In my opinion, when you are having as much fun as we are with this system, who cares if the graphics aren't so awesome that you could see the blood vessels in Link or Mario's eyes? My point is,you don't stop to notice the graphics when you are having this much fun playing. I've played a lot of horrible games with awesome graphics, and a lot of great games with mediocre graphics.

It was a breeze to set up, everything seems to have a quality feel to them,(the Wii is a beautiful machine!)and once you get over a relatively painless learning curve, the games are a blast. Wii sports does not have mind-blowing visuals, it was meant to be fun-which it does quite well. My 45 yr. old parents were hooked after a few minutes of bowling, I haven't seen them have this much fun with videogames since Super Mario back in the eighties! This system has been a hit with everyone it has encountered-and with the price, innovation,past and present game lineup, Nintendo quality,and the all-out fun factor-the Wii makes an extremely strong case for your purchase. You won't regret it. It is truly a fresh and welcome gaming revolution.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I got it recently, at Target. But don't go looking there- when i was there, there were only 5 Wiis left! They even had them at retail price: $[...]! (Yes, the Wii is supposed to be $[...] in America, no more, no less.)
Anyway, the Wii is great! It's a game that really gets you up on your feet, really moving, instead of sitting on the couch all day as previous systems did! It even does more than just play games- it lets you make your own little virtual person (called a Mii), edit photos, check the weather, update on the news, and download games from N64, SNES, NES, and I think some Sega systems, too.
Although, if you buy games for excellent, mind-blowing graphics, don't even look in the Wii's direction. Not that the graphics are bad, but... they aren't great, either. But trust me, if you like playing games on your feet, you probably won't care about graphics that much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_200?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=200&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've seen the graphics, etc. offered by the PS3 and 360, but they don't offer the interactivity that the Wii does.  I'm married and have two children still at home (5 and 3) and we all enjoy playing the various games.  We also own the Wii Fit Balance Board, so that adds another level of fun and interactivity.  Our favorite games are Baseball (it's so easy, my little ones can play), bowling (very realistic and just a frustrating as the real game!), ""Ski Jump"" (one of the balance games on the Wii Fit DVD) and ""Soccer Header"" (where you ""head"" soccer balls and avoid cleats and panda heads...don't ask, but it's hilarious!).  Even my 20 year old son joins in the fun when he stops by.  We end up laughing and having quality family time every time we turn it on.  My 5 year old is often upset when it is time to turn it off.  I highly recommend this system for any family looking for clean family fun that gets you off the couch.  Also, pick up the Wii Fit with Balance Board to add another level of fun and interactivity.  It's also great if you want to do a ""real"" workout (the push-up activity is a killer!).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The unit came in a nice compact packing. The unit itself is sleek,  stylish, compact and portable. Took 10 minutes to set it up to my LCD monitor. I loaded the complimentary games CD that arrived with it. It has 5 games : Bowling, Golf, Boxing, Lawn Tennis, Baseball
The only reason I returned it is due to making my brain getting used to a VIRTUAL gaming console. The response times were nowhere realistic. The only game I kind of felt OK was Bowling. It was hard to adjust to other games.
Other Wii specific gripes:
1- No DVD or Music Playing capability
2- No HDMI
3- No Disk Storage
I cannot imagine what catches the fancy of so many million users of Virtual Gaming Consoles for Real Sports like Bowling, Golf, Soccer etc. There is no way they can ever emulate the real world conditions, feel, response times etc. Probably this unit (or any other gaming console) is good for other games that one cannot do in real life for [...] ex: sit in a room and shoot people in war, race in lamborghinis, sing along etc. Also, i think real fun of these gaming consoles is in groups or parties rather than sports that doesn't need a group of people like swimming, golf, bowling.
I got caught in the hype owning a Virtual Gaming Console but couldn't adjust my brain to use it for fun. I guess I am becoming a dinosaur and lagging behind in the evolution (if the theory is right..) in this fast changing world of Gaming, Social Networking sites etc. It is becoming a institution like marriage where the only way to engage with others is to become part of that system/institution; otherwise you are not welcome.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_66?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=66&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It is a very compact easy to carry system. It only has 3 cords (which I found convinent!) Wii sports is a video game that comes free with the system, And I would rate it a 5-star review. The only flaw I found with the wii is the wirless wii sensor bar connection. For Example, If you are using the internet channel, (which you can buy at the wii shop channel) The hand cursor shakes rapidly as you enter your URL (Entry.)If you have an HDTV, You must order a HDMI cord from Nintendo.com. Otherwise, you will have to use a standard AV output/input cord. There are five mini-games on Wii sports: Tennis, Bowling, Golf, Boxing and Baseball. They are all very entertaining! WARNING: There is a wii fitness option on Wii sports. If you play not to there expectations, You will be rated a Wii Fitness Age. EX: You miss two pitches on baseball, You Hit 10 out of 20 Tennis Balls On Tennis, You hit 109 Pins on bowling. Average wii age:...78 How do I know? I Did Exactly That. Same thing goes for Wii Fit When you weigh in and it ""Think's"" You are overweight or even obese, The talking Wii balence board will get mean. (He is located on your TV Screen.)

Lots of laughing is usually involved. We have had the Wii for many months now and the games never seem to get boring. What is great about it is that it can be enjoyed by nearly all ages due to the fact that it can work with minimal effort or you can expend a lot of effort to play the games. I think does a lot for helping develope coordination of hand and eye (and sometimes even feet). It comes with the Sports Game and there are many things you can select to play off of that particular game that will keep you going for a long time. Boxing, Baseball, Bowling, Tennis - all fun. You start by making up your own character (Miis) and this is pretty easy to do. You have all sorts of features to select from to make your character (who will play all these games) look just like yourself.
The system has held up well for us and the controllers are very durable, nothing has broken so far even on one or two occasions where the controller has left a hand and flow across the room (use those wrist straps!) they have continued to work very well. Lots of fun with as much exercise power as you wish to expend on some of the games.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_181?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=181&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Overall, it is a nice console with more promise than real entertainment value. The user interface for the system menus and functions is intuitive. I have fun flailing the Wiimote around; it is a refreshing change from the thumb-wiggling on the Playstation 2, XBox, and Playstation Portable.

However, the Wiimote can be very touchy and it can be quite hard to keep the cursor on the screen, let alone pointed at a specific target. I've gone through all the configuration and calibration menus with no real improvement, and have seen the same problem on friends' Wiis, so I know this isn't a fluke but is a systemic problem. This issue implies that games that do not rely on aiming tend to be much more fun than ones that do. It also means that navigating menus can be a frustrating chore.

I currently own five games: Wii Sports, Wii Play, Red Steel, Metroid Prime 3, and Raving Rabbids. Wii Sports, the game that comes with the Wii console, is a keeper. Notably, almost all the sub-games in Wii Sports don't involve aiming. The Tennis, Golf, and Bowling sub-games are very enjoyable.

Beyond Sports, however, none of the other games are ones I'd consider great, or even above-par. They all suffer from aiming problems and in addition simply don't keep my interest. Compared to titles coming out for the XBox 360 and PS3, they feel very outdated. Even compared to PS2 and XBox games, they're nothing special. Worse still, they're not FUN, and that's what I expect from Wii games. I'm not looking for the storyline of Halo or Half-Life, or the sprawling playground of Grand Theft Auto. I'm just looking for a pleasant diversion, and an excuse to jump and flail around like a fool. The current Wii games that I own don't deliver on that.

I bought most of these games based on glowing 5-star reviews I read on Amazon, and I have to say that the reviews really led me astray. I've rarely had this problem when buying games for the PS2, XBox, or PSP; generally the Amazon reviews of games for these platforms are quite helpful.

I was thinking about buying the latest Mario title, which also gets 5-star reviews, but now I'm wary of spending more money on Wii games without testing them myself first, which means that it will probably be quite a while before I buy another one.

I hope that the game developers figure out how to work with the Wiimote and nunchuk more effectively. I can't help but feel that the basic Wii interface idea is a good one, but it still needs polish.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_176?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=176&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Kooiman","Wii need another controller","February 19, 2007","Back in the late 70's/early 80's when Space Invaders was all the rage, I lived to play video games.  I had an Atari and life was good.  However, the games started getting more and more complicated and less of the mindless entertainment you got from playing Q-Bert and PacMan.  I tried to get interested in the XBOX games.  My kids LOVED them but there were too many different buttons to push and I would quickly get bored.

I bought a Wii for my son's 17th birthday and invited his friends over for a surprise Wii party.  The other kids brought their controllers and in 15 minutes the Wii was set up and they were ready to play.  For games, he had the Sports package that comes with the console, Zelda Twilight Princess and Rampage.  Rampage was the first game tried out and in a few minutes buildings were being smashed and cars tossed through the air.  Video games were fun again!

The controller that comes with the game is easy to hold and quite intuitive.  I was able to bowl (Sports Package) and play tennis like a pro in no time at all.  It was a little challenging to figure out how to get muli-player to work but once it was setup it worked perfectly.  The kids at the Wii party boxed and bowled and played tennis and had a great time.

The only problem with the Wii is availability.  I had to sign up for a service that told me when it was available at local stores and was lucky to be next door to a store when they got 6 units in stock.  I only have one controller right now and am waiting (impatiently) for the stores to get some in stock so more than one family member can play.  Otherwise, we have to invite the ""friends with controllers"" over. :)

If you loved playing in the arcades in the early 80s, buy a Wii and enjoy video games again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_179?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=179&reviewerType=all_reviews"

At my wife's insistence, I bought her a Wii (along with Wii Fit) for our anniversary.  Little did she realize that she would have to wait in line to use it along with her 19 year old daughter and her 57 year old husband.  The whole family is having a blast with it.

I'm actually a pretty hardcore gamer (PS3 all the way!), but, there's something about those endearing little Mii's that get you hooked and keep you coming back.  For the first month that we've had the Wii, we've focused on using Wii Fit, but we may expand into other games in the future.

I'm sure that my wife will agree that it's the best anniversary present that I've ever given her.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Well, they're mostly right and already explain most all of the positive features ad nauseam.

I'll just tell you that I purchased 2 units for Christmas last year for the game room and for the family room.  The kids love it; the games we've played are mostly ""Very Good"" to ""Excellent"".

The units come in handy for family gatherings as well.  Everyone can play the Wii-Sports games and several other party-game titles.  It's the modern version of playing charades.

The other cool feature we like is the Wii acts like a computer.  You connect your Wii to your home's Wi-Fi signal and you can send & receive email, surf the net, send memos, send Wii points as gifts, send & receive photos, as well as participate in Voting Polls (national and international).

It's a seriously fun unit and worth the $250.00.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_191?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=191&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Jordon","Believe it -- this is the best thing to happen to home video games since the Atari 2600","July 27, 2007","For YEARS, my console gaming experience has fundamentally been about sitting around and twiddling my thumbs.

Now, to be fair, I don't have a setup for a steering wheel for my PS2, and I never owned an NES along with its light gun, Power Pad, Power Glove, and whatever else it used.

That's the point, though.  All of those devices were extra.  Game developers can't assume that a console owner is going to own some specific peripheral, so they either had to include one with a game or write the game to handle the standard controller.  So, you ended up either with a bunch of peripheral devices that only worked on a couple games apiece, or you made do with standard controllers.

Because every single Wii comes with the new controller and its do-anything capabilities, developers don't have to worry about creating & selling new hardware of their own.  They can focus instead on trying new things, and they'll know that gamers will get the right experience.

When someone picks up, say, Wii Sports for the first time and play the bowling game, they ask how to put spin on the ball.  I tell them, ""Just spin it,"" and much to their surprise, it works.  Three frames later, they're bowling as easily as they do in real life.  It's just that easy, and it makes that much sense.

Brief rundown of a few of the games I've got:

Wii Sports: It's a keeper.  Work on your backspin & topspin in Tennis, score 300 in Bowling, etc.  It's got a lot of depth, and it relies on your skills as a player.

Resident Evil 4 - Wii Edition:  Holy cow.  Aim, shoot, aim, shoot.  It's much faster and more accurate than wiggling conventional controller sticks.  Playing a RE game on any other console just doesn't make sense anymore.  If you're a fan AT ALL of the RE franchise, and even if you already have this game for the Gamecube or PS2, get the Wii version; you'll never touch the older versions again.

Wario Ware - Smooth Moves:  A lot of story & dialogue -- a lot more than gameplay -- but it really is a kick.  So many of the tasks are so silly that you'll laugh out loud, even while playing alone.

The Godfather: Yes.  Yes, yes, yes.  If this is indicative of where Grand Theft Auto-style gaming is going, we're in for a treat.  The first time I engaged in an in-game fight (as opposed to a tutorial), I reflexively started pressing buttons.  After a couple seconds, I remembered to just punch with the controller, and my character started beating up on the guy.  Bingo; that's how it should be done.  Grab a guy by his collar and throw him against a wall; grab him again and start punching him in the face... it's so much more satisfying to use hand motions than mere button combinations.

Need For Speed Carbon: I got this one strictly as an experiment -- I have it for the PS2, and I wanted to see what the new control scheme is really like while playing a game I already know.  I have to say that it's very, very nice.  Again, I don't have a wheel for the PS2; but after a few minutes of getting used to the steering response of the Wii controller, it makes an awful lot of sense.  Mid-corner corrections respond well, countersteering works, on and on and on.  Despite not having force feedback like a conventional wheel controller, it becomes second nature, and it's easy to ""steer where you look"", as they say in car racing.  Plus, because no extra attachments are needed (although an inexpensive clip-on wheel is nice to have) and you don't have to bolt anything to a table or sit on a wheel base, it's very, very convenient.

Trauma Center - Second Opinion: Definitely a niche game, but it's gotten reviews that favor it versus the original Trauma Center for the DS, and it's quite a lot of fun.  You really start to feel the pressure as you work to save patients, and the Wii controller is perfect for the job.

The Legend Of Zelda - Twilight Princess:  Get it.  Wonderful game.  If you're a Zelda fan, you already know that this is one of the best ever; if you're not a fan, this one just might win you over.

BOTTOM LINE:  This is it, the next big thing in home video games.  It's still out of stock everywhere because it really is that good.  Expect even better things to come along as the online network gets underway and game developers refine their use of the controller.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_210?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=210&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Thompson","Innovative & fun.","December 30, 2007","The Wii certainly lags behind the other current-generation consoles in graphics capabilities, but surpasses them in the simple enjoyability of the game play.  Getting to play one at my in-laws' house is what brought me back to console gaming after 13 or 14 years (I went exclusively to PC games after the Sega Genesis era).  Surprisingly, the Wii Sports games that come with the console are still among the best games for the Wii that I've played.  The ""fun"" factor is outstanding for the Wii, especially if you have other people around to play with.  The ability to download old cartridge games via Virtual Console is also a big plus.

My greatest complaint with the Wii is not with the system, but the games available for it.  I wish that more games made better use of the excellent motion-sensing capabilities of the Wii remote (as opposed to, say, multi-platform games where the remote functions get shoehorned in after the fact); there are too many games -- including very good ones like Super Paper Mario -- where you mostly end up using the remote turned sideways just like an old-fashioned console controller.  Also (and I realize this is not an issue for 98% of gamers), I wish that there were not so many games that require the use of both the Wiimote and the nunchuk -- I have limited use of my left hand, so I can't play most of these.  I mention that mainly because marketing for the Wii focused largely on the use of the remote, its simplicity & accessibility to non-gamers, but the need to use the nunchuk needlessly complicates things.  Greater ability in games to re-map functions to different buttons would also be a plus.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

With the time passed, is it worth the money to invest in one?  Brand new--NO.  I would say, just based off of what is in the box, it is worth 30 dollars.  Compared to it's peers, hardware specs alone, it is inferior.  I understand that Nintendo is in the business to make money and that Nintendo is catering to a specific niche of players:  casual.  Setting up the console is a pain if you can't download the latest patch, that is needed to access the Wii Store.  As an individual that is tech savvy, it is annoying in how this machine doesn't have LAN built in!  Yes, a LAN adapter is around 10 dollars, but why do I need to buy a LAN adapter when having it built into the console is standard with Sony and Microsoft.

If you're interested in playing retro games just use an emulator.  1st party games have always been great for Nintendo, but the gold standard ones are few and rare.  3rd party support is here, but for triple A games?  Rare.  Pay the extra money and get either a PS3 or Xbox 360.  You're not missing much with the little machine that Nintendon't.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_174?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=174&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It is not always easy to attend with the challenge of fitting the workout into our busy work schedule, machines that are not always available at the times we go, and with today's economy it is hard to afford the membership fees. On top of that, my husband is into boxing and not many gyms have equipment to satisfy that.

My husband and I are both gamers and would rather play than suffer through watching the timer on a workout machine. As for the gym equipment, my husband desires boxing, I've pulled or overworked muscles many times, and with an added foot injury I require minimal impact movements as well. So we decided to try out the Wii. My husband can box using the controllers and simply move his arms as if throwing a punch or a jab. As for me, I can play tennis, baseball, bowling, and even golf with appropriate motions for each.

With the Wii, my husband and I can play games TOGETHER while having a workout snuck in as well. All our needs are satisfied and believe me, you will feel it the next day if you really get into it! (I have a few friends who have shed pounds while playing!)

This game console is excellent for parents with lazy kids, and for those who hate to exercise, or like me, would rather just play!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_207?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=207&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Monick","Wow!","June 23, 2007","I have to admit, I was Skeptical Joe when Nintendo first released this system.  A controller with just 2 main buttons?  Pshaw.  You could never build a system on just motion sensing controls!

Well, I was certainly wrong.  After waiting in line for 5 hours at my local Gamestop, a shipment of Wiis arrived and I took mine home.  I opened it up, put in Wii Sports (bundled with the console) and was amazed at just how spectacular this system is.

Firstly, an overview of the system seems appropriate.  The Wii is the Ugly Duckling of the three new next gen systems; it's graphics are fairly bad, but after a while you realize just how awesome it is.  The opening menu after turning on the system has 6 elements.  One takes you to the game you put in, GC or Wii.  The second is the ""Mii"" channel, which lets you design characters for fun and for use in the games.  My younger sister loves this channel, and it is in fact greatly entertaining.  The third channel is the photo channel, which I have not yet used because the Wii only takes SD memory cards.  The fourth channel is the Virtual Console channel, which shares a lot of parallels with the iTunes store: you buy a card at the store, click and download for a fee.  I haven't yet downloaded a game, but have heard good things from friends.  The fifth and sixth channels are the News and Forecast channels.  The news channels alerts you to top global and local (you type in your zip code) stories.  The forecast channel shows you not only the weather predictions for your area but anywhere on the globe.  Both are very easy and quick to use.

The Wii has excellent game play, despite the prejudice that it would only produce novelty games.  Hence far my favorite is Super Paper Mario, a sequel to the popular games featured on N64 and GameCube.  My favorite that uses the motion sensing controls is Mario Party 8.  While retaining similarities from its seven predecessors, it integrates new facets of the Wii experience very enjoyably.

If I were to give one warning about the Wii, it would be to stay away from this console if you dislike moving during your video games.  For example, during the Mini-Games in Mario Party often times you find yourself standing up so you can better take advantage of movement.  One game involves shaking your arm as fast as you can for a good 10 seconds.  It defies the traditional image of slothfulness as a factor in video games, but if you're an old fashioned button-presser and the only thing you like to move while playing is your thumb, I would not recommend the Wii to you.

The Wii countered and changed the standards of video gaming when no one expected that it could.  Nintendo did the same thing with the DS a few years ago, and it's a similar revolutionary gaming experience when you pick up the Wii remote for the first time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_229?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=229&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I love my 360 and when Halo 3 comes out I dont expect to be touching anything else for quite sometime. I picked up the Wii system on a trip to NYC just because they had them available at the Nintendo store, and I had read a lot of positive reviews. I still love my 360 but I am in pure 100% high school puppy dog love with the Wii...and so is my wife!! This thing makes the living room a blast for families and guests and has some extremely handy functionality right out of the box like weather reports and customizable news. You will really enjoy making your Mii's (funny little characters that you can make look like anyone in the world, and use in games) and the controls are absolutely fantastic. If you have the $, I highly suggest getting one. This thing is amazing fun and very nonobtrusive. Itll look great on a shelf with your wallmounted LCD or Plasma hiding all the wires.

So it's still new to me.  The main things I like about this console are:

*Reliability.  You don't hear much about Console failures (360's Red ring of Death)

*Virtual Console.  I'm a big fan of games from the 90's.  So being able to download NES,SNES, & Genesis games is awesome.  Although they need to increase the library, it's not very expansive.  But I hear they're going to be adding Chrono Trigger in 2011! :-D

*Netflix.  Being able to stream movies through the Wii to the TV is great!  The picture quality is a lot better than i would have expected.  It looks flawless to me.  (BTW..I do own a PS3 ...and the picture quality & main page Layout are inferior compared to Wii)

*Exclusive Titles.  I know PS3 & 360 outdue the wii by far with their variety of games.  But like i said before, i love the 90's games....so to be able to play games like Mario Galaxy, DKC Returns, kirby, ect is great.

Glad i purchased the system.  My only complaint really is that the Virtual Console needs a lot more titles.  They're missing out on some easy revenue by keeping it limited to where it's at.  They'd bring in TONS of dough by releasing Earthbound alone!

At the moment it's kind of collecting dust but I thought I would write a review because it's a lot of fun to play with friends and family and the games are pretty cool.  I like the fact that I can download older games as well.  I can only give it 4 stars though because sometimes it has issues connecting to my high speed internet and carrying out its downloads.  Also, the screen looks a little streched out with camecube and downloaded games since I have a widescreen TV, you would think that because most people have HD now that the software and hardware would be tailored for these types TVs.  Perhaps that will be the next step.  Also, the fact that this does not double as a DVD player is a negative, but overall it's a great system with fun games coming out all the time.

The Big Wheel, Barbie, Rubix Cube, The Whiffle Ball.  Nintendo Wii is one of these toys.  It's the best video game ever made for kids.

No violence.
Easy to play.
Great colorful graphics.
Remotes that you have to swing and jump around with, getting a bit of exercise on winter days.

No the people don't look real, but the genius of the Wii programmers is that they don't attempt to.  On other video units like Xbox or Playstation, those attempts just create creepy looking dummies.  Wii knows it's just a game for kids and like Twister, has fun with the kitsch.

I don't like video games and would rather everyone be outside. But in January or pouring rain, when the homework is done and the books are read, I feel ok with breaking out some wii.  We all jump around and actually can work up a bit of a sweat - as opposed to sitting on the floor with control pads.  Also some of the Mario games have so many levels, it could take years to get to them all.  The creativity of the designers is incredible.

It has wifi where you can play people online with certain games, but there's no interaction between the players which I like.  It's simply playing them.  I lose almost every time.

I'm not much of a console game person -- I tend to like the PC games more than the Playstations and XBoxes of the world -- but when I got the Wii as a gift, I was surprised by how fun it is.

The system comes with one remote, a nunchuck, and WiiSports. When I read the review in a PC Magazine of John Dvorak -- a noted curmudgeon -- loving this system, I was intrigued. I got the system as a gift, and I told my mom who is an avid bowler how Dvorak mentioned that the system does an honest representation of Bowling. We played it this weekend, and the whole family, from ages 6 to 87, bowled on this thing. We had a great time! The great part is that we did this in the living room, and there were no sixteen-pound balls to lug around, so we were able to play again and again.

I cannot emphasize how much fun this is. And when Mario Party comes out for it, let the games begin!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_229?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=229&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's an ok system if you don't play games that often. That is due to the fact of not a large selection of good games. Most of the games are aimed for kids not yet in the 4th grade. I'm not saying thats bad but if your looking for more mature games I would go with a PS3 or an Xbox 360. The wii does not support HDTV which makes it look like crap on a HDTV. I think that Nintendo need to some rethinking.

The party games are good fun and you feel like you're doing more than just 'sitting on the couch working on your a@@ impression.'
In terms of all the new platforms (xBox 360 and PS3) it is the most affordable of the three.  Plus, you get so much included - a hard drive (don't have to fork out more $$) and a wireless antennae built-in (a[...] add-on for the other platforms).

Bach","The Best Seventh Generation Console","April 25, 2009","As someone who has had some experience with the 360, PS3, and Wii, I truly think the Wii is the better system. It's graphics are understandably not as good as the other two consoles but not to the extent that it becomes an issue. While the library was a little limited at first I think it has grown to encompass all sorts of genres, not just the kiddy stuff that is often sterotyped. The bottom line is that when I have friends over we play the Wii over the Xbox every time. Sure some of the games and accessories are gimmicky but anyone with any sense is able to bypass those for decent games and quality accessories, I love using the Mario Kart wheel and the Zapper. Using analog sticks to aim weapons now seems silly to me.

If you're looking to only play first person shooters online constantly than the Wii is obviously not for you. If you want something that will provide plenty of fun and a new video game experience, give it a shot. It is completely worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_225?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=225&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pickman","Nintendo always falls just a LITTLE short.","October 16, 2008","No one will probably even make it to this review, but here it is. Nintendo has, bar none, the most addictive and enjoyable first party and second party titles in the video gaming industry. With the Wii they changed the way we played games and I give them the utmost respect and thanks for that.

 The problem is two fold:
 First, the gaming industry isn't ready for this kind of innovation. By that I mean, gaming companies find it easier and more economical to follow the same gaming model rather than taking the trouble to code in full motion control for 1 out of 3 consoles.

The second problem is that Nintendo always shoots themselves in the foot by leaving out integral elements of their consoles. The first of which is a lack of hard drive. Part of the primary appeal of the wii is the Virtual Console and Wii Shop Channel. Downloading games takes up memory however, and a 2GB expansion card isn't enough for most. If they can fit a 160GB drive in an iPod, they should be able to fit at least a 20GB drive in a Wii.
The second issue is opting not to include a chipset with the same graphical capabilities of their competitors. So not only is the control scheme more difficult to code, but developers have to make a second version of the game with lower poly counts, smaller texture maps, and dumbed down physics engines. These together make 90% of the developers completely overlook the console because they can still generate significant revenue developing for the other two consoles.

This also forces consumers to have to buy the 360, the PS3, or both so they can have access to the games available for everything but the Wii. The Wii had the potential to be the greatest system of this generation, but a couple bad decisions left it a little short.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Positive+
-It is fun and the remote works well.

-It's got alot of fun features like the Internet channel and Wii shop.

-You can buy old games (NES, SNES, N64, Genisis, ect)on the wii shop channel. (need wi-fi connection and wii points)

-Games are fun and work well with the Wii remote and nunchuck.

- ECT.

Negitive -
-It's a pain to put a GameCube controller on because the ports are on the top of the Wii, so to avoid knocking over the Wii I turn it on its side, but it just suks. So I got a wireless gamecube controller and they work very well!

-When you first get it, it's kind of confusing on how to sync the Wii Remotes but once you do then you have to get the settings on the Wii to make your remote show up on the screen and that takes a while.

-It takes a while for it to turn off. But that's not the big proplem, if you have Wi-Fi. When it's on the light is Green, when it's off it's red. But if you have Wi-Fi the off color is yellow-orange. It's hard to tell if the light is green or yellow, so I have to wait by the Wii and watch the Wii to see if the color is yellow or green.

I don't know if this helped but these are my + and -.

I also recommend that you buy Wii Play because 1: you get a second Wii remote, 2: you get the game Wii Play which can really help you get used to the Wii Remote and it's fun with 2 people!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_183?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=183&reviewerType=all_reviews"

As far as I'm concerned they own the 4 best gaming series in platforming history (3 being exclusive to Nintendo) Mario, Metroid, Resident Evil and Zelda. Unlike movie sequels they continue to improve and evole with the series. Although, it's tough to beat Super Nintendo's ""Link to the Past"" or ""The Ocarina of Time"" as 2 of the best games ever made.

The shooters are fine, but I get that stuff on my PC, it's the big 4 that keep me coming back to Nintendo for 15 years and 5 consoles. The thing that a lot of Nintendo detractors point out is the processor speed isn't quite as fast as the Xbox or PS3, but it's the quality of their games that make me very happy.

I have a Grandmother and Grandfather who are totally against video games but they LOVE this! Create your own Mii Play one of 5 Wii Sports- Tennis, Baseball, Bowling, Golf, Boxing(If you want to Verse someone you need a 2nd Nunchuk).

This is the best family entertainment I have ever experienced, for the time that Nintendo Wii has been out they have created a lot of games. I only wish they would come in different colors, probably within the next 2 years they will have a good 5-8 colors to buy. I really like to play Mario Kart Wii if anyone is up to playing, I also like to play Super Smash Bros. Brawl.

I hope you can find a Nintendo Wii, don't let this one go, this is one of the best gaming systems out there.

Be sure to pick up a few extra controllers.

If you are trying to understand why the Wii is so amazing even though is it's graphics are not up to par with the other next gen consoles... it's because the Wii sucks you into the game not by visual looks but by tactile feedback with the remote control... it's the combination of the rumble and the built in speaker in the controller that makes this machine such a joy to use.

For instance if you are playing baseball and you swing your arms to hit the ball with the bat... it's the combination of seeing the player swing the bat on the screen and the satisfying clack of the bat with a slight brrr in your hand that makes you feel like you really did hit that ball.  It's a simple thing but it makes a huge diference... Sony actually dropped the rumble technology in it's PS3 even though it was standard in it's PS2.  This has been a major complaint of the system!

 So you can't look at the graphics and judge this system... you have to hold the controller and once you do then you will understand the almost cult status of this system! Initially there were very few good games for the Wii fortunately game developers are now catching on to this and creating games that tap into the unique Wii controller system.  I can't wait for the Star Wars game that is being made specifically for the Wii system... multi system games can be a real hit or miss for the Wii.  The only shame about this system is that you can't just walk into a store to buy it... you have pay extra ordinary marked up prices which show no signs of changing for this year.  Nintendo really should be ashamed and criticized for allowing this to happen, but they should be praised for realizing that us humans can not only play games with our eyes and fingers but with out full nervous system... hopefully the other manufactures will realize the error of the ways and start adding more tactile feedback to gaming.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_190?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=190&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Nintendo has most certainly filled the gap between the normal genre of people who play games to literally ALL age groups.

When the time to buy came, I researched and decided on a Wii.  It exceeded anything I could have expected.  The two points which sold me are 1) you have to get up off the couch and get active to play and 2) the focus isn't so much on violence, blood and killing.  I'm a senior citizen and my daughter picked this up for me.  We played it until our arms were numb and she is looking to get her own Wii so we can play on-line.  I check the daily weather and news stories on my Wii and my friends and I will soon start a bowling league.  For the price, you can't beat this system.  If I were paying 50 cents for every game I played, it would have paid for itself in a month or two.  The software selection is great and the prices are reasonable.

Meyer","Truly a great system","January 22, 2008","It is hard to express how this compares to systems like PS3 and Xbox360.  The dual-analog controlled systems are MILES away from what the Wii puts out there.  I am not saying that the Wii is better, but what it does is truly unique.

There have been plenty of reviews about gameplay already; I don't know that I can add anything to that.  However, what I can do is talk about what this system does differently to encourage multi-player gaming.

People love to make fools of themselves and they love to compete.  By combining these two aspects, the Wii gets people to move as well.  For instance, I was playing the Mario and Sonic at the Olympics game by myself after renting it.  My wife came in to the room while I was engaged in a heated round of fencing with Bowser.  She thought that it was pretty cool and wanted to play.  That, my friends, is what hell freezing over is all about.

Many games require minimal use of buttons.  In the same game, my wife was dumbfounded that she could participate in the long jump without hitting a single button.  This makes the system accessible to younger siblings and older parents/grandparents.  For those of you who don't know about the long jump controls, you alternately shake the remotes up and down (a la playing a drum) to run; depending on how fast you ""drum,"" you run faster or slower.  To jump, you lift up the remote right as your character hits the take-off line.

Finally, the great equalizer...bowling.  I have yet to find someone who doesn't enjoy a good game of Wii bowling.  Grandmas play, 4 year olds play, corporate goons play (at our annual meeting for a Fortune 500 company they had 40 flatscreens with Wiis lined up in one of the entertainment areas; they had the longest wait).

This is a great family system.  If you want flawless graphics for over $600, get a PS3 and some games.  If you want to have a good time playing you system and not break the bank, but a Wii.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_215?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=215&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Nintendo actually went for something new. The new control scheme is much more advanced than powerful CPU and GPU. It reminds me of the song, ""Razzle Dazzle"" from the musical ""Chicago."" ""Razzle dazzle 'em
And they'll never catch wise!"" is a perfect analogy for what Microsoft and Sony have done with their systems. At least Microsoft added other media functions to attract people to its system even though that doesn't qualify any more to be considered next-gen. Sony on the other hand, copy features from both of its competitors and still only has a half baked system.

Nintendo has no stake in anything but gaming, so they actually focused on gaming when the Wii was in R&D. They did put motion, force-feedback, and traditional buttons on its controller and it does work great. Sure, the graphics aren't the greatest but I was warned well in advance, even before the system came out that it would only be slightly better than the GameCube. So don't listen to people complaining about the graphics when they already knew what they were going to be like. The lower graphics does allow games to be easily put on a single disk. I thought the graphics on the GameCube were fine, so the slight increase pleases me. And, because the games aren't too graphically intense, Nintendo just needed to use full-sized DVDs, which can be read much faster than Blu-Ray discs, so performance is not sacrificed like on the PS3.

As for the limited number of games, for me it's not as bad for the Wii as the 360 or the PS3. There are more games for the Wii that I want to play than there are for the 360 or the PS3. I'm rather picky when it comes to the games I'll buy, so right now there are only two out for the Wii that I want with a third coming out in June. But there's only 1 or 2 for the 360 that I would want and none for the PS3, so it's not like I didn't consider games when I bought the Wii.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_206?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=206&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've loved video games since childhood.  I had the Pong which I think came out in the late '70s, Intellivision, Sega Genesis, Sega Saturn and loads of games for my PC.  I sort of tired of console games after a while due to the cords and the fact that I couldn't play them while sitting up in my bed.  Even when wireless capability came out, I felt that PC games were more my style.  Over the past few years, I've had issues with PC games mostly due to recurring problems with my PCs. I currently have four PCs with only two functional at present.  Neither is capable of handling games more complex that those that can be downloaded from various game websites; thus, I've been anxiously waiting to get my hands on a Wii for over a year.  One day last week, I happened to notice that Amazon had them in stock and immediately made my purchase.  It arrived last Wednesday and I'm over the moon about it.  My mom, who lives with me due to health problems and is homebound, loves it too.  I think it may be just the thing to get her up and moving.  She was simply amazed to learn that she could access the internet from the Wii.  I've already loaded her usual websites into the ""Favorites"" so now she doesn't have to use her laptop since the Wii webpages can be manipulated into a much larger text size than the laptop.  She also loves the way the ""Weather"" Channel allows you to manipulate the terrain just like the TV Weather-man with their Doppler 4000s.

Personally, I am impressed with the Shopping Channel and the ability to dowload WiiWare.  This will give me access to cool games made exclusively for the Wii without leaving my house or waiting for something to arrive in the mail.  Although the WiiSports game that came with the console is enjoyable, sports aren't one of my favorite game genres.  I do really like tennis and boxing.  I haven't been an active tennis player since my youth but I find that my old strokes and body positions can be successfully employed with the Wii.  With a little more practice using WiiSports, I might be able to handle a real court and publich scrutiny by next Summer.  Boxing is a good upper body work-out and I'm hoping it will help tone my arms and waistline.

By now, most stores have sold out of their very limited inventory of Wii systems. This is unfortunate for all those parents searching for the system; however, all is not lost.  My local grocery store was actually selling them and had two left in stock.  This is the last place I would have thought you could buy a Wii system but obviously  was wrong.  The Wii is the best thing since sliced bread.  If you're still searching for one, please don't give up.  Even if you don't manage to get one until after the holidays, you'll discover that it was worth the wait.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's sold out everywhere.  Grannies are playing Wii Sports in nursing homes because it's so easy to pick up and play.  But here's what you won't hear -- the Wii is a pitifully outdated piece of junk with one major gimmick (the motion control).  I'd like to see follow-up news stories about the grannies to see whether they still turn the thing on.  I know that mine now mostly collects dust, as do most other Wiis

The defining features of the Wii is its motion control.  Here's the dirty little secret that the fanboys and enthusiastic recent buyers won't tell you: the Wii controls are terrible.  I have played through a lot of games, ranging from the AAA titles like Mario Galaxy and Zelda, to the party games like Mario Party 8 and Wii Sports and I can say this -- motion control is awful.  There is absolutely no precision to it.  If you had dreams of using the Wii-mote realistically like a lightsaber, than forget it. It doesn't facilitate any kind of decent control.  The only game where motion control actually improves the gameplay is Wii Bowling.  In every other game, it's generally an annoyance that is used in gimmicky fashion.  Random button pressing has been replaced with random Wii-mote gesturing.  By the time you have played a game like Zelda or Bully for a few hours, you will be wishing that you could push buttons in lieu of waving your Wii-mote around.  This is why 90% of the software on the Wii is shovelware party games.  This is why the Wii has the lowest ratio of software to hardware sales out of the three major consoles.

Speaking of shovelware, the Wii has by far the worst library of any game console this decade.  Most of what comes out for it is unplayably bad.  There are a few great first party Nintendo titles (which are largely rehashes from prior Nintendo platforms), and a few great third party titles like Bully and Resident Evil 4 that are already available on other systems.  Every multiplatform game that comes out, whether its Madden football, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, Guitar Hero, or a Call of Duty game, puts its worst version on the Wii.  If you don't believe me, then look up the reviews for these games.  The Wii always gets the worst version of every game.  I cannot think of one single exception to this rule.

The reason for the poor Wii software library is that the Wii is nothing mroe than a Gamecube with gimmicky motion controls.  Everything about the technology, like graphics, level size, and loading times, are bad.  The Wii sees none of the recent advances that have improved video games, like realistic physics.  Not only does the Wii not get a good version of multiplatform games, it doesn't get the great games that take advantage of modern technology.  Fallout 3, Grand Theft Auto IV, Mass Effect, Far Cry 2, Dead Space, Left 4 Dead, Assassins Creed, Portal, Half-Life 2.  You cannot play these great games on the Wii.  Want to know why? Because they won't work on the Wii's 2001-esque technology.  You can't get downloadable content for Rock Band on the Wii.  Why? Because it lacks a hard drive.

Two years ago, the price point for the Wii was a major selling point, but now that that PC hardware, the XBox 360, and the PS3 have dropped in price, this is no longer much of an advantage.  You can actually get a barebones XBox 360 for $50 less than a Wii now.

The only people for whom I would recommend this console are:

A:  People with children between the ages of 3 and 10
B:  People who have lots of social gatherings at their house.

The Wii is a good console for children because of the simplicity of the games, and the motion controls do add a certain element of fun when you are playing with other people.  I must say that the times where my in-laws have come over have seen the Wii get a lot of use.  Other than that, not much.  My wife plays the Lego games with me, but you can get that game on other platforms with better graphics.

I bought a Wii about 8 months ago, and I'm thinking about selling it now.  I got some enjoyment out of it, but now I hardly ever turn it on.  The PC provides a much better gaming experience for me, and now I'm considering getting a PS3 or an XBox 360 instead.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_217?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=217&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The motion sensor controllers are so much fun. The overall controls for wii games are pretty easy to pick up and they are addictive! I have been playing for a couple days now, and gameplay never gets boring. One of my friends got a PS3 a few weeks ago, and it's good too. He bought the system, an extra controller a game and an HDMI cable (required for HD gaming, no it's not really HD out of the box), and it cost him about $850-900 dollars. Ouch! The graphics rock, but that's really what you're paying for. Unless you have an HDTV, there is NO reason to get a PS3. I'm not a guy who's big on grpahics though, I care about how much fun it is. I mean I can live with halfway decent graphics.  Most people don't use the PS3 storing movies and whatnot, that's why we have normal computers. I had more fun playing the wii than I did his PS3. The wii also gets internet and you can freely browse all web pages (the PS3 does that). Also, you can buy a wii component cable for 10 bucks for people who have HDTV's, it'll improve the graphics. For anyone who wants an affordable, easy to learn, fun, new console, the wii is for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_191?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=191&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When I finished the homework about 45 min. after turning off the console my roomate and I decided to play Wii bowling. I turned on the console and the start screen came up as usual. When i selected the disc it began as if it were reading the disc and about to start up. However, about 20sec later a black screen with white text came up reading there was an error with the disc reader. After unplugging, resetting, turning off for 5 min, taking the disc out, etc. I tied a differnt disc. Same error. I called Nintendo and they said they would send me a new Wii Sports, but i told them i had tried other games and it didnt work. I did not see the point in having them send me another Wii Sports. Long story short. I enjoyed this $90 game system for exactly an hour before it crapped out.

I love the way that the controllers make every game more interactive.  I've yet to play anything that didn't play better, or was at least more satisfying, when I played it standing on my feet.

And those same controls have already sucked in several family members who wouldn't otherwise dream of playing a video game.  But they all love the Wii.

Definitely, there's been a dearth of decent games (particularly those that really take good advantage of the controller).  But there have been enough to tide me and my Wii-lovin' 5-year-old over until we get some goodies later this year.  My X-mas list is already locked in at a single item: Guitar Hero 3.

If you've got a family, or if you're just tired of the same-old-same-old in console gaming, get yourself a Wii.  You won't regret it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_208?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=208&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was a huge fan of the SNES/NES as a kid. I played those systems all throughout my childhood. The N64 came out when I was about 16, but I never got into what the video game scene became. Video games seemed to become for harcore kids who were really into games and storylines. I never enjoyed games that required such involvement and depended on high quality graphics. Since I used to like to play video games, I loved games that had game PLAY. I really feel many games of recent years focused on new graphics and involvement (thousands of hours, etc.) and forgot about fun.

Then I got the Wii.

I waited a few years because I had long given up on video games. Now, I can't put the thing down. Between Wii Sports and Mario Kart Wii, I am now excited to play video games again. I think Nintendo not only has a hit, but has broken a huge demographic barrier and has created a long term trend. It has once again made video games useable for all ages and people. That's the way to a successful product.

My only dissapointment with the system is lack of a DVD player, but again, watching DVDs on a game system needlessly uses it for something it wasn't designed to do.

If you ever liked video games, buy the Wii. The 1995-2006 demographic of hard core videogamers will be dissapointed. Everyone else will love it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_191?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=191&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It starts, of course, with the user interface. The fact that you move your body to control the game differentiates it from all other gaming systems. But that's just the beginning. The Nintendo Wii is designed for a different kind of gamer. Games for the Wii are often more family-friendly and often they encourage group play. Games like Wii Sport, for example, let you play tennis by yourself or with a friend, and the let you compete to see who can score the highest in bowling. While other gaming systems concentrate on shoot `em ups and role-playing games for serious adult gamers, the Wii system is designed with everyone in mind, young and old.

The Nintendo Wii gaming system is very easy to set up. One small problem we encountered is the unit's tendency to overheat. I highly recommend buying a cooling unit to go with your Nintendo Wii. (We have yet to find a good charging station for the Wii-motes, as they are called. The Wii-motes eat up batteries very quickly, so this would be a great thing to have. The trouble is finding one.)

Of course, a gaming system is nothing without the right games to play on it. A few of our favorites include Wii Fit, Animal Crossing, Karaoke Revolution, Guitar Hero, Lego Indiana Jones, and Raving Rabbits TV Party. Everyone has his or her personal favorite, but we have yet to find anyone who doesn't want to play a game on our Wii: from the kids to the grandparents, and everyone in between.

Of course one of the most incomprehensible things about the Wii, is that the system which is better --for most people--than all the other gaming systems on the market, actually costs less. If you want a gaming system the entire family will enjoy, I recommend the Wii. I think you'll love it as much as we do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_187?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=187&reviewerType=all_reviews"

There's lots of great games on the horizon and this system is the ONLY place you'll find games like Zelda, mario and Metroid. On top of that, with the wii network where you can download hundreds of retro games, it has the largest library of games hands down, so long as you don't have any of the past systems/games that they came out on.

Durham","Man this is fun","December 2, 2006","I'll admit I was skeptical at first, but I have to say that Nintendo's wonderous Wii is a sight to behold.  The motion sensored remote controls may seem gimmicky at first, and even hard to get a hold of for some, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be immersed in some of the most intuitive gaming unlike anything else you've experienced.  And unlike the PS3, the Wii features a bevy of excellent launch titles, and many of them are exclusive to the system.  The Wii includes Wii Sports, which is a great showcase for just what this system is capable of.  The game itself is a nice distraction and a taste of things to come for the system.  Yeah, the graphics aren't mouthwatering like what you see on the XBox 360 or Playstation 3, and it doesn't have all the bells and whistles that the other systems have either, but it's the games that make the system worth owning.  The Wii is compatiable with Gamecube games and controlers, plus it also features the ability to go online to the Wii's ""Virtual Console"" and download classic NES, Super NES, and Nintendo 64 games, as well as Genesis and Turbo-Grafx 16 titles; which in itself is an awesome extra that may rival that of XBox Live Arcade, maybe.  The list of first party games are great, including Excite Truck and of course Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and third party titles like Rayman Raving Rabbids, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, Call of Duty 3, Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz, and Madden '07 all fit in quite well on the Wii.  Upcoming titles like Super Mario Galaxy and the next installment in the Metroid Prime series, make purchasing the Wii all the sweeter, and the ultra affordable price should help seal the deal.  Yes, some people won't get the controls, and many may be turned off by the lack of mature games, but for what it's worth, the Wii is the best thing Nintendo has crafted in a while.  All in all, if you're looking for a next-gen system with a ton of potential, the Wii is a glimpse at what the future of gaming could be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_183?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=183&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Unbelieveable... a true gaming Revolution!","January 4, 2007","I have to say, I am completely speechless on how MUCH FUN the Wii is. When you get the wiimote in your hands and maneuver the pointer on the screen for the first time you suddenly realize that you are in for a nice treat. It just feels so good and natural! When you play shooting games such as Call of Duty 3 or Red Steel, you feel like you are actually pointing and aiming at your enimies; not just pressing buttons! The accuracy of the controls are surprisingly truthful to your movements. If the games right now after launch are pretty good in controls just wait until winter 2007 after game developers have had time to tweek and get the full hang of this new technology. WHOA! Look out for some serious gaming experience!

The included Wii Sports game with the console is a top notch move by Nintendo. True, the game is simple. Yet because of this I was questioning the shrill excitment people are getting when they play the game. I thought to myself ""yeah, I know it must be great to play videogame tennis, baseball, golf, etc in a completely different way but why all the fuss over it""? I didn't understand this untill I actually got my hands on my new Wii and tried the game myself. Whoa! I was completely floored! This title is quite entertaining, in fact it can be the main show of a party by itself! You can have four wiimotes thus four players challenging each other on a 2 by 2 tennis match and much more. Believe me, you will have a good time with this title especially when you ""get the feel"" for the game (you will know this when you start sweating).

The system itself is very quite, almost producing no sound at all except the occational short buzzes of the CD motor.

The ability to create Miis, that is, little customizable characters that you create to portray your character in a game is again simple but remarkable. I love the Virtual Console games that you can download for a small fee. The only downside currently is that if your game system gets defective and you get a replacement you cannot transfer your Virtual Console games to the new system; they die with the broken one. I do hope Nintendo will work a way around this in the near future though.

Overall, I am IN LOVE with the Nintendo Wii for its innovative controlling system, Virtual Console game downloads, ability to create characters to play in certain games, access internet through your existing broadband connection, free internet play, cheap price, and SO much more! I just don't know how Nintendo does it. One thing is for sure; This is the start of a gaming Revolution - an entirely new way to play and view games. Though, does this new revolution bond with the public? Just take a look at  Amazon.com's customer reviews and product rating of the system and you'll get your answer. Soon, Nintendo's competitors will follow this or similar technology but nontheless, the world will still know about the original and legendary company that started it all. Congratulations and best of wishes, Nintendo!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_182?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=182&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's easy to set up and you can be playing in minutes.  The Wii Sports games it comes with are fun to play and can give you quite a workout!  We also purchased an extra controller with the Wii Play package, and the controller recharging station (highly recommend both).  CAUTION when buying additonal games.  Shortly after getting our Wii we purchased the M&M's Go Kart race game.  In a word, it SUCKS.  You can't make the cars turn as described in the instructions and hence the game is virtually unplayable.  Tried to take it back but can't.

Got it for my boy for Christmas and now I hover in the hall waiting for him to start playing so I can grab my remote and join in!  This console is so much fun!  It is refreshingly different playing on a console that doesn't rely on an analog stick and button mashing.  I was concerned the controllers would be awkward and hard to get used to but within ten minutes the boy and I were right at home with it.  The console, so far, seems extremely stable with not a single glitch or freeze-up on any game wii have played.  By the way, if you get a Wii you gotta get Rayman Raving Rabbids!  Yes I'm 42 years old but it's my favorite.  Also, if you get a Wii, go ahead and get an extra set of controllers.

Santa bought this game to get five members of the family off their rearends and playing sitting video games.  It worked to get a disabled member of the family active. It was a great form of physical therapy without it feeling like it.

Since Mom was a kindergarten teacher, if it didn't have an obvious ""learning"" factor, then it wasn't brought into the house and she despised pretty much all electronics including the TV much less games!  So, now many many years later, I finally bought my first game console thinking it'd be more for my husband than for me.  Little did I know that I'd be virtually addicted to it in no time flat!  I love the fact that it's wireless!  Less mess especially from all the spilled drinks and so much safer than tripping over all the cords ... and with no cords draped across the room, my cats aren't drawn to them for chewing.  Yes, my reluctance to get into gaming because all the costs add up is still very real because when you get the base set, you immediately want to buy extra remotes and nunchucks and the charging station and the wheels and the fitness stuff and heaven forbid you forget just the cost of the games alone.  However, it's become so much fun and since it's really rather portable, we've taken it almost everywhere to entertain ourselves, our friends, the kids and anyone else that shows up.  There just seems to be something for everyone!  We even took it to a funeral where there were going to be some rather bored people eventually - we just set it up to the TV they had in the ""Family Room"" & people would pick a game here or there to relieve a little stress!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_180?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=180&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It doesn't have all the technological bells and whistles like true HD capability (it's only 480p), has limited internet access and doesn't play other media like DVDs (but it does play GameCube games). But it is fun.

I like the fact that you need to get up off the couch and play these games. Remember when games meant physical activity instead of sitting on a couch pressing buttons? Well, here's a game console that actually encourages physical activity. If you're a parent that wants to encourage physical activity to your kids, this is the console for you.

There are a few things to note though:
1.If you have a mounted flat screen TV, the included wired Wii sensor will be problematic. The wire won't be long enough to snake through a wall and into your A/V rack. Fortunately, a few companies have like Nyko have produced wireless sensor options. They have it here in Amazon.
2.If you want to get the most out of the Wii in terms of image fidelity for your HDTV you'll need to get component cables. These cables will allow the Wii to send 480p signals to your HDTV. Nintendo didn't bundle component cables with the Wii. You can purchase the Nintendo component cables or you can get third party options. All of which are available for purchase here at Amazon.
3.For all those who are finding it hard to get a Wii, try checking the online and brick and mortar stores on Wednesdays and Thursdays. That's usually when shipments arrive.

Now don't get me wrong. I'm not saying that the PS3 and the XBox 360 don't have their place. Both of those gaming consoles have media center-like capabilities that the Wii can't touch. In the case of the PS3, it's Blu-Ray player. But that isn't the demographic Nintendo was aiming for with this product. It was aiming for the family gaming market. And in THAT market, the Wii excels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_179?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=179&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We had trouble activating a second remote when using some other Wii games (not with the ones that came with the Wii; they make it easy to use another remote).

The gougers who buy these things up and sell them at more than double when they are out of stock everywhere are not getting a penny from me.  It is just a video game, after all.

If and when we all adults end up trying to find ways around healthy fun and family entertainment, I think Nintendo nailed it!

This is a console like no other. We all have busy working and family styles and its no different anymore in this part of the world either. The best thing I like about the pre-tense of this platform is its non-hard-core-gaming affinity for the never really played games crowed category; or complex gaming systems that would drive any new comer to gaming insanity.

I like the simplicity of the game that is included with the machine: WII SPORTS!  Ii had my share of hard core gaming on the PC and PS2. However when I try to play these high end games, I honestly do not have the time or willingness to finish them. The one game I am absolutely looking forward to is Star Wars unleashed!  Which is coming sometime next year I think

Anyhow, fantastic gaming console. Its for anyone new to gaming or reborn into video gaming. Has that old arcade feel to it; especially the simpler games.

WiiSports, Zelda TP, and Trauma Center are incredibly fun.  Zelda is beautiful to look at, no matter what the ""graphical limitations"" of the Wii are.

Secondly, the games I list above make full use of the new control setup.

For the price, the Wii is a remarkable setup.  You might not have the ""flashiness"" of the 360 or PS3, but trust me...having seen all three side-by-side running Madden '07, the graphical difference is more Dreamcast/PS2 than PS1/PS2.

The new graphics for the Wii are a huge step away from the gamecube. The quality of the games and video is purely sweet eye candy. Many people say the the remotes don't work or that the games are all for little kids but that isn't true. All of the games I own (which is a lot) are definently not for kids.
The Wii menu is as cool as can be. I highly reccomend connecting your wii to the internet so you can buy games and surf the internet on your own console right from the living room. Sadly the internet channel costs 500 points or five dollars but it's worth it. Also the Wii comes with a lot of free storage space so you probably won't have to get a memory card for a while.

Although I am a fan of their handhelds, the first console I got was a Gamecube, and I frankly was not impressed.  There was nothing to distinguish it from it's competitors (besides a lack of features), and it's game library was underwhelming.  That said, the Wii is the coolest system that I have ever had the joy of playing.  It's amazing.  I think this console is destined to become the iPod of videogames, something that revolutionizes an entire industry and basically takes over.  If it doesn't, whatever.  It's very compact and well designed, but it's what's under the hood that counts.  By now, you've heard that it's not about graphics, but a new way to control your games.  And people will say that it's just 'Cube technology with motion controls.  Well, those people are incredibly wrong.  The remote and the nunchuk are incredibly intuitive and fun to use.  Just fire up tennis in Wii sports and you'll see what I mean.  My mom tried it last night, and we were both having a blast.  Try that with a PS3 or XB360.  And it's not just for casual gamers.  The Legend of Zelda is about as hardcore as gaming gets, and it controls very well on this system.  But I think my favorite thing besides the control is the channel system.  Wehn you boot it up, the Wii displays a number of ""channels"" that you can choose.  There's the gaming channel, obviously, but then there's also an internet browsing channel, a virtual console channel (to buy old console classics), and news and weather channels.  These all work really well, and the news and weather channels are especially useful.  Best of all, it's all so streamlined.  Basically, if you are on the fence, don't be.  This system just launched, and it's already sold millions.  And with a great lineup of quality games this year (Sonic the Hedgehog, SSX, Prince of Persia, Metroid Prime 3, Super Smash Bros., Super Mario Galaxy, etc.), hopefully there won't be a software drought like with the last console, and there will be increased 3rd party support.  So what are you waiting for?

A few years back I bought a gamecube for a girlfriend(so I no long have access to that), before that I bought a PS1(at a yard sale) but never got any games for it.  Before that my parents for me a Nintendo (original NES) for my birthday and before that an Atari 2600.  I still have my NES and Atari and they work but I never play them because my computer games are just much better.  Maybe one day I can sell them for a lot of money for being in good condition and antiques.  But until then, I will play with Wii.  I was thinking about an Xbox or PS3 but they all have the same type of games as they always do, maden this or halo that.  There are a lot of sports and first person shooters.  Howeve I am not a big sports fan and my girlfriend will just complain if I'm playing RPGs all day.  Now we have games we can play together.  Not only does she like to play but even my parents like to play too.  My mom though she would hate it but once she started bowling, she was having a good time.  My dad actually wanted me to leave the game syetem over at his place so he could play more.  Now home many dads play their sons in games on an xbox360 or ps3?  If you are looking for a game system with an interface like you have never experienced get this, its fun, cheap and you won't loose your girlfriend over video games.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_205?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=205&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It lends itself well to a pick-up-and-play mentality, with no shortage of minigames available.  There are a few things to consider before purchasing one, though.

First is the Nintendo Factor.  Nintendo is very well-known for having weak support from other developers.  If you owned a Nintendo 64 or Gamecube, you might remember waiting 3 or 4 months between triple-A titles, and that hasn't changed.  If anything, it's worse, as the motion-sensing controls require developers to both think of an innovative design to incorporate them, and smoothly put them into the game.  Not everyone's up to the challenge.  The flip side of the Nintendo Factor is that you get Nintendo's first-party titles, which consistently shine as some of the best games on the market.  Super Mario Galaxy, Metroid Prime 3, Zelda: Twilight Princess, Super Smash Brothers Brawl - very safe bets.

If you like playing online, the Wii is a big disappointment.  Guitar Hero III has online play, and so will Smash Brothers, but that's about it.  This is a far cry from what you'll get on the other consoles.  The Virtual Console's selection of vintage games is nice, although it's strictly old console games - no new or independent releases.

Also, be aware of the system's power.  Aside from motion-sensing and some of the bells and whistles like an internet browser, this is in the same ballpark as a PS2 or Gamecube.  It looks better than either of those, but not by a lot.  Nintendo's art style works pretty well on it, with their games being the visual highlights, but the Wii can't do a lot of the things a PS3 or 360 can.  Games are getting bigger, more open-ended, and more freeform, and Wii owners aren't going to see a lot of that.

Of course, it's also priced much lower than the other systems - $[...] vs a suspect $[...], with much more still to buy for the latter.  The games themselves are $[...] cheaper as well.  It certainly doesn't feel like a ripoff.

I focused on those negative points because while the Wii has no shortage of (very well-deserved!) glowing press, those caveats seem to be glossed over by most outside the ""gamer culture.""  If you can handle those issues, I'm sure you and your Wii will be very happy together.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_227?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=227&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It has changed everything. 2) Games that use the controllers. Third party game developers are as excited as we are and I can't wait for each new title. 3) Virtual Console. The ability to catalog and play ALL generations of Nintendo games, plus Genesis and TurboGrafx is huge. 4) Channels. Although not released at launch future channels for news, weather, web browsing and more make obsolete all the WebTV boxes out there.

Having played video games since basically the Atari 2600. For years I have enjoyed many popular consoles. I am not against owning multiple consoles. I have always followed the games, not the boxes that play them. The Wii is literally a revolution and will make you blissfully unaware of anything else within five minutes of gameplay. I had the honor of playing a Wii about a month before its release date at a Nintendo Fusion event. In the first five minutes I understood why this console makes gaming more fun and exciting. When I got home after the event and fired up the Xbox, I almost got sick trying to play games with buttons again. You have to play the Wii to grasp the reality of it, and will then appreciate this products solid five star rating. Nintendo is a company who learns from history and has created a masterpiece that continues to blow me away. I bought the Wii because I did not want another next generation box playing the same old games with more detail. Once you play the Wii, you literally don't want to go back.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_196?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=196&reviewerType=all_reviews"

You've all heard it before: It's affordable, it's innovative, etc. so I won't repeat any of that, but what many people don't touch on is the simple convenience of using a Nintendo product overall. Their support is superb. Compared to the countless scandals with Sony using dishonest viral advertisement, Nintendo gives you just what it promises: interractive fun. The controlers work very well, much better than any similar commercial technology today, and the games are easy to get into and generally age-appropriate. The only downside is the graphics, which, while crisp and ideal for the more light-hearted fun Nintendo offers, can't match the visual power of a 360, PS3, or a PC. It also misses the more ""mature"" gamers who'd rather save the world guns blazing than roll a monkey around in a ball or play a game of bowling (with incredible realism, by the way). Though the control scheme seems ideal for First-Person Shooters, so far, Red Steel and Farcry have failed to impress, well, nearly anybody, and while Red Steel can be alot of fun, it is nowhere near as intense or innovative as Gears of War. For those of you who like both styles of gameplay, I'd opt for either the 360 in addition to your Wii, or a powerful PC.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_220?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=220&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It is slick, from its packaging to its operations and characters.  At first it was a lot of fun.  But as I improved my skills on Wii Sports (Tennis and Baseball for me, primarily) I detected the old Nintendo tendency of the system playing me!  Wii manipulates the player rather conspicuously.  Every tennis game is brought to Deuce, no matter how much the AI has to fudge to do it.  Sometimes it just renders your racket useless, sometimes it forces idiotic errors on you, or makes them itself.  It also does this with your baseball bat, and manipulates the games to get a seemingly predetermined result.

It also forces you to play against AI players with skill levels so high you really have no chance.  You do not get to select them, Wii does that.

It was great for a few weeks.  Now, I still think it's slick, but just not any fun.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_131?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=131&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Toro","Good Game System - Though it is a bit aged now","May 1, 2012","I have had the Wii for years now, and I am writing this review because it is a good system which has provided hours of entertainment to many people of different interests in my home.  If you are in the market for an inexpensive system, this is a good one to buy, as many of the games are readily available at relatively low prices.

If you want a system that will last you many years, and if you have more money to spend, you may want to wait until the next generation of gaming system is released.  However, for a light video game player, this will be a very good buy. It doesn't come with much though. You will likely need to buy a second controller and some games, as the system itself only comes with the sports games (which are OK, but you will soon want something different to play).

I recommend the Wii Play set, because it is entertaining, and has the added benefit of including an additional Wii-mote. Wii Play with Wii Remote","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_183?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=183&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you are a gamer that enjoys FPS's, get an Xbox 360 or a PS3. If you're a big RPG guy, consider another option like an online PC game. If you want to have fun for hours and hours with friends and family, consider a Wii.

I got one for Christmas. It is now about 10 days later, and no one in my family can put it down. Every day they come over to do their Wii fitness age for the day in Wii Sports. My brother, dad, wife, and son can't get off of Excite Truck and various Wii Sports games. My mom wants to bowl all the time. A good friend is constantly playing tennis and Zelda.

This is the most fun I've ever had with a console. My brother's 360 has sat dormant since Christmas...even the two new games he got for it have hardly been played.

The Wii is for old and young alike. It is not for the hardcore gamer that wants realistic blood & gore. It is a system for families and friends to play and laugh together.

I got Zelda for the Wii. It's fun. But I agree that the Wiimote's capabilities don't add a lot to this game. Maybe in a future version it will. Right now, many of these games were made for the Gamecube and have simply been ""adjusted"" to work with the Wiimote. The games such as Wii Sports & Excite Truck were specifically made for the Wii and really show off how the controller can enhance gameplay. Soon, more game developers will begin to understand how to best utilize the Wiimote's abilities. A year down the road we'll start to see FPSs and RPGs that will compete with the 360 and PS3 for gameplay.

Until then, hardcore gamers stick with those systems and the rest of us will have a blast playing this totally new type of gaming console. This is not the next generation of the same old console. The Wii is a whole new category of gaming console. Not necessarily better, but altogether different.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_176?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=176&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have been BEYOND pleased with how much the entire family has enjoyed playing the Wii. My 72-year-old mother-in-law even likes it! It's an awesome party game and the included ""sports package"" provides hours of fun. I would recommend buying an extra remote and nunchuck because most of the games are more fun when played in multiplayer mode. If you have more than 2 children, I would probably purchase 3 extra remotes and nunchucks. Several of the games can support 4 players. The ""Wii Play"" game comes with a remote and like 9 games and at $5 more than the remote alone, it's a no-brainer purchase. The Wii is not comparable to a PS3 or XBOX for graphics, hard drive, etc. but that is not what makes it great. The motion-sensing controllers and user-friendly gameplay are what make Wii a top seller. Everyone I know who has one loves it. I'm completely satisfied with this purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Even now, several months after I purchased my Wii, I still end up playing for extended periods when I do play. My opinion is that the Wii is best suited to being a group play console, since the fun you're having playing with other people helps offset the distinctly primitive-seeming graphics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_235?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=235&reviewerType=all_reviews"

For years I was a dedicated PC-gamer. I though ill of gaming consoles, considering them consumer-toys rather than entertainment systems. Who needs overpriced and oversized gaming consoles that can play Movie-DVDs and even BluRayDisks when most good games are released for PCs as well and they look and play better on them? And I was mostly right. However, the NINTENDO Wii is a different breed.

Gaming on the Wii is an experience one has to live at least once - but preferably whenever he or she feels blue. Sure, it may not sport the cutting-edge graphical capabilities of a SONY PS3 or the game titles selection of the XBox. Nevertheless, most Wii games take full advantage of the consoles capabilities and the exclusive games selection include the unsurpassable The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, the absorbing Metroid Prime Trilogy, the mesmerizing Okami and the soothing Endless Ocean: Blue World.
Not to mention the capabilities of Wii Fit Plus and Wii Sports Resort when coupled with a Wii Balance Board!

If you can still find one, I would advise buying the (Limited edition) black one. I keep mine in our TV room and the black blends perfectly with my other home entertainment electronics. In any case, do not miss the revolution.

There is simply no other console that offers so much fun. Both SONY and MICROSOFT have technologically excellent gaming consoles - but NINTENDO is the only one that always keeps in mind that gaming is supposed to be FUN.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_177?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=177&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I found this game console very interesting, and a lot of fun. It came with the ""Wii Sports"" game. I highly recommend to make sure this game comes with it if you purchase a game console. The sports game by itself sell's for around $50.00, So getting it makes this package a fare deal.

It gets used everyday, keeps a record of what you've done and estimates your age ""according"" to your performance at a random collection of activity's that it picks out for you to do. Get a few people together and it can really be a lot of fun. Some of my friends have bought one since they played ours.

It has everything built in to connect to your wireless internet. It found it and connected without any problems, very easy, and nothing extra to buy. Has it's own weather and news channels (and of course shopping channel). Now we send e-mail and pictures to our friends and family using the Wii. And it show's up on their Wii.
One thing, you can only play certain games on the internet against others, and there aren't that many of them yet.. That's about the only little negative thing I can think of... and I'm sure there will be more ""internet play"" games coming out.
I recommend this game, for everyone, children and adults. It's an active game, not just pushing buttons.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

You have to swing at the right time to hit a ball in baseball, you have to push the control at the right time, to tackle an apponent in Football, you have to move left and right (quickly) or your face will be knocked out in boxing.

Most games made for the Wii involve physical activity, which is a big improvement over previous ""couch potato"" video games. But many classic games are available for the Wii too. We have MarioKart which is a lot of fun but doesn't involve activity. Like all newer game consoles, Wii has WIFI so some games can be played on-line.
The reason I gave it four stars instead of 5 is Nintendo's marketing strategy of keeping Wii and Wii fit artificially scarce to keep prices up. This gives way to phony ""bundles"" where the seller throws in low value or worthless items and doubles the price. Hold out for just a Wii at the list price. You will find one if you keep looking and calling. All Wii consoles come with Wii Sports which is still the best Wii game package. Before buying other games, check out reviews and consider renting games first.

The PS3's is price, the Xbox 360's is the lack of hardware that comes with the regular package, and having to pay for Xbox live, and the Wii's is it's lack of great graphics, and how the Wiimote almost makes it limited.

The Wii is the console that you sit down and play with the family. Even those with little or no gaming experience can enjoy the Wii, with it's awesome multiplayer capabilities, and the Wiimote is just an extension of your arm that controls the game. You feel like you're in the game, and thats what makes this console the most intersting. Xbox has it's games, PS3 has it's Blu-ray and stunning graphics, but the Wii really shines in playability. You want to play the Wii, and games like Wii sports really gets everyone involved.

Overall, I think that anybody would not be disappointed getting the Wii, but the only problem with ordering off amazon, is that the versions they're selling actually cost more than the 80g PS3 bundle.

I should probably just sell it back to someone on here.

To clarify my title: If you or your kid actively plays XBOX or PS3 then they probably won't like the wii. its for smaller children and families. The games are fun and mostly simple. the motion activated controllers aren't perfect and it has an awkward learning curve.

It seems that each game handle the motion controller differently to the point that you have to relearn with every game. Its annoying.

the graphics are poopoo compared to the XBOX and PS3. this is not a blueray player, ps3 is.

This system is cheap compared to the ps3 and the 360 and that is mainly why I ended up buying it. The motion sensor stuff should end up being really good once developers take the time to make good games. It appears to be solidly made and I like the color, doesn't look cheap.

The backward compatibility is a good thing for me, I really can't afford to buy the $50 wii games at the moment. But you need a gamecube controller and memory card to play the old games - the wii controller will not work.

I'm really looking forward to seeing how nintendo uses the usb ports in the future. Having an internal memory (512mb) is a really good idea, and using SD cards as memory as well is nice because those have gone down in price considerably.

I loved it.  I used to work for gamestop before I moved also. This is a great system.  It is very social orientied and loads of fun if you have friends over to play.  Here is a warning though, once u get a Wii then you run into the problem of finding the controllers for it.  You will have to hunt for controllers.  I recommend getting Zelda when you get the system.  Wii sports is a great game, it just gets old after a while if you play by yourself.  The virtual console is good so far, but not great.  Many classic games that bring back memories. When i got my Wii, i just happened to walk into a gamestop and they had one left from their afternoon shipment. When i was buying mine someone else walked in asking for one. So if you dont wanna pay the money on ebay for one, just hunt around various game and huge retail stores.

Yet only a few years into owning it, Nintendo cut off some of the primary game features that I bought it for in the first place, like the ability to play with users online.  Best guess is they are trying to force users to migrate to newer consoles, but not all of us can afford to upgrade every few years, nor is each new iteration worth shelling out for.  Removing features that were part of the product description when I paid for it is a terrible business model and one of the worst aspects of the digital age.

Unable to get the most out of my Wii games, I turned to downloading retro games through the Virtual Console.  But one day I accidentally downloaded the wrong one, and when I contacted Customer Support hoping that I could exchange it for the correct product, they wouldn't even consider it.  They simply said they do not allow returns and quoted something about Terms of Service.  What kind of company cares so little about customer service that they won't do something as simple as exchanging a digital download at no monetary loss to themselves?  I don't have a lot of disposable income, so this was a blow to morale and a huge disappointment in the Nintendo company.

I've always liked their games but I guess they really just don't give a flying fig about the people that support them and made them what they are today.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_173?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=173&reviewerType=all_reviews"

As an old school gamer who grew up playing Nintendo systems, the Wii was the first ""next gen"" console that I sought out and I have been very pleased with the gaming experience that it offers. It is not a system designed for the hardcore gamer, rather one that is meant to reach a wider demographic of people who may not have grown up playing games. Below is a summary of the good and bad aspects of the system and the games available; keep in mind that these are subjective to the gamer.

Pros:

1. Quality first-person titles and an improving library of third-person games. Many may dismiss the Wii on the basis of it being a ""kiddy"" or ""lifestyle"" system based on the lack of adult-oriented games, however few can argue that Nintendo really delivers with their franchises. ""Super Mario Galaxy"", ""Metroid Prime 3"", ""Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess"" and ""Mario Kart Wii"" are all fantastic games that really do the franchises justice. As the system has aged, more quality third-party titles have emerged such as ""Mad World"", ""House of the Dead: Overkill"", ""No More Heroes"", ""Okami"", and ""Klonoa"".

2. Innovative controls. When properly utilized in a game, the unique motion controls of the Wii Remote are a blast and they do bring a new level of depth to the gameplay. Sports games, puzzles and platformers all benefit from this and it makes the game more involving; rather than having to remember what 8 buttons perform what functions, it's all about pressing a few buttons and waggling the remote.

3. User-Friendly Interface. The Wii menu is perhaps the most streamlined and easy to use dashboard out of all the consoles. The Wii Shop is also easy to navigate in and out of, and shopping for games and add-ons is a snap.

4. The Virtual Console. As was the case with the GBA and the DS, Nintendo is making a killing off of their old titles. The Virtual Console allows you to download classic games from the NES, SNES, Genesis, Neo Geo, and a host of other systems. The Classic Controller is require to play them, however this is a nice add on especially for older gamers who grew up in the 8-bit and 16-bit eras.

5. Integrated wireless card. If you have wireless internet and your router is compatible with the Wii, this is your best bet for connecting the console to the internet.

Cons:

1. No Ethernet port. I am not sure how Nintendo screwed this up, however there is no Ethernet port in the back of the console; there are only 2 USB ports and you will need to purchase a LAN adapter separately. This is an annoyance if you don't use wireless internet.

2. Inferior graphics. If you are a gamer that needs to have the best graphics, then you will be better off with the PS3 or the Xbox 360. The Wii has good graphics however it is technically inferior to the competition. Sadly, this means that some of the cross-platform titles will be inferior on the Wii, but then again graphics are not everything.

3. Gimmicky games. Because of the unique controls, a lot of the games being produced for the Wii are gimmicky and focused more on the controls rather than story and gameplay. For me, this includes the ""Wii Fit"" and ""Wii Sports"". Both games were fun for the first few weeks, however I got bored once the novelty wore off and I have not played either game since. This has improved over the lifespan of the system, however this is still a lot of ""Shovelware"" being produced.

4. Limited memory. The Wii only comes with 512 MB of internal memory, which is a drop in the bucket compared to the 120 GB and 160 GB hard drives being offered on the Xbox 360 and PS3 respectively. I guess this is because the Wii is not download-intensive, however the 512 MB gets eaten up quickly if you download a lot of Virtual Console and Wii Ware games. Fortunately, they system allows you to use an SD card to store and back-up downloaded content.

The Pros and Cons of any video game system often depend on the gamer, so the above is just my own personal impressions after having owned my Wii for almost one year. Overall, I like the system a lot and I play it often despite a few shortcomings. I also own an Xbox 360 and that fulfills whatever needs that the Wii is not currently meeting, so I have no regrets about purchasing this console.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_175?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=175&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's great. It only took 15 minutes to setup and then I was playing tennis, boxing, bowling, and finally the Marvel Ultimate Alliance game. This game is great for two big reasons. First, I actually got tired boxing and got a little winded playing tennis. That is great for the kids. They won't just sit there and push buttons. The 2nd great thing is the numchuck. I have never been good at figuring out the combiantions of buttons to press, and the numchuck minizmizes the need for that skill. The only negative are the graphics, but for $250 they are fine.

Understand I am so fond of the memories that Nintendo has shared with me. My first NES Super Mario Bros & Duck Hunt, With Zapper. The Original Legend Of Zelda packaged in a gold cartridge.

Super Nintendo with Mario All stars & Super Mario world. Nintendo 64 the very finest TOP FLIGHT of the Nintendo platforms. So many consistently awesome titles. Mario kart 64, Super Mario 64, Doom 64, Quake 64,, and the Zelda titles. Top Flight bitches.

I will even give the Game Cube a nod over Xbox, or PS2. The Micro mini discs were too sweet. The best cube in the world. So much technology packed into a small space became a gadget we can still marvel at today. In spite of all the child orientated games, I loved you Nintendo. To thank the millions of people who loved you and had similar stories of gaming glory. You reward us with......

The Nintendo Wii with motion plus controllers. I like the concept your hand is the controller. Here the problems one by one. 1. For the price they charged, would it of killed them for Bluetooth control? Leaving us with a constantly fluctuating signal even with the sensor bar aligned. Sometimes, not often it would work as intended. 2. No HDMI input. The PS3, and Xbox 360 both were out at the time of this technology, and a blind man could of has seen HDMI was the way of the future. A Nice bonus was this technology was included in both PS3 & Xbox360.
3. No playback of DVD, or Blue ray technology.
4. Bad features of a remote. The controller later released for retail @ $59.99, It should have been included for when the sensor alignment fails, and sooner, or later it always does.

For these reasons, and the many nearly unplayable games like The steering wheel for Mario kart Wii. Which in a later review I systematically take Mario Kart Wii apart and expose it for the trash it is, and why it nearly killed a franchise. That's for a later day. It's for the aforementioned reasons above that I could never give Wii U a chance it's still more of the same BS. Thanks for fixing a nearly unplayable platform, giving it a fresh coat of paint with the fixes. Tuh Duh! may I present Wii U, It's what Wii should have been in the first place.

No thank you Nintendo. I think I will wait for your next console to be released. I know sooner, or later you will make another great system. You did it in the past, It's most likely in your future as well.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_219?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=219&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have it connected online with the built in wifi, which was pretty strait forward.  If you have a wireless router they have a decent technical assist section and if you don't the nintendo wifi adapter is inexpensive and works for both your DS and Wii.  I would also like to say I have every other cosole and both handhelds DS/PSP.  I don't care who makes it as long as it is fun, so this is in no way bashing or favoring a product based on the manufacturer.  The only way I'll have a high sense of Brand loyality is if I own stock in a company.

GAMES:

The system is fun and different.  I've played Wii sports, supermonkey ball, Excite truck, rayman, elbits, Madden, and trauma center (never have been a huge zelda fan, so waiting to rent.)  I wouldn't rate any of these games higher than a 7 out of ten.  I really wish excite truck had online play as it would have raised the replayability a little.  The best thing about the wii is that the games aren't just a ""graphical"" upgrade.  They try to get you involved.  My favorite so far is wii sports.  I turned trauma center off after about 15 minutes because I have the DS version and it didn't seem fun to me anymore, and man does the dialoge get long.  I haven't used the virtual console yet because paying 5 dollars for a game that I'll play for a few minutes is way to much.  So as far as games go, there aren't any (unless your a zelda fan) that feel that polished and worth the 50 dollar price tag, in my opinion. Before buying I'd recommend checking a game review site such as IGN.com or Gamespot.

Controller:

I like the new controller but don't like have to buy a wiimote 40 dollars and the the nunchuck 20 dollars.  Most games require both so if you want to play multiplayer you have to buy at least one extra set.  The system does come with one complete set.  I enjoyed the new controller because its different.  I don't want three new consoles with almost the same exact input device.  I'm glad they changed it up.

Backwards compatible Gamecube:

Excellent.  It's as easy as pie.  Pop the top cover and plug in you wave bird and cube memeory card and your good to go.  For anyone looking to buy a gamecube I'd say just wait till you can buy a wii.  Not only will you be able to play the new games but you'll be able to play every gamecube game.  They really did this feature right.

The internet browser:

Is currently free and works well with the wiimote.  It wasn't as painfull as using my psp.  You can easily navigate through menus and zoom in on pictures.  The weather channel also works well showing up to a 5 day forcast, but if you already have a computer this is just a ""neat feature"".

I know a lot of people are going to hate me for this comment, but right now the wii isn't a must have gaming machine.  Why, because it's only two months into the launch and the game line up is very meak.  This is to be expected and as wario ware, super mario, metroid come out we'll see exactly what the system has to offer.  For those of you dieing to get your hands on one, relax. ours has been sitting for the last 3 days untouched. The newness wears off and your left with one or two games.

  Again these are my OPINION's,  I think a lot of the people who reviewed the system on here did so within a day or so of turning it on for the first time.  Everyone loves that new car smell.  To me its always about the games, not who sells it but how much fun it is to play.  I not an english teacher or a student so if you don't like my spelling/grammer to bad I already graduated and you can't take my degree.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_243?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=243&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The last game I played was doom ( a couple of times when it was released and then got bored of that).
Nintendo Wii has converted such a person to a game addict (almost - not quite yet!). The included sports game disk is good (I do have some issues - there is room for improvement in tennis in placement of the ball, you cannot move the player etc).
I also tried Mario and Sonic at the olympics another great game for Wii.
In all it is a great entertainment for the whole family.
I wish Nintendo makes it less scarce in the US.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My kids (and I) love it!!!","February 24, 2007","I bought this for my son as a Christmas present.  He absolutely loves it.  I also love it and I'm not really into video games anymore.  This game is just so radically different, it takes me back to my youth when games using joysticks and paddles and were all about fun, not trying to out-technology each other.  The included Wii Sports game is a blast. It introduces you to the controllers very nicely.  Although the remote and nunchuck feel a little weird at first, they are very intuitive because body movements are far easier than just mashing finger buttons.  Setup was pretty easy and we were playing in minutes.  The graphics are very nice.  I really don't care if they're not in the highest 1080-whatever resolution and doubt most kids my son's age will either (or adults just looking for pure fun).  Gameplay is smooth and very immersive.  The games all have the usual Nintendo feel of family fun.  The Wii Wi-Fi setup was also a breeze.  After connecting both Wii's to our home network, we were immediately checking sports, weather, and news over Nintendo's free online service. The Wii uses a standard SD card for memory.  I was able to give my son a huge memory card for almost nothing (compared to previous prices for memory cards on his PS2 and Gamecube).  There is a reason these things are selling like hotcakes. Besides the buyer-friendly price, it's a great console.  My son was so possessive of his Wii, my daughters pooled their Christmas money and gift cards to buy their own.  Now they play each other wirelessly.  I only have a few very minor gripes.  The battery life in the controllers is pretty bad.  These things suck down AA batteries like crazy.  I've already changed the batteries twice in each remote during a month of gameplay.  I'm about to invest in some rechargable AA's.  The remote also sometimes loses it's partnership with the console when the batteries are exhausted.  You also have to be careful with the wrist strap.  The strap on my daughter's remote snapped after only a week; and it was supposedly one of the improved ones.  Fortunately, the remote remained in her hand and didn't result in one of those flying Wii remote stories posted all over the web.  To Nintendo's credit, I received two new straps by mail in less than a week after completing a brief online form. Other than the strap, the quality of the materials is excellent.  Our remotes have been dropped several times, including once on a hard ceramic tile floor, and haven't suffered a scratch. Nintendo also extended our warranty to 15 months after we registered our Wii online (Don't know how long this deal will last, but it's worth a few minutes on the web for 90 extra days peace-of-mind). Don't despair if you can't find a Wii on store shelves.  If you scout the advertisements and show up at the store when they open, you have a very good chance at scoring one; no lines or camping.  Just make sure you're there at opening because they usually sell out very fast.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_192?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=192&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Never in the history of console gaming systems has a system brought together people young and old.

I even brought the Wii on our family vacation (we're all grown adults) and it was one of the best ideas we've had to fill in those empty moments in the evenings.  It is akin to a board game, where you can learn it and pick it up in a matter of minutes and enjoy it with your family for the rest of the afternoon, and that's just with the Wii Sports that comes with the console, let alone the other games you can purchase.

She has played until as late as 2 A.M. on more than one occasion. And we made Wii people to represent her, my grandson and myself. When we are not there she will play and call me up laughing and say that it is hilareous to see me and my grandson watching her play from the stands.

The idea and execution of the Wii is simply amazing. I never got into video games, because hitting buttons on a controller and just sitting there is boring to me. The Wii solves this for me and is a great way to both get exercise and play a game. Being physically active is a big part of my life, and this is a way to bridge both exercise and fun. Brilliant!

The sports games that come with the Wii are cartoony and get old after a while, but they are meant to show game developers what can be done. For instance, there is a Brunswick bowling game that is more difficult and is photorealistic than the bowling game that comes with the Wii.

I'm just waiting for them to have controllers that you strap to your wrists and ankles...","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_199?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=199&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I recommend this seller.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_202?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=202&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After we tucked the kids away in bed mom and dad decided to give the console the official functional/working test so the kids would not be disappointed on Christmas day. First off let me say how impressed we were with the efficiency of the packaging. Everything in it's place with no wasted space and no room to move around and get damaged during shipment. Typical Nintendo quality. Everything packed in foam and plastic in marked boxes labeled 1 & 2. Installation and setup was very easy. The system is tiny and appears to be very solid and well made. We installed the 4 GB SD card that I had purchased from Newegg and the system recognized it with no problems. We attached to our HDTV with the supplied composite cables and proceeded to load up Wii Sports. All I can say is my wife and I have not had this much fun with a video game console in a long time. That remote is something else. Very accurate, realistic and fun. We played with the tennis and bowling before we decided to box it all back up for Christmas. You do need plenty of room for those vigorous swings. All in all were very happy with the purchase. If I had anything negative to say it would be with the cables included. I wish Nintendo had supplied the component video/audio cables for use on HDTV's instead of the composite cable. This system is highly recommended!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_180?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=180&reviewerType=all_reviews"

In one word, the Wii is a lot of fun.

Compared to the other consoles:

XB360: The XB360 is simply a gaming powerhouse. The XB Live experience is also, in my opinion, far superior than PSN.

PS3: Honestly, I don't own any games for the PS3 other than a few arcade games. I use my PS3 simply for the BluRay player. However, I will add that the PS3 does integrate with the Sony PSP very well.

Wii: Once again, Nintendo doesn't follow the status quo and comes up with something unique. Nintendo for went diving into high definition and instead gave us unique game interaction which is proving to be very enjoyable. However, if you have an ED/HDTV, I would still recommend picking up a pair of component cables for the Wii. Even if you have a standard TV, with S-Video in, I would also recommend picking up an S-Video cable. The composite video is a little on the weak side, which leads to some artifacting and flickering in blue fields. Either of these cables will eliminate this. I also recommend networking the Wii since you will be able to get updates. The Wii has built in wireless (and supports WPA/WPA2) networking, but if you have a wired network you will have to pick up an additional USB-Ethernet adapter. If you network your Wii, definetly purchase the [...] ""Internet Channel"" (which is actually an optimized Opera browser.) The browser works very well and loads pages fast. It is even better than the PS3's browser. Why it wasn't included, I don't know. It even works great with YouTube!

The virtual consoles (NES, SNES, N64, Genesis, etc) games are a little pricey in my opinion ([...]), but I still bought SM1, SM2, SM3, SMW, SM64.

Like the other two consoles, I recommend running it horizontally instead of vertically. I simply don't trust the drives to give as much life running vertically as they would horizontally.

(EDIT:  I'm adding this long after I posted this review, but you can organize your channels.  I discovered how by accident!  Simply press and hold both the ""A"" button and trigger, while over a channel.  The channel will be ""picked up"" and you can drag it anywhere you like.  Yeah, this was probably in the manual, but who reads manuals?)  :-)

Overall, it is a very fun system.

I am glad I bought it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_176?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=176&reviewerType=all_reviews"

You can find them at Target, Toys R Us, K-Mart and Walmart if you keep checking.  I attemtped to buy one from a lesser known market with terrbile results and recommend sticking to known retailers.

This system is EASY to install and set up.  We had the wii up and running in 15 minutes.  wii Sports is usually included with the console so you don't have to go out and buy a video game to start. This game gets you active and is a great introduction to how the sytem works. Most reviewers have already detailed the inner workings so I will just add that whoever thought this sytem up was a genuis!!  The interaction between the controls and the video game are amazing.  This system beats any other in my view.  The potential for wii is mind boggling although they have been a little a slow in output lately.  Hmmmm.  I will sit in anticipation of what they will think up next.  I do have my eyes on a wii Fit but wonder what lies ahead.......

There are great resources (including Amazon) to research the best games to suit your interests.  I recommend checking reviews, renting them or checking at your local library before buying since they can be pretty expensive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I probably won't be able to say enough to satisfy all the Wii devotees or I'll say too much to fire up all the detractors.  If you are an inflexible ""full time gamer"" who can't seem to get past one shortcoming or another because the Wii isn't up to your standards, don't bother reading on.  If you have never played a video game and are exploring the option for yourself or children, then this may be of some help.

I've read many reviews of the Wii that begin, ""I had it a week (or month) and it's now collecting dust because it didn't (fill in un-met expectation here) compared to the (XBOX 360, PS___, etc).  It's unfortunate that way too many folks these days need instant gratification in order to be fulfilled or narrowly define what is considered worthy or not based on a comparison to something it isn't supposed to be compared to.  There's 2 things that I think are obvious about the Nintendo Wii: 1-it was created for a specific target audience, namely, Nintendo loyalists wanting the next generation Nintendo console, non typical gamers and kids; and 2: it was not created to compete head to head with the graphics intensive and usually brutally violent games of the XBOX and PlayStation line.  If you understand these two points, you will see that the Wii is an excellent choice.  My family is easy to please as we still purchase board games and we all enjoy playing those as well as all the electronica that comes and goes in an instant.

After a year, the hype of being newly released cannot account for the lack of availability.  Wii's are in short supply for a good reason, they're a great buy.  The price is well below the other guys but the bang for the buck is more than many things I've purchased before. Availability of games is also not a problem.  My last visit to Wally World found shelves full of a variety of games.  The Wii also allows older folks who have never played a video game to get in there and play against 5 year olds by using familiar movements like throwing a bowling ball or swinging a bat or tennis racquet to perform the onscreen actions.  The idea that a family can get together and play is a diminishing trend due partly to the fact that more kids are playing video games that parents don't have time to learn or even understand.  The Wii also plays the earlier Gamecube games that will soon become available at bargain prices or were purchased over the years of use with the Gamecube.  We have plenty and my kids still enjoy those games as well.  There are slots for the Gamecube controllers, memory cards and microphone as used in the Mario Party games and 2 USB slots for a keyboard and whatever else Nintendo offers as a USB add on.  Another nice feature is the wireless connectivity.  If you have a wireless Internet connection in your home, the Wii will find it and connect to offer on-line Nintendo shopping, weather and news.

There's not a lot of sitting around with many of the Wii games.  You have to move.  Every notion you've had about kids staring at video game screens while buried down in the couch cushions may change after using the Wii.  Some of these games require movements that will almost wear you out.  I've watched my kids play just about every game we have standing up.  We have Guitar Hero III and I have a better appreciation for the effort that rockers have made over the years in their performances.  The cover versions of the classic rock songs are excellent and my kids are enjoying the rock songs we listened to in the 60's, 70's and 80's.  I've even been forced to listen and ""play"" a variety of musical genres that I previously ignored and actually now like some grunge and heavy metal.

The biggest after purchase cost over-run for me came from purchasing extra controllers.  The typical Wii package comes with one controller.  Depending on the game, if more than one person wants to play, you have to pass the controller from player to player and this doesn't work for team or head to head games.  Extra controllers run about 40 bucks and the Wii can handle up to 4.  Although not necessary, a standard SD memory card can be used to store games and settings and those are available these days for under 15 bucks.  This is a big improvement over the expensive propriatary memory cards that were used with the Gamecubes and were never enough for all the saved games.  In all, I probably dropped 600 bucks for the console, 4 controllers, 1 extra nunchuk, battery charger and stand, 6 game discs, and all of this was purchased at ""normal"" retail prices.  With the price gouging out there, this was actually a good deal.  Please don't be suckered into over paying due to impatience.  The Wii will be available soon when things settle down and waiting will also be a good lesson in patience.

Finally, I appreciate Nintendo's effort to include parental controls with both the Wii and access to their website.  In order for me to allow my kids access to their webpage, I had to fax an application detailing what I would allow my kids access to before they could begin using the website.  To some that may be overkill but to those of us that understand the dangers of the internet (predators and unscrupulous marketing techniques) Nintendo of America is a breath of fresh air.  Also, through the Wii menu, I can limit or deny access my kids have to games rated as inappropriate for kids of their age.

Usually when a product is hyped as much as this, you are setting yourself up for a big disappointment.

Absolutely NOT the case with the Nintendo Wii. I've been playing video games since the days of PONG and have NEVER had so much fun as I have with the Wii.

Yep the Xbox 360 and the PS3 have better graphics. GRAPHICS SMAPHICS! Can you say FUN???

Video games are supposed to be entertainment and the Wii system does entertainment in spades! Everyone that's played our system says they are going to get one. The Wii system is probably the best party game around and will bring smiles and laughter to everyone that plays. Even those curmudgeons who don't play video games get hooked!

Wii Sports is included with the console and with that game alone the system is well worth the money. The number and variety of games will satisfy both kids AND adults! Want to burn some calories? Go a few rounds of boxing. You'll lose weight I guarantee it! We're also looking forward to the balance board and Wii Fitness that is going to be released this holiday season. Imagine having a game system that also doubles as your gym?

But there are also a ton of games from third party developers that are outstanding! For example, check out my review of Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08.

It's absolutely incredible that a system this much fun is HALF the price of the ""next gen"" systems. The only thing ""next gen"" about the Xbox 360 and the PS3 is their processing power. The Nintendo Wii truly qualifies as the Next Generation of Video Gaming.

Trust me, take the bucks you would spend on a bare bones Xbox 360 or a PS3 and get the Wii and a ton of FUN games.

The first night we set it up, my husband and I NEEDED to box each other.  In 30 minutes we were DRENCHED with sweat and laughing and having a great time.  Since then, this video game console has been the center of parties (the kids have gotten Guitar Hero and many other things), family entertainment and so much more.  With 4 kids we need to have stuff for them to do on days when you can't get out of the house (aka 24 inches of snow) and they need to get rid of energy.  We have other gaming consoles and 9 times out of 10 they pick the Wii.  This Christmas, I bought one for my mother and it was worth it.  My mother-in-law has one and they have ""Wii Parties"" where they get together and golf, play tennis and more.

We have different games for the unit - from Wii Music to Guitar Hero to Mario Cart.  There haven't been any we aren't happy with and NONE just sit on the shelf.

The ages can vary as you can tell - from my parents (ages 70-75) to friends kids ages 4+ and everyone has fun.  I see (as a mom) less arguments when they are playing this than any other video game system. It's all fun!

Well worth the money!

I've been anticipating this console ever since what seems like ages ago when I'd first heard of its development. Immediately upon getting it home, I didn't rush to unwrap Zelda: Twilight Princess (a game I'd had on pre-order as a Gamecube title almost for 2 years!) or Trauma Center -- I set out to check out what online capabilities my new Wii had.

Unfortunately, a lot of the online features will not be available until late December/early January, but I knew this prior to launch day, so it wasn't that big of a disappointment. The Opera browser isn't yet available, but when it is, it will be free until June 2007 in the Shopping Channel, which is found within the Wii's main menu. Also in the Shopping Channel is Virtual Console. Through Virtual Console, the Wii-user may purchase Wii Points (1USD = 100 points), which is the currency used to purchase classic games of Sega Genesis, NES, SNES, N64 and TurboGrafx16 fame. Currently, Nintendo has only been releasing a few of these at a time every Monday, and there weren't very many out to start on launch day. What games are available, however, are great titles. I've personally been taking advantage of the available TG16 titles such as Super Star Soldier since I'd never had the console.

The Weather and News Channels also are not up yet and will not be until late December/early January. Through the Photo Channel, you can store and edit (to some extent) photos on your Wii. You can also send photos to other Wii-friends. I've also found that your Wii is given an e-mail address (w+wiicode@wii.com), which you can send photos to if you do not have an sd-card. However, you must use an sd card for mp3s and movs (the only audio and video formats I believe work on the Wii) as there are size limitations and file restrictions. The Mii Channel is a fun way to create characters that resemble yourself or others. You can send your Mii to your friends, and you can set your Miis to ""mingle,"" which will enable all Miis on your Mii Plaza (including those sent to you) to be sent to everyone on your friends list to a place called the ""Mii Parade"" in which they can choose to keep them or dispose of them (sad.)

Of the Wiimote, I've found it to be completely intuitive and not in the least intimidating or difficult to control. Wii Sports is a great introduction to using the Wii-mote, but it definitely just isn't a demonstration of how to use it. I still avidly play Wii Sports by myself and with others and I forsee myself continuing to do so for a very long time. I've barely started Zelda: Twilight Princess because of finals, but, what I've played of it is completely and literally awesome. I still plan on picking up my Gamecube version of the title, but the Wii controls are perfect for this title. There's one major difference between the Wii and Gamecuve versions: Link is now right-handed, for the first time ever in the Wii version. This change was, of course, made because most people are right-handed and the controls rely on the Wii-mote. Although I am right-handed, I kind of wish they hadn't made this change or, at least, made a left or right handed preference choice like in Wii Sports. For those of you familiar with the DS title Trauma Center, I recommend picking it up for the Wii. It's the same story-line but with a few differences and some bonus levels added in. The controls are more forgiving than in the DS version, but overall, it's actually a bit harder.

I don't know how to end this review, but I should really get back to studying for finals so that I may fully deserve my Zelda-fest come next week! For all of you who don't have such obligations, go play Wii!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_183?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=183&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'll be honest, I loved my old Wii, I used to play Super Smash Bros Brawl using my Gamecube controllers and it was a lot of fun, until my brother had an accident and it stopped working. I ultimately decided to get a new Wii, but everywhere I looked I only found the NEW Wii consoles that aren't backwards-compatible with Gamecube controllers and accessories for some reason, which I didn't want because I have a lot of Gamecube games that I'd like to keep playing.
After a few hours of browsing, I FINALLY find a Wii that CLEARLY SAYS it has backwards compatibility (The one I ordered), HOWEVER it turns out it doesn't, so now I have to return it.

Why Amazon?
I don't even know why you haven't changed the ""Product Description"" section since it CLEARLY states that the product I ordered has backwards-compatibility with the Gamecube, nor do I care at this point. I just want my money back now, thanks for nothing Amazon.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_151?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=151&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They are constantly coming out with games and they are so totally worth the price depending on which game you buy. I've played Super Mario Galaxy and it is just amazing. Now, there's already a Super Mario Galaxy 2 coming out! This is one of the best gaming softwares I think there could be in the present time, with it's unique style of gameplay. It's so much different than the other consoles and it also is alot more cheaper too ;)! That's something we could ALL get along with hahaha! This has amazing graphics and it has new innovative ways to have fun! It's even funner when playing in a group. It also sources as a way to get active, because Nintendo also provides you with fun active games like Wii Sports, Wii Sports Resort, Wii Skiing, and MANY MORE! I love this console and I think it's the best out yet.

Some reviewers have complained about the graphics and/or the games in their reviews - if you've done any research at all you know this system is targeted at younger children and parents who want alternatives to Doom, Grand Theft Auto, Mortal Kombat and other shoot-em-up games. Nintendo doesn't try to hide that that the graphics and many of the games are simple. And man is it fun!

Not every game utilizes the remote well, but the ones that do are great fun and I'm sure more titles will be added soon.  As for the games that don't, we just hook up a different controller.  We've been playing Wario Smooth Moves and Rayman Raving Rabbids and they're hilarious.  Laughing, talking, moving (as opposed to sitting like a lump)... simply the best.

It's definitely not for the graphics snobs out there or others who like the more intense games but that's why the Xbox 360 and the PS3 consoles exist.

I have one gripe with Nintendo though, and this is a warning to anyone new to the system (like me): the instructions are useless.  I figured out more just by trial and error than by using the booklet that came with the system.  Not a big deal, just a warning.  Also, don't for a minute believe amazon on the delivery time-they are full of it.  I ordered it with basic shipping, I wasn't in a hurry, HOWEVER, waiting 5 business days just to fulfill my order is ridiculous.  I can guarantee that if I paid for the express shipping, I wouldn't have received it by the time they guaranteed.  How do I know this?  Because once packed, it only took 3 days to ship, which has never happened before.  A big deal? maybe not, but I wnated to warn anyone who was buying this as a gift.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_122?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=122&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was a huge fan of the Super Nintendo. I loved Zelda, Mario Brothers, and Donkey Kong. More recently I felt that video game systems got away from the fun side of it all and got too serious. I always enjoy playing a game that didn't require a person to spend hours on end to have fun playing it. I like to pop the game it play for a little while and turn it off. I don't want to stress out and get mad while playing a video game. After one day of playing Nintendo's latest entry in the gaming market. And being the first video game system I have purchased for myself in 15 years. After actually being excited about finding and purchasing an electronic device for the first time in my life. The Wii brings back what it feels like to be 10 years old again. It is very exciting. Having only played the Wii Sports game that came with the system. I am very impressed with just how much fun Nintendo has made gaming become again. The Wii will be something really big for Nintendo. I can't wait to see what kinda games they have up their sleeves!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_233?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=233&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But I also love the Xbox and the 360.  I also love the PS2 and the PS3.  I won't even get inot Sega systems.  That tells you right there that I am not a fanboy...I simply love games.  A console is a very hard item to review.  The success of a system always comes down to software.  The Wii has a great, innovative new way of playing games.  Playing games in this new way means nothing if the games themselves are not fun to play.  But I am not worried at all because Nintendo has always made fun games.  Let's see if third party developers can do the same.  It's true that the Wii isn't as powerful as the 360 and PS3, but I have never been big on graphics, even though I know a lot of people are, even though they shouldn't be.  I know it doesn't support HD but games still look beautiful running in 480p.  Just look at Twilight Princess.  And games are only going to keep getting better visually as time goes on.  Just look at some of the stunning games that are pushing the PS2 to the limit.  Only time can do that.  Built-in wi-fi means that you'll be downloading VC games in no time.  The ""Virtual Console"" itself is almost enough reason to buy this machine.  I absolutely love being able to play the games that I grew up playing, and that's a lot because I've been gaming since I was three.  Make sure you get Punch Out and A Link To The Past....I can't wait for Ducktales!

Many years ago I enjoyed video games, but got away from it.  This year for Christmas I thought it would be fun to give it a try again.  A few days after Christmas I first picked up the PS3 - someone was just returning it.  The graphics were incredible and it held a lot of promise.  However, it seemed that it was geared more for serious gamers.  After a few weeks I returned it.

I then decided to try the Wii.  It was hard to get - I had to wait in line before the store opened - I felt weird having to do this.  I purchased the Wii and went home to set it up.

Boy was I surprised.  I was blown away.  What a fantastic idea.  The Wii Sports was terrific.  I played for several hours and was in amazement.  The graphics are not as good as the PS3, but while you're playing it doesn't matter (if you have an HD TV get a component?/composite? (whichever the better one is) cable for a much improved picture).  The whole experience is very immersive.

I haven't played many games, but the ones I have so far have been great.  The ability to browse the internet, get weather, and get news are a nice bonus.  I look forward to future offerings.

I am very happy with my decision.  Be sure to pick up an extra remote or two because playing with other people is a blast.  Nintendo has a huge hit on its hands with the Wii.  For about $250 it is very reasonable and a great way to add some fun into your life.  Everyone is busy and this a great way to take some time to have fun alone or with others.  I don't think it will get old as new and more imagine games come along.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_225?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=225&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We use it all the time. It brings the entire family together, multi generations. My kids love it, my friends love it, our parents love it, even our 90 year old Grandmother loved it.
The game selections are endless, there is something for everyone. Little kids, teens and adults. The applications are amazing too. Not only is it great fun, you can use it to get in shape too with games like Wii fit, or even Dance Dance Revolution.

The games were so limited, it seemed everything cool was coming out for either the PS2, the Xbox, or both (and not the Gamecube), and the proprietary titles (Mario Kart, Zelda, etc), great as they were, were not enough to keep me enthralled with the console.

That having been said, my Wii has rekindled my interest in console gaming.  The unique techology of the controllers, the family-style games, and the virtual console were just appealing to me--so I took the plunge.  And already this thing is well worth the price (and it is the cheapest of this generation of consoles).

Most of the great Wii games I've encountered so far are more appealing to either a multiplayer or a more casual audience.  I consider myself a hardcore gamer but do most of my gaming on the PC, so this console is perfect when I just want to relax and enjoy a nice, enjoyable game with my family.  My wife, my kids, my parents and friends--almost everyone I know enjoys playing the Wii.  I don't know that this would be my first choice if I were exclusively a console gamer, but as it is it serves my purposes very well.  And it's got many of the non-gamers I know hooked.

One of the great features the Wii offers is the ""virtual console""--the ability to download (for pretty cheap) many older games from Nintendo's earlier consoles, the Sega Genesis, and the TG 16.  This, to me, is a great feature.  While many of these games are not as enjoyable as they once were the nostalgia factor is incredible, and there's nothing quite like downloading the original Zelda for a pittance and spending a few hours messing around with it and just remembering ""the good ol' days.""  And with new titles being released every week or so this is sure to continue to be a great feature of the Wii.

In short: someone looking into this gaming console with the express desire to play very intense, ""hardcore"" games will probably be served better by the XBox 360.  But for anyone who wants an enjoyable gaming experience with high playability and loads of fun I highly recommend the Wii.  The innovative design and enjoyable games will provide countless hours of casual entertainment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_193?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=193&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you want to complain about fastedness of hardware, then get a souped up computer gaming system. Not even the xbox or playstation can compare to that either. For those who were disappointed from ""hype"", then don't blame the console for your own emotional purchase.
Nintendo knew they could NOT compete with graphics and hardware, so they went with interesting  sensor abilities and intuitive game play.
Both my husband and I have been nerdy game players in the past. We've experienced graphics heaven in some of them. Yeah yeah, so the Wii doesn't wow you with it's graphics. I honestly don't care. I KNOW what top notch graphics play is. I'm realistic that this cute system just wasn't meant for that. It makes up for it in affordability and great playability. If you think the Wiimote isn't sensitive enough, Nintendo has created addons to it to remedy it. (not that I've had issue with it).
I have 10 games that are all mostly interesting to play. I'll name off the ones I enjoy if you decide to purchase some with your new console. Super Mario Galaxy, Super Mario Kart, Guitar Hero, Resident Evil, (for the guys) Zelda. IF! you have friends over, this is the best way to go. People at any level can enjoy this game gonsole; the more the merrier. Super Mario Kart is a blast with a couple glasses of wine and few people to lightly haze as you compete!
Moms, don't be discouraged by the gamer's critiques. The REAL gamers would be keeping to their own forums anyway.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_179?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=179&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Ultimately, I sold it.  This review is written from the perspective of a long-time gamer.  I currently own a Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.  If you are new to video games, a casual gamer, or are hopping on the latest fad this may not apply to you.

What's Right:

The control scheme is a breath of fresh air.  It does allow new ways to affect gameplay.  The controller itself is the star, with many unique features such as: Bluetooth connectivity, on-board memory (allows you to take saved ""Miis"" with you), and on-board speaker.  The console itself is compact.  It won't eat up much room around your television.

What's Wrong:

The control scheme works great - for a while.  Eventually you notice that every game uses the same handful of movements over and over again.  This leads to tedious gameplay.  The new control scheme and Wii demographic has pulled unknown developers out of the woodwork looking to make a quick buck.  This has led to a large library of rather poor games.  The system is littered with titles which are mostly a grouping of mini-games.  They tend to be very shallow because of this.  Any deep game will force you to use the Wii Remote and Nunchuck in tandem to simulate a conventional controller in many ways.  You might swing or aim the controller every once and while, but ultimately, any full-featured game will rely upon a rather conventional control scheme.  Unfortunately, it seems that almost all decent titles for the system were created by Nintendo themselves.  Historically, Nintendo doesn't create new and exciting franchises.  This leads to more of the same games you've seen rehashed generation after generation.  Yes, you be playing even more Mario, Metriod, Zelda, etc.  Nintendo's online play is all but nil at this point.  Only a couple of games support online multiplayer and its implementation is extremely poor.

This leads me to the hardware.  There are a few trouble areas.  When the Wii is left in a low-power state for 24 hour internet connectivity (WiiConnect24) the unit itself gets extremely warm.  The sensor bar used to determine the location of the television relative to the Wii Remote can be problematic at times.  It is susceptible to interference and its range can be rather limited - a concern when used with a larger television set.  Additionally, the calibration options for the on-screen cursor are limited to ""Above TV"" and ""Below TV"".  Neither one seems right and a nicer tweaking system would be much appreciated.  The graphics are poor.  Hooking the console up to a nice new HDTV is a giant let-down.  Nintendo's inclusion of composite cables seems antiquated.  Be prepared to purchase additional output cables if you have a new television or you will suffer degraded image quality.

The Bottom Line:

This system was designed for non-gamers and children.  This shows in the lack of processing power, simplified setup options, lack of useful accessories, and limited game library.  While the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 feel like powerful home media centers with feature-rich, deep, and stunning games, the Wii seems like a gimmicky toy.  Perhaps that is its appeal.  It is easily approachable.  Unfortunately, this leads to the fun ending quickly as you realize you've already experienced everything the system is capable of.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_247?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=247&reviewerType=all_reviews"

You really feel like you are actually playing the games in Wii sports (the game that comes with the system).  I am looking to find some different games that we can enjoy as well.

Out of the dozen people that have played it at our house a couple have gotten woozy from the gameplay and controls.  Compared it to watching ""Blair Witch""... so definitely not for those prone to motion sickness.  Beside that the game is quite a workout!

I was fortunate enough to have a friend in the US send me over one of these (I live in the UK), so I promptly called my friends over for some Wii fun when the package arrived.

We must have started playing Wii Sports at about 7pm and didn't stop until about 4am in the morning. A friend had also brought his Xbox 360 which has some lovely high definition visuals, but in all honesty, Rockstar Table Tennis was probably the worst game to put on after playing Wii Sports Tennis - pressing the A button to make the character swing seemed fairly pathetic after Nintendo's motion sensing!

Don't worry about the Wii not being HDTV capable. Sure, it'd be nice if it did, but the quality of the art direction in games is far more important to me than the number of pixels on screen (and take this from me, I'm an HDTV maniac!)

Nintendo shaped the way games are as we know them right now, and after wrongly doubting the DS, I gave them the benefit of the doubt and jumped right in for this.

I couldn't believe how easy and simple the setup was (i.e. AC adapter, sensor bar and A/V input).  However, I didn't know right away that I had to ""sync"" both the Wii remote and the console itself to make said nunchuk/controller work properly.  (The ""sync"" red button is on the back of the remote; you need to take off the battery cover in order to see it!)

The nunchuk and Wii remote felt very natural and smooth once I started using it on a few games.  Some of them require you to use that very combination (example:  LEGO Batman:  The Video Game); other games allow you to use the Wii remote by itself (examples:  New Super Mario Bros. Wii, Sonic & The Secret Rings); and others allow the use of a Classic Controller/Wireless Controller or even with a Nintendo GameCube controller (examples:  Sonic Colors, NIGHTS -- Journey Into Dreams).  But you MUST look at the back of each game box in order to know the differences!  This also applies to the Wii U games (because of the Wii U GamePad).

Naturally, I also have Nintendo GameCube accessibility.  After trying out a few games (Sonic Mega Collection, Mega Man X Collection and The Legend Of Zelda:  Four Swords Adventures to name a few), I quickly realized how much more fun this console really is.  I haven't even gotten to the downloading capabilities yet for the Virtual Console and WiiWare games.  But you can be sure that once I do, Mega Man 9 and 10 will be the first games that I work on!!  However, it would be nice if you could download Sega CD games; I very much crave ""Sonic CD"" and ""Shining Force CD"".  :)

In the meantime, here are a few Wii titles that I STRONGLY recommend to others:

Namco Museum Remix
Metal Slug Anthology
Super Mario All-Stars:  Limited Edition
The Legend Of Zelda:  Skyward Sword
Metroid Prime Trilogy
Kirby's Dream Collection:  20th Anniversary Edition

I have fond memories of my original Nintendo and playing Super Mario Brothers and Duck Hunt back in the day. It has taken me 14 months to finally get my hands on a Nintendo Wii and I am very happy that I own one.

I'd like to start off my review by stating that I bought the Nintendo Wii primarily for its Virtual Console feature. I have long since abandoned my Nintendo, Super Nintendo, and Sega Genesis consoles. Those were the consoles I owned throughout my childhood; the Virtual Console feature would allow me to go back and get back in touch with my childhood. I have recently purchased classic games such as Super Mario 3, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Super Metroid, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Donkey Kong Country; this was a wonderful idea on Nintendo's part!

I do agree with some users who say that this system is grossly underpowered when compared to its big brothers, the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. When playing on an HDTV, the Nintendo Wii just doesn't stack up. I also agree that although the $250 price point is lower than the competition, you need to add many accessories (component cables, Nunchuk, Classic Controller, etc) to get less features than the competition. In all honesty, this console isn't cheap at all...I actually think that the PS3 is a much better value, but that's a whole different story.

I am satisfied with my Nintendo Wii because I do NOT regard it as my primary gaming console. I am proud to announce that my PlayStation 3 is my gaming console of choice. However, the Nintendo Wii is a perfect compliment for my PS3. Sometimes I just want to play some old school 16-bit classic games...Sometimes the simplicity of the older games is what I am looking for. I love the fact that the Wii is completely compatible with Nintendo Gamecube games. There are a couple of fantastic Gamecube exclusive games that I missed playing; now I have the opportunity to play these games at a low price!

Games developed on the Nintendo Wii generally force you to be more ""involved"" in the game. Wii Sports is obviously the best example of this, but I also like to use the example of Tiger Woods Golf. The console brings people together and that's what games are supposed to do. Compared to a PS3, the Nintendo Wii is far less intimidating to the average person.

Nintendo has proven time and time again that they are the best game developers in the business. Yes, they reuse a lot of their franchises over and over and over, but they always find a way to come up with such polished and such well designed products. Nintendo console exclusives have won numerous Game of the Year awards in the past couple of years. Some examples are: Super Mario Galaxy, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Resident Evil 4, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and Metroid Prime. Super Smash Brothers Brawl should also be an excellent exclusive title.

I would argue that the overwhelming majority of games on the Nintendo Wii are mediocre at best. BUT...as I stated above, the Nintendo Wii is home to, and is backwards compatible with some of the best games of all-time. In this case, I preach quality over quantity with respect to the games.

Yes, the controller maybe gimmicky. Yes, the graphics are really poor in comparison to the competition. Yes, Nintendo reuses the same franchises over and over and over. Does that make the games any less fun? The answer is a resounding NO!

Nintendo has proven that it has struck a chord with the casual gaming market with the Wii. It offers a different type of video game experience and in many ways, that's a refreshing thing. We're also talking about Nintendo here...these guys simply know how to make fantastic video games with or without third party support. These guys aren't going anywhere, anytime soon so expect to see at least 2-3 AAA quality games per year. For me, that's more than enough.

For me, the Nintendo Wii is a perfect compliment to my PS3. In fact, I traded my Xbox 360 for a Nintendo Wii primarily because of the Virtual Console feature and the occasional AAA exclusive.

I wouldn't necessarily advise people to get a Nintendo Wii as a primary console because I don't think it is the best console on the market (PS3), but as sales show, it succeeds with casual gamers and in many ways, also succeeds with this hardcore gamer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_224?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=224&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But what can the 917th reviewer add that the first 916 haven't already covered?  I can add the reasons why I held off getting this system for so long and I can explain why those fears were completely overblown, in case you've had the same concerns.

I held off exploring the Wii for two big reasons.  #1, I was afraid the controls would suck, and #2, the array of controllers and other peripherals was daunting.

#1:  The controllers don't suck.

When the Wii first game out, I tried 2 minutes of a golf demo and found the controls difficult to use.  I was used to button-based controllers from competing console systems.  For example, with Mario Golf on the GameCube, I could hit a perfect drive easily.  There was skill involved, but not a lot of skill -- you setup your shot, then pressed the buttons with the correct timing, and the ball went where you wanted it to.  But with the Wii golf demo, skill was much more important, and I was unable to hit a perfect shot.  This 2-minute experience was a bad first impression, and lead me to believe that Wii controllers would be difficult to master, imprecise, and frustrating.  It also wasn't clear if I could ""bypass"" the new controllers and still use my old button-based controllers -- but more on this in point #2 below.

Fears of frustrating controllers kept me from buying a Wii for a year, but turned out to be completely overblown.  For example, Super Mario Galaxy, Mario Party 8, Mercury Meltdown: Revolution, and every other game I've played on the Wii has been no problem to control with the new controllers.  There are occasional quirks, but in no way do the controllers seriously impede gameplay.  To be fair, the fact that the controllers frustrate you maybe 1% of the time is still 0.5% of the time more often than the controllers of other game systems bother you.  But the fact is the new controllers work great and add tremendous new capabilities, which adds a lot to the gaming experience and makes them a lot more fun to use.  (See my reviews of Mario Party 8 and of the Wii Remote Controller for more details.)

#2:  The controllers aren't confusing.

I'd seen a few Wii ads, read a few articles about the Wii, and even did a small amount of web research into the topic of Wii controllers, and still, I wasn't able to learn what I thought I needed to know.  This again kept me away from the Wii for a long time.  Specifically, I wanted to know what controllers I truly needed for the games I had in mind and the number of players I had in mind, how the controllers worked together, if I could use my old GameCube controllers to save money on peripherals or if I didn't like the way the Wii controllers behaved, if the controllers would cause wireless interference in my wireless-heavy house, etc. etc..  I even had a very basic, stupid question which was hard to find an answer to without asking someone who had played a Wii before:  what is the game controller, is it that thing they call the ""Wii Remote"" that looks like a TV remote control?

The short of it is that, again, these fears were completely overblown.  It's very easy to learn how to use any of the controllers in just a few minutes usage, they're extremely intuitive.  It's also trivially easy to understand the array of peripherals/controllers once you start using the system, plus, it's trivially easy to understand what controllers you need to play a game -- just look on the back of the box and there's a clear diagram.  If you're holding off getting a Wii because of this, don't hold off, just start with the basic package and you won't be disappointed.

But I will also take this opportunity to demystify the controller situation.

The primary game controller for the Wii is in fact the Wii Remote.  This threw me off because it doesn't look like a controller.  It is.  In fact, it's a hybrid between a classic game controller and a remote control (e.g. like a TV's remote control).  The Wii Remote has features of a remote control (e.g. you can turn on and off your system with it, and oftentimes you point it at the TV to use it), and it has features of a game controller (e.g. it has a ""plus""-shaped direction pad and 2 action buttons).  The Wii Remote is also loaded with other features you may not be used to in either a remote control or game controller:  wireless connection, automatic player number selection, rumble, a speaker, memory (to hold your Wii profile), a port to plug in extra devices, tilt-sensing, motion-sensing, and pointing capabilities.  It's quite a remarkable device, when you realize how much technology is jammed in there and for how little it costs.  In any case, the Wii Remote is the primary game controller, and you will definitely need 1 per player to play Wii games, up to a maximum of 4.

The Wii Remote neither causes nor suffers from any wireless interference that I've been able to detect.  I have 802.11n and 802.11g networks in my house.

You cannot ""bypass"" the Wii Remote controller -- you will definitely need 1 for each player to play any Wii games.

GameCube controllers are required to play GameCube games.  Wii controllers are required to play Wii games.  Likewise, GameCube memory cards only work with GameCube games.  The Wii has a hard drive so doesn't need a memory card, but if you do want to backup or transport your saved games, you can use a standard SD memory card.  Yes, the Wii will play GameCube games, but you need all your old GameCube controllers and peripherals to do so.  The two systems don't intermix.  Yes, this is kind of lame from the standpoint of ""controller clutter"", but at least the system is backwards compatible, and when you see how profoundly different the controller systems are, it's no wonder they can't interchange.  (Caveat:  I haven't tried playing any GameCube games on my Wii yet, but this info is all in the Wii manual.)

There are 2 common ""satellite"" controllers or add-ons that can plug into the primary controller (aka Wii Remote).  These are the ""Wii nunchuk"" and the ""Wii classic controller"".  These add-on controllers cannot function by themselves and must be plugged into a Wii Remote to function.  Both add-on controllers are for use by the same player who is using the Wii Remote, though in some cases you may just put the Wii Remote in your lap and use the add-on controller exclusively (e.g. when using the Wii classic contoller to play Geometry Wars:  Galaxies).

Most Wii games just use the Wii Remote.  Some games optionally support an add-on controller and some games require an add-on controller.  When buying a game in person, check the back of the box, upper right corner, and it will tell you which controllers are required and which are optionally supported.  When buying a game on Amazon, make sure to check which controllers you need to play the game (you may have to hunt).

If this all sounds too confusing, ""don't panic!""  I assure you, it all makes complete sense as soon as you start using the system.  In fact, the games themselves show you visually which controllers to use and how to use them.  You can just start with the standard Wii package itself (which comes with 1 Wii Remote), and you'll be fine.  Or you can take my personal recommendation, which is to buy (a) the Wii console itself which comes with 1 Wii Remote, (b) a 2nd Wii Remote bundled with Wii Play, (c) 1 Wii nunchuk, and (d) Super Mario Galaxy (because it's one of the best video games ever made).  :^)

Bottom line: don't avoid buying a Wii because you're concerned about the funky new controllers or you'll be missing out on an excellent video gaming experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_176?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=176&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The graphics may not be like the XBox 360 or PS3 but the fun factor is there. Games like Super Mario Party 8 and Big Brain Acadamy can bring many hours of play time enjoyment with friends and family. The size of the Wii is small so I place it on top of my DVD player.

If you're looking for a Wii I highly recommend calling Best Buy and ask them when it's going to come out and be prepared to wait in line for a couple of hours or more.

I also recommend picking up Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Party 8.

The Wii only comes with one Wii Remote and a Nunchuk. I recommend picking up a 2nd Wii remote and nunchuk.

Pros: Fun Factor! Low cost! Small Size Built in Wireless Internet
Cons: Way too hard to find. Should come with a 2nd Wii Remote.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bouht the Playstation 3 first for my young grandchildren in the belief that I was getting a Blu-Ray player at a good price with game console almost for free. And that is kind of true, though you can now by a Wii and a good Blu-Ray player for little more than the cost of a Playstation 3.

  There is no question tht the Playstation 3 is technologically superior to the Wii and vastly so. But the Playstation 3 is designed for the hardcore gamer contingent, males between the ages of 15 - 24. The games reflect this with an emphasis on violence, gore and sex.

  The Nintendo Wii on the other hand is focused on the family. I get just as much fun out of the Wii as my grandchildren - and that is extremely important. I suspect that the Wii's 4 to 1 sales ratio over the Playstation 3 is largely due to this.

  Hardcore gamers complain that their favorite violent games are available on the Wii or that they can't be displayed at 1080p. So what? MarioKart is no less fun because it displays at 480p. The hardcore gamers complain that there is no online play. Well, duh, when the kids are very young (or maybe have concerned parents if they are older), you don't want online play.

  The Wii controllers are acts of genius. They exercise more than the thumbs.

  Game selection is broad if you don't depend on a diet of mindless violence, gore and make-believe sex.

  The Wii is what it says it is: a game console that provides fun for the entire family and even across generations. I love it, the grandkids love it. The Playstation 3 gathers dust, as it should. As the kids get older, I'll migrate them the Xbox, not the Sony.

  But for the next few years, the Nintendo Wii is just perfect.

I have mine connected to a wireless router which was very easy to do.  You have to have your wireless network key to connect, but that is the hardest part, finding the network key. LOL.. I can check temperature around the world and get 5 day forecast for US locations. I can read the current national and international news, which I really like.  Updates are made via the Wii Connect24, so I always have the most updated system.

The best part is playing Wii Sports. I love all the sports and I think Golf and Tennis are my favorites. I am getting pretty good at bowling, too, 213 is my highest score so far, but I keep improving.  I have to say that I work up a sweat playing the games. It is good to have one hour out of the day that I am not watching TV.  I love moving around and playing the games.

I also purchased Wii Fit Plus, which is GREAT.  It keeps track of my BMI, weight, Wii Fit age, and I can add activity points for the other things I do, like my morning walk or sometimes I swim, so I get credit for those activities.  I can say that my balance was way off at the beginning and I am 25 days into it and my balance is improving.

My weight loss efforts are complimented by Wii Sports and Wii Fit Plus.  My core strength is improving, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I am not a video game person, although I do enjoy playing occasionally.  Got one of these on a fluke and love it.  A totally different experience than playing with the standard joystick found on other systems.  A great selection of games you won't find anywhere else, including a catalog you can download from online.  Many games also give you the ability to compete online, which adds to the fun.  There are also a lot of older games, from other systems, available for just a few bucks.

If you are somebody who is looking for great graphics, this doesn't have the strongest you'll find, but it's hardly ""poor graphics"" or anything like you'd see on old school systems like Atari or Coleco Vision.

If you're looking for something different, this is a very fun system.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_225?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=225&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My husband is the most proficient with it, as he grew up on one of the old Nintendo systems (NES??).  I'm doing pretty good with Wii Sports and the Wii Play games, and even our 5 year old daughter is holding her own on several of the games.  We plan to add some more games to our collection - looking forward to the release of Wii Fit in (supposedly) May - which will give us even more playing options.

I do recommend getting at least 1 more Wii-mote and Nunchuk combo so more than one person can play at a time.  Also, if you have the option, connecting it to the Internet is a neat option.  We have fun with the Everybody Votes channel, I like reading the various news stories, and of course there's the option of buying some of the classic Nintendo games.

I like that on the Wii, you can have channels.  So you don't have to put the disk in.  All you have to do is pick a game.  That way, you can play games really fast, without the hassle.

My only complaint about the Wii is the remotes.  The remotes are sometimes very hard to use, especially for little kids.  That's really the only bad thing about it.

Once we were having a family party.  We turned on the Wii for fun. The little kids were having so much fun with the bowling.  After awhile they started running before they bowled.  Another time we wanted to play the Wii at my grandma's house, but she only has two controllers.  So we ran home and got two more, from our house.  All we had to do was push the reset button, then we could play.

The Wii is for older kids and adults.  Really little kids always have trouble with the remotes.  So if you have little kids, then you shouldn't buy this.  A connect is easier for them, because it doesn't have remotes.  But for older kids and adults, it's more of a challenge, so its funner.  Overall this product is a really fun game system, that I enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_185?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=185&reviewerType=all_reviews"

First the good points

-very family friendly :
 my father never in my gaming years asked to try out a game except for GT4 on the PS2 just because he wanted to try out the GT force with the Wii he actually enjoyed it for  the  time  he  tried it.

-tracking :
It has a schedule or notes that shows what games were played  at what time and for how long nice feature for concerned parents.

-huge library of games:
  The Wii has a lot of titles to chose from it has something for everyone.

-motion sensing:
The motion sensing  is what makes the Wii  special, games like wario ware is why you bought the wii for.

-no HDTV required:
This will look  good on a normal TV not supposed to be on HD.

For the bad points:

-no support for larger  than 2 gig SD cards.
This is not really a huge unless you buy a lot of wiiware and classics from the store I have yet to use up my Wii's space, but what pisses me off the fact that it's not written in the owners I had to find out the hard way by buying  the card first good thing I have other electronics that I can use the card in.

-Too much games:
I said the good thing it has a lot of games but only a small margin are really worth playing most are a waste of money. And  most good titles  are from Nintendo or you already have it on a pervious generation console.

-weak online gaming:
If online gaming is one of the features you cherish you will be hugely disappointed the online is so restricted that it is painful to do so but it is good if you have kids and want to control there playing.

-A LOT OF WIRES:
 This thing is like a spider web wires and wires you could buy wireless equipment.

-No HD out of the box:
I had to buy a component cable so I can view a less annoying version of it on my 46"" tv the thing looks unbelievably terrible on a HD TV max output is 480P but after spending time with the XBOX360 and the PlayStation 3 , I can't dismiss this point even though they say it's in a different market high definition is the new standard and Nintendo faild in this one.

-Dust collector:
The is the kind of system that you are a happy with it in the first few days or weeks but it losses its glamour after you spend some time playing it. I just gets boring and frustrating with time I just stoped playing it even though I was playing Mario paper but it just does not have the feeling of the 360 and the ps3 of calling you to play.

-Motion sensing:
Some time when playing the motion sensing is just not accurate you move and the thing just does not register any movement saying its accurate is just miss leading

  I have all three next generation systems and I like all three but i find myself playing the Wii less than the other two i just feel that its like the gamecube but with different look and added bigger discs and motion sensing capability.

 If you are looking for something simple and a quick way for having fun and the whole family will enjoy the Wii is a good choice. But if you are looking for a great visual feast,online gaming, quality games and want to upgrade from the PS2 or the XBOX, the 360 and/or the PS3 are what you are looking for i just feel they offer more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_235?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=235&reviewerType=all_reviews"

For many, it's about better graphics, better hardware. That's all great and fine, but Nintendo took a brave, new step in this ""next-gen"" world and made gameplay into something completely different. Unlike Sony and Microsoft, it dared think outside the box, literally and metaphorically, transforming gameplay into something completely different.

For a while, I was worried that the Wii would disappoint, especially this whole motion-sensor feature. Sometimes you see something on an ad and you think it's like a McDonald's commercial where you unwrap the product and find it a tad different from what the ad suggested. Well, after having tried it out at home, I can say it's everything I thought it would be.

The motion-sensor works SEAMLESSLY. It wasn't clumsy, or weird, or clunky in any way. Granted, I haven't tried all the games I ordered, just Zelda, and played with the system a little, but I must say I'm impressed.

I'm not a ""Nintendo fan boy"" or anything. Just a happy consumer. I think Wii is going to be huge. If you haven't had a chance to get one, I suggested go NOW. It'll be the next iPod.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_189?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=189&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I don't think anyone is going to disagree with that.  The great thing is, that it has the potential to be even more fun than it is!  As game makers make games tailored to the new control system, I'm sure it will get even better, although it works really well as it is right now.

The reason I gave an overall rating of 4 stars is because of the graphics.  Yes, I knew going in that the graphics wouldn't be all that great, but I was still expecting something more than what I'm getting so far.  However, I'm sure that will also improve as time goes on.  I guess the first round of games (or at least the ones I have - Zelda and Tony Hawk) aren't tailor made for the system (I know Zelda's graphics supposedly look the same on the Gamecube).  But as games are made specifically for the Wii, I'm sure they will look better.

Regardless, this is the most fun I've ever had playing video games.  Nintendo is really onto something here.  And from what I've heard, their next generation system will focus more on graphics than this one.  So if you combine fun gameplay with great graphics on the next Nintendo system, you could be looking at the best video game system ever!  I can't wait!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_201?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=201&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Have now owned all three of the next generation consoles. Had an Xbox 360 first. The graphics and games were great, however, very noisy and unreliable. Most of the ""good"" games are M or MA rated and pretty much ""solo player"" games. Sold the Xbox 360 on eBay after upgrading our TV which included a PS3. The PS3 is great. Fantastic graphics, games & as a media centre including Blue-Ray it rates A +++. However, my wife did not like our 5 year old son playing on it as he became very ""self absorbed"" in the games. So we got a Wii. WOW!!! Set-up could not have been easier. Normally after opening these well marketed & packaged boxes I am all cables & settings. It takes ages to get up and running and then there is always some set-up issue. Not with the Wii. After plugging it into our TV it just worked. And then we played. Not just my 5 year old. Not just me. But my wife too!! I have never played a video game standing up and then sweating afterwards. THIS IS FUN!! Not at all frustrating like some video games can be. They have nailed the whole package in my opinion. The Wi-Fi worked out of the box. The controller is genius. Sure the graphics are not Xbox 360 or PS3, however, they are still pretty good and quite impressive in games like de Blob. The Wii Console also looks great, is small, and fits in well with your TV setup. It is also very quite and reliable. Well done Nintendo. Our family is converted & my wife no longer hates video games!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_195?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=195&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Hills","First Console System purchased in years --- very satisfied!!","May 31, 2007","I'm the mom of 3 and we have a die hard pc gamer in the family (16 yo male) who couldn't fathom owning a console. Last console we purchased was a PS1 and it's been collecting dust for years. Him and his PC, Nvidia 7900, and BF2 and all that...no way a console would ever measure up.

So, I bought this for a wedding anniversary present for me and hubby but let me tell you, the whole family has had a lot of fun with this. It has something for everyone. My daughter plays old skool Sonic the Hedgehog (we had a Sega prior to the PS1) and my son loves the bundled Sports that came with the console. He's had his friends come over for the day and they have a blast with it - bowling and baseball is extremely popular. Tennis can be quite a workout. I just downloaded Galaga - thanks to the ability to purchase wii points and d/l games thru the console. Galaga is a game I played as a teen. We have a wifi router so connecting to the internet using the builtin wifi was easy. You can check your email and view YouTube among other things.

If you are not sure you'd use this or like it, I suggest you buy the console and included Sports game only. That's what I did. I used one of the many in-stock notifiers on the internet and picked one up from Amazon when it came in stock. I didn't want to pay the mega bucks that certain retailers wanted for the mega-bundles. If you end up not enjoying it, you won't have a problem reselling. But if you do love it, it's easy to add the games and accessories you really want. I purchased an extra wii remote (the one that came bundled with the wii play disc) and  classic controller - although in retrospect, I didn't really need a classic controller for the games I downloaded (galaga, and sonic, so far). I also recycled an old 512mb SD card that so far has fit my needs well for the wii.

What can I say...this thing is just plain fun for all ages and not a serious outlay of cash like the PS3 and Xbox. My son and I have an ongoing duel in bowling and I plan to bring it to another adult couple's house for gaming fun.

Note: We have only a 27in TV so more than one player in games like tennis is challenging!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_52?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=52&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This system is the most fun video game experience I've ever had on a home system.  The games that come with it (Wii Sports) are fun and intuitive.  There is barely any learning curve in how to operate a new game.  My brother let me borrow his Call of Duty 3 and it took no time at all to figure out how to move around the environment.  And perhaps it's just me, but actually moving to change directions just feels more natural to me than the old PS or Xbox controllers.

If you're thinking about getting this, do.  It's worth the $200 easy.  Especially if you have younger kids.  There aren't that many games on our PS2 that our younger son can whoop the older, but this system seems to even that out a bit.  And even when they aren't winning they just don't seem to care.  The games are that fun.

If there is any draw back it's one of marketing/packaging.  It really needs to come with two controllers (like they used to back in the day). That's why I'm only giving it 4 instead of 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

No standing in line.

Anyway, I'm really enjoy the system - Wii Sports is a great party game in itself and makes great use of the controller. The Wii remote is easy to use, however I did have to press the Reset button because it stopped working. This problem has only happened once - I hope it was a freak thing.

The channels feature is handy but limited at the moment with just downloaded games, shopping for said downloaded games, Mii channel, internet, weather, news, and a voting channel (which I have yet to download). I heard the channels feature won an award for innovation. It's simple to use and huge possibilities.

I bought one game from the online store and the process was pretty smooth. The games come with online manual (with pictures). You can pause the game, refer to the manual, and continue the game. I wish all games where the way!

No comment on the graphics because I bought the system for fun and unique controller. All I could say is what has already been said already, so read the other guy's review for that info.

It appeals to a wide diversity of people from small children to active seniors; novice to avid gamers.  The console is easy to use and fun to play while potentially giving the user a workout and a more interactive way to play video games with the use of wii sensor remotes.  Although, some of the more advance games (i.e. Mortal Combat, Spyro, TIger Woods) can be tricky to play with the combination of movements and buttons; however, a conventional game remote can be instead of the wii remote making the game easier.  To get the best use out of the Wii, I recommend purchasing a rechargable station for the remotes to save money and get a longer use between recharges.  In addition to games, Wii has many other funtions as well.  For example, internet connection and web browser, Wii store to download various games including original Nintendo games, Aviators (Miis) creation, contests, and sharing, interactive with other Wii consoles (via messages, playing games together), and voting on various polls.

This is a gaming console everyone in the family can gather around and play together.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_186?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=186&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I can't say enough how much fun it is for ALL AGES.
It's fun, gone are the days of ""couch potato sit down and drain your life away"" mode -- the Wii gets our heart rate going, gets our family and friends together and it is WAY TOO MUCH FUN.

I definetly suggest getting Wii Sports & Wii Play for your starter games to get you accustomed to your wii-motes - let go of your inhibitions of looking lame, otherwise you'll lose out on the fun factor.

I've developed quite a huge library of games from fighting, to racing to mini games, and each one is super fun.

I have carpal tunnel so a few of the games tend to aggrivate it, but I've managed to use a carpal tunnel splint to protect my wrist/hand motions.

The Wii is definetly worth all the hype and the games are super fun. It's money well spent. Don't miss out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_214?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=214&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Carter","Let's get back to fun, the way games should be.","January 25, 2007","Okay, first I'd like to address an issue that's been driving me insane for a long time: Why should a video game system be an entire media center? If I want to listen to music or watch movies, I'll watch them on a DVD player or listen to them on my stereo. I buy gaming systems to play video games. That being said, let's move on.

This system is put together beautifully. The graphics may not be up to par with Xbox 360 and PS3, but who cares? I've played all three systems, and the only one that caught me because of enjoyability was the Wii. I got mine on day one, have had no problems, and I can't stop playing.

The games themselves are simple enough that even my grandmother could play, but they're fun. They get you moving, they get you excited, and you have a great time playing. Wii Sports, although graphically simplistic and easy to play, is hours of fun. My best friend and his wife play bowling with my girlfriend and me all the time.

The ability to create Miis (custom avatars you can use in specific games) just makes the game that much more amusing. It's fun to see an on-screen look alike of yourself throwing a base ball at your friend's on-screen bat. Plus, you can get creative. I have a Mii of my dog on there, and it doesn't look too bad, if I do say so myself.

Game Cube compatability is fantastic. I love that they added this feature, because I had no second thoughts about getting rid of mine. That took fifty bucks off the price of the system right there. The only downfall, I wish that Nintendo had made the Game Cube games compatable with the Wii's classic controller. I like that controller's set up much more than the Game Cube's.

The Virtual console is just genious. My personal favorite system of all time is the Super Nintendo, and being able to play NES, SNES, N64, Sega Genesis and Turbo Grafix-16 games all on this system are fantastic. There are only two downfalls to this, one being they only release a few games every week, and I mean a very few (last week it was four games, none really worth while, and this week it was only one, but it was Zelda: A Link to the Past, so I was fine with that), and the second is that you do have to pay for them. If you're like me, and you still have your older systems, you really don't feel like paying five to ten dollars for games that you already have. Still, the prices for these games aren't through the roof, and some of them are definetly worth it.

This system has free internet service. Yes, it's free. It's all wireless, too. If you're not like me, and you don't already have a wireless network in your home, you can easily buy the computer ""piggy-back"" device for the DS. The Wii is compatable with that, and it works the same, for a fraction of the cost of a wireless router. It has a downloadable internet browser, auto update info for free services such as the Weather Channel, News Channel (yet to be updated or available), it keeps track of your game play time for each day you play, easy to use, easy to navigate, and since it's Nintendo, you know the system will be quality and will keep on working.

Sony may have amazing graphics, but they have horrible customer service, and they have a history of unethical business practice and an overall crappy attitude, not to mention they use faulty hardware on a regular basis, so it will save them money. Xbox 360, yeah, it's a really pretty system, and I wouldn't mind owning one in the future, once I won't have to take out a loan to get one. That, and I don't think I trust either Microsoft or Sony until they've had at least a few years to work out the bugs on their hardware so I won't have to be running to them with a broken system every other month. Nintendo, however, has always had amazing customer service, incredible hardware that works until time's end (I still have my original NES from 20 years ago and it still works like the day I got it), and above all, it's got games that are made how they're supposed to be. Fun! If you want enjoyability, this system is the right one for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_222?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=222&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's by far the best value out of all the game consoles for its bundled game and replay worth. It's a great way to get some  exercise on a gloomy or cold day and it keeps me fit. My family spends more time in front of the Wii than in front of the dinner table. For the more hard-core gamers- the Wii does offer some great gaming experiences like metroid and zelda with many more to come in the future. The online capabilities of the wii are phenomenal.

I already have a PS3 that I love, but my son likes to hijack it to play the ""Duckie"" and Locco Rocco games. So now I have my PS3 on my hi-def set and the wii on the much smaller standard 4:3 tv.

I give the wii 4 stars for the package as a whole.  Nice form factor (it takes up very little space when on the vertical stand), and innovative motion-sensing controls that even a toddler can use.  The inclusion of Wii Sports is fantastic, but I am a bit disappointed that I have to purchase the web browser separately (about $5, but it should really be pre-installed).  On a side note, the soft remote jacket makes the wiimote a little bulky for small hands.

The Wii is great for family time, or get-togethers with friends.  It encourages bonding time among the family, as everyone can participate and cheer each other on (my son isn't at the trash talk stage... yet). However, I don't see it getting much use by a single player.  Even my son doesn't spend much time with it unless someone else is around to join in or watch.

Overall, I would say that the Wii is a nice complemtary system to my PS3.  If I only had the Wii, I think I would be a little disappointed  (with no Blu-ray playback, no 1080p, no upscaling of dvds, no divx playback, and no downloadable content for Rock Band).  I am, however, looking forward to what Nintendo and their third party developers come up with that takes advantage of the wiimote control mechanism, as there are only a few titles that interest me at this time.  I'll likely get Wii Fit when it's available (I could use it).  Yes, this is my son's system.  However, this doesn't mean that I can't hijack it for myself from time to time...","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Whereas the ps3 and 360 are trying to make supercomputers affordable ($300-600 and $80 a game just isnt affordable enough for me), and focusing on multi-media functions and extra features, the wii's focus is making an incredible, intuitive, inexpensive, inclusive, and fun gaming experience. I am a technicly minded person, and it takes alot to suprise me or impress me when it comes to technology... and althogh the wii's core isnt more then a beefed up gamecube, i was impressed.

when you take the wii out of the box, the first thing that i noticed is the quality of the packaging and the neat and tidy organization of the parts in the box. The unit itself is suprisingly small and thats important because i dont think its very practical to lug around a 10lb box everytime i want to play a video game at a friends house. Although i only had the basic composite video cables, the video quality was quite good and depends alot on the tv you are using. I have a 63"" samsung dlp tv and the video through the basic cables is perfectly clear and crisp, however on a more inexpensive tv, you are reminded that your only using composite cables. The unit itself is physicly more solid then any game console i have every used, including sturdy hinges on all doors. from when you put the bateries in the controller, and when you easily set up the system, and when you realise the wiimote strap comes pre attached, and the sensor bar already has sticky pads on it, or when you plug in a connectors on the back, you can tell that nintendo tought about lots of details. I just cant stress enough how solid the unit is and you can really tell that its a quality product.

The controller is the most incredible i have ever seen or used. It exceded my expectations as far as responsiveness also because the motion tracking has no delay. the sensor bar is just two sets of flashing infrared led's that the wiimote uses to understand the location and distance of your tv for pointing. When you use the wii sensitivity adjustment tool, you can auctually see what the wiimote is seeing on your tv and it becomes clear that the wiimote auctually has a camera sensor in the front for picking up these signals, as you aim the wiimote at any ifrared emmiting device like a lightbulb or candle the wiimoe auctually sees the signals as if it were looking around. overall the remote has far more advanced triangulation then i originaly thought. The accelerometer's in the wiimote also use the constant force of gravity to know how your holding the wiimote, so that the wii can triangulate exactly how its being held and moved on every possible axis. The pointing relys only on the accelerometers percieved motion of the wiimote and the sensor bar location so that having a different kind or size of tv doesent effect the speed or sensitivity of the wiimotes pointing functions, thats important because it really eliminates alot of possible bugs with the whole system although you wont always physicly be pointing exactly at what you trying to point at on the screen.  The bluetooth has given me no trouble and you dont have to worry about waking the wiimote up because the wii itself will wake up the controler or prompt you to push a button that may confirm something on the screen and at the same time wake up the wiimote without you knowing. The wii can tell you the battery life of the remotes and can adjust the volume out of the speaker. The rumble function makes using the remote more tactile and the feedback is important to make the wii easier to use because the feedback during pointing is helpfull to be more accurate. Although the wiimote's little speaker wont blow you away with quality or loudness, the sounds are not distorted at full volume and it adds an unexpected level of immersion and detail to the wii experience. hearing the racket hit the ball (the sounds are well timed and mix well with the sound from your speakers) and feeling the rumble in the controller just ads another level to the wii experience and makes the games just that much more fun. the nunchuck has the same motion sensing capabilities as the wiimote itself and plugs into the bottom of the wiimote without having to do anything other the plug it in when you want to use it and unplug it when you dont. No other action is required. its all very simple to understand for anyone. Another thing that i never knew but is a greatly appriciated feature is that you never have to reset the system when you want to play a different game or return to the main menu.

Im basing most of my review off of my experience playing wii sports, and an important thing to note is that there is a high level of accuracy in the motion tracking for these games, although golf is probably the least detailed in picking up your motions. when playing bowling, the straightness and twist on your throw all comes into play. When your playing baseball the position of the bat that your charecter is holding is representative of how your auctually holding the wiimote in the air and you can move it freely. in boxing, the motion of your body is sensed when you lean and also the tilt of your hands so that you can punch high, low, swing around, jab, undercut, whatever you do it will be (mostly) acuratly sensed and translated into player motion very responsivly.

Many people have written about the other features of the system and i have written about what impressed me most. The gameplay is so wonderfull that me and just about every one of my friends are playing competitivly for the first time in ages. My friends who have never played a video games before are suddenly immersed and because your not wasting time learning button combinations, you can improve your technique by auctually making a better golf swing, or dodging punches faster, or using your backhand swing in tennis at the right time. And as you get better (and each friend can track there own progress with there own mii charecters) the charecters you play against get more challenging. The gaming experience is so much more intuitive that i can say that anyone who doesent mind standing will enjoy at least one game on the wii to the point that they will want one themselfs. this system is everything i had waited for and far exceded my expectations in every aspect possible.

1) Price is VERY reasonable.  I like to think of it as a suped up GC - with all of the add on features I never got (ethernet ,etc).

2) Remotes ARE AWESOME.  Intiutive - and makes you THINK about the possibilites.  Exercise using the WII!!!

3) Can use previous GC accessories -Thanks for the $$$ saving.  Why would you redesign ""yet another joystick controller"" for the sake of it (or a memory card? - Speed and size - not as important - wireless way more important).  INVENT and focus on breaking new ground.  Again Nintendo nailed it.

4) Easy to setup.  Wirelessly connected in minutes. Registered and online shopping in minutes.  About 10 games to download at launch.  This was COMPLETE thinking on Nintendo's part.

5) You create yourself as Mii and they get to meet people in plaza online - friends etc.  It's like IM - but better packaged and really fun.

6) Nice clean sleek package to play all the previous classic nintendo games,etc.  (gc,n64,supernes,nintendo,tg16 - I have all of those bulky systems and now I can time capsule them - without losing the opportunity to play the best games of those systems).  Imagine the demand for GOLDENEYE and the forums that will allow you to ask for each and every game to download.  Nintendo is genuis ($$$) and while they are out to make a buck - they really make you think its ALL about the gameplay with this system.  PS3 will have horsepower and a boatload of features- but ultimately you need GOOD games and INGENUITY.  REALLY happy with my purchase.

So ONE ""I hope they improve"":

1) Sensor bar - I want a longer cord.  I also want the bar to allow for a movie screen between the sensors and the remotes. Also, an ability to move the sensor around (and adjust the game setup to account for where its located -like a projector).  I imagine they will get an accesory for this.

Go get one!  Now...the moment is here.. I'm off to try Zelda...","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_221?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=221&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Neither of us has particularly been involved in any way with video games since our teens. That all changed when we saw the Nintendo Wii being used at a family get together.

It was one of the best times in years that we spent as an entire family and is a must have.

We are not gamers, just middle-aged people looking for alternatives to outdoor exercise in crummy or cold weather. He loves the tennis. We play each other sometimes, or he plays tennis himself and I use the Fit Plus.  Bowling is a hoot (I swear there's a Dude-like avatar) and baseball gives you a pretty good workout (they all do if you want them to). The extra remote is essential if you want to play together.

The Wii is a nice change from the Xbox 360 and PS3 (high priced alternatives). Yes the graphics of the Xbox 360 and PS3 are no question the best but the Wii has the motion sensor. Almost like a virtual reality setting. The added feature is the possible workout you get while playing the games. I have been playing the Wii Sports and my arms actually hurt the next day and playing them for an hour makes you sweeat enough to ""think"" you did a workout. Not bad for someone who has zero time to go to the gym.
 The graphics are basic but they look nice on a LCD TV. I play mine on a 42"" LCD Sharp Aquos and it's amazing. The sound is great.

Still, after 5+ years, the Wii  still stands as a friendly-to-all type of a console. Family, friends, everyone can enjoy playing Wii games together. In the past, and still presently, the emphasis was on the individual gamer and the online experience. The Wii has many games that bond family and friends together, as well as provide an online experience.

What you should know:

- Many games on the Wii (at least produced after the Wii's release), are motion based. However, be wary that some games are not fully motion based. Generally, the motion detection is good, with some awkward hiccups here and there.

- You can play older Gamecube games on the Wii. I love this feature! I've found myself browsing in my local Gamestop for games I've already wanted to try, but didn't get a chance to. You can also connect the gamecube controller to the Wii, as well as use the Wii's new gamepad or other companies' Wii-compatiable gamepads.

- The graphics are bad. I can't put it any differently. I can tell you that it's okay that the graphics are nowhere near modern day technology/standard, but it's not. It's one of the only flaws of this machine. You'd think that by 2006, Nintendo would know how to incorporate better graphics and fun gaming experience together. However, I'd give Nintendo a break because they spent A LOT of money on research for bringing motion gaming to the general public.

- The internet browsing, picture viewer, among other Wii menu apps, are very nice. I enjoy watching videos on the Wii browser.

My experience:

- I love playing games on the Wii that are of multiplayer nature. Everyone has such a blast. The bad graphics actually make the experience enjoyable, funny, hilarious, light-hearted, ironically. There are games that are Nintendo exclusive like Super Smash Bros. Brawl and New Super Mario Bros. Wii. Mario Kart is also a blast. It's unlike any other gaming experience. These games are instant classics, although it's only been just a few years.

- Get your butts off the couch! Gone are just sitting down and exercising your eyes, thumbs, and fingers. You can now get up and do simple but addictive sport games like Wii Sports, exercise with Wii Fit Plus - Software Only and even dance with Zumba Fitness. XBOX and PS3 just started catching on, but the Wii remains the most ahead of the curve right now.

- I like the interface of the menu, the little intricacies like the sounds, loading icon, etc. etc. Everything feels so happy, delightful, and soft. It's hard to put in words, but the Wii feels friendly to interact with.

Bottom Line:

- The Wii is the first to introduce the motion style of gaming, and still is the best at doing so. With updates of the Wii Remote Plus - Black and the addition of the Wii Fit with Balance Board shows that the Wii is willing to make updates to continue to improve the gaming experience.

- There are much more of a variety of games since the introduction of the Wii. You'll see shooting games, Movie-themed games, sports games, children's games, etc. etc.

- 2-4 Multiplayer at its best. Whichever games you decide to play with your friends and loves ones, you'll be sure to have an enjoyable time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_174?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=174&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Chartier","Greatest game system ever!","November 18, 2008","I'm sure there are plenty enough reviews that there is nothing new I'm going to say, so I'll try to make it short.

I just recently bought a Wii. I have had an Xbox 360 for a few years and it, frankly, has not done much for me. I play it for about a month, then put it down for 6 months. A few games might draw me in, but the game system doesn't draw me in.

If you want long involved games that take months to complete, then Xbox or Playstation is more your cup of tea. If you are not a big time gamer and just like short simple type games, then Wii is your cup of tea.

More than that though....it is a whole new concept that gets you up and off your butt. There is something different about the ability to really do the game actions rather than just holding a controller and pressing buttons. I love holding the controller like the handle of a bat and swinging it when the ball comes on the screen.

Bell","Wii gamingg system","November 17, 2007","The Wii gaming console is the most exciting gaming device in this decade.  It brings families together by involving them into the action of the various games it plays.  Unlike most video games, the Wii transports its players into the action of the games by using the remotes like you would the various implements of the real live game, such as, a tennis racket, a bat, a golf club, etc.  The beauty of the bowling game makes you feel like you're actually bowling (and your score truly reflects how you actually bowl in reality, be it good or bad!!).  Boxing brings you ""out of the corner"" and gets you to physically swinging your arms, as you jab and strike, and your remote picks these movements up and translates them into boxing the video representation of your opponent.  Gone are the sedentary days of former video gamers.  Get in where the action is.

Do you want flashy graphics? Look elsewhere. Do you want fun? Find it here, for a price that's easy on the pocketbook.

Nintendo has always been about style. The Wii capitalizes on this. I hope the controller is more than a mere hook, but even if it is, what a hook! There is a great synergy (stupid word, I know, but descriptive in this case) between the launch games and the system, something which cannot be said for the bloated PS3. And there is enough novelty here to make it a good alternative to the X-Box 2 (or whatever it's called), which seems now to be hitting its stride.

""Zelda"" is a great game. There is a bit of a learning curve for the controller, as the X-Box afficionado reported. Indeed, it took me a whole 5 minutes to get comfortable with it. And Wii sports is an excellent package - that comes with the system.

Don't overpay, though - I just picked mine up yesterday, and they are beginning to hit the stores. Amazon will have theirs soon, and not for the bloated 500 bucks some people here seem to think they'll get after Christmas.

To sum it up, Wii is the most fun system out there at the moment. Ultimately, its lack of processing power will hurt it in the long run, methinks, but for the pricetag and the initial launch, it is the big winner. Happy gaming!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_181?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=181&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It took me several months to locate this system in a store. The best advise I can give anyone is to not buy this system online. The entire Nintendo Wii system only costs 250 dollars. Any true retail store will sell it to any individual for 250 dollars. Most of the people here want 400 dollars or more. If you buy the system online your going to get ripped off. I'm not going to tell anyone how to get one in the stores. If one is smart enough then one can figure it out on their own. These are the people who buy it before you can get to it, and then sell it back to you for a lot more. My best advice is to just be patient. Either go look for one in the stores, or wait until next year when the demand is not so high.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_232?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=232&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have listed some positive and downfalls about the Wii below:

Positive side:
1.The Virtual Console (Nintendo's online store): You can download all the old 80's games, Super Mario Bros., Donkey Kong, etc.
2.The remote uses hand motion as a form of controlling the character (easy to use)
3.You can use all of your Game Cube stuff, such as controllers, memory sticks, and games.
4.Graphics are great! (no PS3 graphics, but the entertainment excess the default)
5.Nintendo has an online internet setup with News, store, and internet searching; no mouse or computer desk required, search with the wireless remote from your love seat.

Some downfalls:
1.Wii has only 512MB internal memory, so you're going to have to purchase a Scan Disk card for storing extra memory later. (I got 1GB for $[...] at Amazon, which I use just for my Virtual Console games)
2.Not all games (non-Nintendo) are setup to use the Wii remote perfectly such as Call of Duty 3.  You also need the classic controller or game cube controller to play the old games.
3.Internet online sells.  Recommendation: purchase the Wii system at a retail store or a known company ($[...]).  I have been seeing sells for over $[...] just for the console alone.  My total was $[...] with an extra controller, 1GB SD disk, Zelda, and a warranty.  I also have been renting my games to see if I like them first.

The games are also cheaper.  The graphics aren't as good as the other consoles, but they're still pretty good.  What makes the Wii so fun, besides the large number of fun games you can play, is the motion.  Some games don't make very good use of the motion, but some games are just so much different than games in the past.  The ""Super Mario Galaxy"" games are great to play to see what you can do with motion.  ""Okami"" is another great game where you use the Wii remote to draw, and ""Metroid Prime 3"" makes you feel like you're really in the game the way both the remote and nunchuk is used.  Not only are there a lot of fun Wii games, but the Wii can play GameCube games and also can download Nintendo, Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, and I think Sega games, as well.  It can't get all of the games, I think, but it probably can get the main ones, at least.  The Wii can also get Netflix, which is convenient.
The controllers are wireless, of course, and have sound, too, which I think isn't necessary and probably makes the batteries go out faster.  The batteries last about a month for me, but it could be more or less depending on how much you play.  Some games are played with just the remote and some are played with the remote and the nunchuk, which I think is fun because it makes the games even more different from each other.  You alo can save your Wii games to the Wii, so you don't need a memory card.  (You do still need a GameCube memory card to play GameCube games and an SD card for the downloaded games and for extra storage, though so far, the Wii has had enough storage for all my games.)
Now you may have heard about all the people that have thrown the remote into the TV screen and wonder how likely this is to happen to you.  This isn't really that likely if you wear the wrist strap and don't go insane with the remote.  I've never gotten close to this happening (I rarely ever swing in the TV's direction anyway, unless you're playing tennis or something), so if you're concerned about losing your grip on the remote and cracking your TV screen, don't worry.  Just be careful.
Anyway, to summarize, the Wii is a very fun console.  There are just so many fun games you can get, even for the older consoles, and the motion makes it even better.  The graphics aren't as good as the competition, but at least the Wii console and games cost less.  There's a reason why the Wii used to be so hard to get.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_174?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=174&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This is so much fun to play.  It is so easy.  My parents who are almost 60 loved playing it.  We spent two weeks over Christmas playing Wii sports (mainly bowling and tennis) and much to my dismay, my mom (who i would call technically challenged) was BETTER than me at some of the sports games.

This console is so much better than the PS3 - as far as enjoyability to be had by all.  We got the Wii and the PS3 at the same time and I have still NOT played the PS3.  (Mostly because I am not interested in any of the games that are out for the PS3 but also because the ease of playing is just not the same.)

I would have gladly paid much more than the $249 that the Wii retails for.  This is a great time to be had by everyone young and old.

Our friends came up on New Years Eve and we spent all night playing with the system. Bowling was great, boxing was great, and baseball was a hit! We even enjoyed playing Wii Play. My friend's husband goes to a gym and says that he felt as though he got more of a workout that he enjoyed than he does at his expensive gym, so now they're looking into getting one.

Review from a longtime Nintendo console buyer","March 20, 2009","I've bought almost every system that Nintendo has put out...the SNES, the N64, the NDS, and now the Wii.  I've had the Wii for over a year.

It's a good system.  I LOVE that you can download the older Nintendo games that I enjoy like the Diddy Kong series.

And I also enjoy several of the Wii games, like Mario Galaxy, Mario Kart, Zelda etc.

But I think my Nintendo console buying days are over.  Why, you may ask?

Because Nintendo ALWAYS puts out a few really good games at the console launch (almost always a Mario and a Zelda) and for a couple of months after.  And then....sucky games abound!!!  Nintendo just can't seem to get it up and keep it up!  I haven't bought a Wii game in months.  I think the last one was Guitar Hero (which, yes ok, is admittedly awesome).

It gets irritating supporting a company that puts out, in my opinion, a majority of substandard games that even my 10 year old nephew won't play.  Nintendo is just so hit and miss.  When I look at game reviews at IGN or Gamespot...the reviews are 6 or below for most Wii releases.  Maybe 1 out of 20 games released gets a great review.

For a gaming console for the casual gaming family?...oh yeah, get the Wii.  They have probably a good dozen games that you can get that will keep you entertained for some time.  And probably a good dozen more kid-friendly games (tho' don't ask me what they are...I haven't been all that interested in the ""My Pretty Pony"" type of games).","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_190?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=190&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But, here, five months after purchase, I have to send it in for repair.  Nintendo tells me the ""card reader"" is likely shot.  It will not read any disc.  I tried their cleaning kit, to no avail. Five months of use.  My old Gamecube lasted six years, sometimes being left on 24 hours a day for weeks.  My Wii, in comparison, was babied, never played more than a few hours.  I will say that Nintendo's customer service seems quite good, and they're repairing it free.  Still, a month without a game console is not fun.

This gaming system is truly revolutional and takes gaming to the next level.  While many will argue that the graphics are not comparable to PS3 or Xbox, this system can hold it's own on what it does have.  This system gets you up off of the couch and puts you into the game like never before.  With this system you have to move, and you often find yourself forgetting that you aren't really performing the action in real life.  With the Sports game that is included, you really feel like you are bowling, or hitting home runs... You swing your arm back just as if you were really bowling, and you hold the Wii Remote like a real baseball bat and swing away!

There are a multitude of games to come for this system and so many of them look promising.  This system is a bargain for the price as the system also features the option to download games of old (NES, SNES, N64, Sega, etc...), the system will have internet browsing very soon, you can send messages (emails) to friends, and it plays Gamecube discs.

This system is easy to use (for most games) and even a person who has never played video games before can pick it up and learn it easily.  It is great for people of all ages no matter how young or old, and it is HIGHLY entertaining!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_218?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=218&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After playing with the Wii for over two weeks now, I can say that this has to be the toy of the year. Forget PS3 and XBox 360 - the Wii for the price is a whole lot of fun and very entertaining.

Although the system doesn't support high end resolution screens and use high end graphic processors, who cares. The idea here hits the nail on the head - develop a moderately priced video gaming system that gives players a rich, engaging experience. It's the handheld controllers that gives the Wii the interactive experience that makes playing games on the system so fun.

Not only that, but the system is backwards compatible with previous consoles. Imagine being able to run NES, TurboGrafix, Nintendo 64, and GameCube games. All those old game cartridges, memory blocks and controllers can still be used. You can also get the Wii wired to the Internet. Simply set your Wii's wireless settings to tap into your wireless router. There, you can go shopping for Nintendo games from the past. Although the selection is small, new games will be added (and yes those that I did purchase did run).

So what's so great about the Wii? Its in the controllers. The wireless Wii remote and the nunchuck take gaming to a new level. Being able to gesture in a more natural way makes the gaming experience so lifelike and real. For example, box like you box, swing the golf club like a hack and even bowl like you normally do. The 3d spatial interpretation of the controller's position really makes this unit so unique.

I was pretty lucky to get a new Wii and I'm sure they are still hard to get this Xmas. For those dying to get one when they come in stock, get it because its a heck of a lot of fun and well worth the price!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_185?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=185&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Hurley","Wii-mote NOT just a novelty.","December 14, 2006","I've spent a week with my Wii and can honestly say it is fantastic.  The controller is not a novelty, it's just a new way to interact with your game.  If we had all started out with a Wii-mote instead of pushing buttons, we would be thinking the idea of going to a non-motion sensing controller was idiotic.  The Wii-mote does take getting used to but it is a lot more fun than pushing buttons.  The biggest difference is that the Wii-mote can tell how hard you want to steer a car or fling a ball, a button can't do this as well.  Anyone waiting to buy a Wii with the idea that they're concerned it's a novelty, don't wait any longer.  I would recommend just buying the Nintendo-written games for now (no third parties) like Excite Truck and Zelda since I don't think the third party games take full advantage of the Wii-mote just yet, especially the sports games.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_227?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=227&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Only on the Wii I can play many games with my wife.  She uses it a lot more than I do.  We primarily use the Wii to play casual games together.  The graphics don't measure up at all to XBox 360 or Playstation 3, but can still be plenty of fun for games where graphics are not important.

I use the Wii for Wii Sports, Wii Fit, Boom Blox, Mario Party, etc.  I find myself using the Wii less and less and my XBox 360 much more now since I more often want to play some deeper, more graphically intensive games.  There far fewer Wii games I am interested than those for other consoles, but the other consoles do not yet have the unique casual game experience that my wife and friends are excited to play.

I still recommend and like the Wii, but it isn't trying to compete with Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 which are entirely different kinds of gaming experiences.  You either want to play some of the casual games with motion controls or you don't.  If you aren't a big fan of Wii Sports, then there is probably little reason to buy a Wii.

Adult friends and family have bought the Wii that would have never bought or played games anymore.  So it definitely has opened games up to them again.  However most of them have significantly decreased their usage of the Wii after the first few months or year, haven't bought new games, or have stopped playing all-together.  So if you don't play and are wondering how long lasting it will be, you probably will not play forever.  But if you want something fun that you can do in a group setting, it is a nice option.

I consider a Wii a replacement for board games.  It is fresher and more exiciting ina group setting than board games for many and can be used once in a while when you want a casual game like that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_187?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=187&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Warshauer","Revolutionary Console","January 4, 2007","After having played through some of Zelda: Twilight Princess and the Wii sports, I have to say that I am thorougly impressed with this console. Physically it is very modern looking and about the size of your average external dvd player. It would fit in well with any entertainment system. But of course the important part is how it plays. Obviously, the best part about the wii is the level of interaction. I'm the kind of gamer that likes to swing my controlers around while I'm playing, so the ability for my motions to actually control the gameplay is wonderful. Might I also add that the remote control combination is the best I have ever played with. I was a little unsure of it at first because it is so different from any other game controller, but everything is very natural and it allows for a great range of motion. It does take a little bit of time to get used to the quirks of the motion sensor, but it comes very quickly. Unfortunately the graphics on the wii are not as good as its rivals. However, what is more important to you, graphics or gameplay? And the graphics on average will be acceptable for 99% of gamers I would expect.

Another plus about the wii is all of the other stuff besides gaming you can do on it. I'm still exploring all the many facets of the console, but there really is a lot available. And I also love the fact that I have access to a whole catalog of classic games on the virtual console. Big plus for nintendo there. And of course, how many other consoles that you have purchased recently come with a free game, and a pretty decent one at that. Overall this is a great system that will meet the needs and desires of the whole family.

Pros:

-Great interatction

-Fun gameplay

-Free game with the system

-access to a bunch of classic games

-Excellent Price point

-Great Remote control combination

Cons:

-Average graphics

-Wii remotes eat batteries","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_182?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=182&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I asked her permission to return it and get a Wii at $100 over retail instead.  I have never regretted that decision.  Even at that price, I could get a few more games (especially cheap used Gamecube gems like Metroid Prime, Super Mario Sunshine, and Zelda Wind Waker).  I was also able to get Zelda Twilight Princess, of which I have barely scratched the surface.  All of these games were made in a way that my 8 y.o. son would enjoy far more than almost any of the dark shooters that XBOX/XBOX 360 library seemed to be dominated with.  After hooking it up, I was amazed at the responsiveness of the Wiimote, the sheer joy of controlling Wii sports, creating Miis for the whole family and the visiting friends of my son, and the intuitive interface of the spinning globe on the silly Forecast channel.  The XBOX 360 may have the adavantage in terms of HD graphics and overwhelming processing power, but it doesn't have the Wiimote, which to me is a far more important advancement.  Don't event talk to me about the PS3.  I've seen black boxes of the $600 Sony dud gathering dust in every store I've visited while on the hunt for a second Wiimote and Nunchuk.  I've never, ever, seen a Wii on sale anywhere.  I'm glad I got mine when I did.  Even a few more weeks with this joyous wonder were worth the extra cash I doled out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_205?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=205&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm a man in my early thirties now, so when I grew up, I grew up on Nintendo.  Sure, there was a bit of Atari action going on a little before that, but when Mario presented his mustached self, I never looked back. That very fact alone has a lot to do with the fondness I now look over Nintendo's latest incarnation; the Wii.  Much has been made over the years about how it's the lesser of the next gen consoles, what with it's subpar graphics and kiddie games.  All of us Nintendo lovers have had to put up with the scene where one of our acquaintances who loves to play Call of Duty asks us if we play on XBox live and we respond, ""No, we have a Wii.""  Suddenly we can see the person begin to look down their noses at us as they begin to talk in a fake superior British accents about how they're sorry that we're stuck with an inferior gaming system and suddenly I feel like I have to apologize that my gaming doesn't fit their standards of gaming.

That's when I have to stop myself, look them in the eye and say ""Yep, stinks to be me.  All those hours of fun I've had playing Mario Galaxies and Zelda and Metroid Primes have obviously been a huge waste of my valuable gaming time.  I see the light.""  Pause to let the sarcasm sink in and go about my business.  Perhaps fire Mario Kart up when I get home.  The point is simply this, going in we knew the Wii wasn't going to have knock out realistic HD graphics.  And frankly, we didn't care.  We believed in Nintendo because of years of top quality games.  The motion controls are fun on the games that do get them right, but if they aren't your thing, most of the time you don't have to use them.  I myself think the motion controls are pretty cool.  Unfortunately, a lot of games didn't realize how to incorporate them and you ended up with a lot of games that degenerated into waggle fests.  But you pick up a game like Metroid Prime 3, where motion controls take an already awesome gaming experience and shoots it to the next level, then it was worth it.

Sure, we saw a lot of sewage drenched filth come out on the system and had to wade through a lot of uninspired junk to find some jewels.  But when we did, wow, how refreshing was it to play those games.  This is an incarnation of Nintendo that has seen three top tier Mario Games, two Legend of Zeldas, and two Metroids.  How many generations of Nintendo consoles can boast that, apart from the original?  And graphics?  They may not have been photo realistic, but the good games that knew how to work with them and give us good art design with vibrant colors really looked great.  Take a look at the Galaxy Marios or even Mario Kart.  You could play a new Ghostbusters game on PS3 or XBox 360 that looked like you were watching a movie, or you could play a version on the Wii that looked like a slick cartoon that made you FEEL like a Ghostbuster.

To me, that's what makes the Wii a success.  The fun of the games.  And yes, they weren't all kiddie games.  Try out the bloody No More Heroes or MadWorld and you'll find some slick no small kids allowed violence you'll be shocked to find on a Nintendo system.  Even first person shooters; while missing the photo real HD graphics, they control like a dream with the Wiimote/Nunchuck combo.  Point and shoot.  Super accurate.  Not everybody is a ""hardcore"" super gamer.  There are some, like me, that grew up on the Nintendo brand that love those original games and love to play the continuation of those series.  And when you throw a game changer like the Wii Sports games, it's like icing on the cake.

I'll never regret getting a Wii.  For someone who didn't game much between about halfway through the N64 years to a couple of years into the Wii lifecycle, it has, in the end, provided me with hours of fun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_174?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=174&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The motion controller and nun-chuck was an innovative idea that attracted customers who had only ever been used to standard control pads. But with the release of PlayStation Move Starter Bundle and Kinect Sensor with Kinect Adventures and Gunstringer Token Code the Wii has lost its unique edge, and since it never offered anything like the PlayStation Trophies or Xbox Achievements the online features are limited to those stupid 'Miis' and the rather dull Wii Store.

The console itself is sturdy but small, and feels more like a toy than something that belongs connected to your home entertainment system, thus making it more likely to be kept in a kid's bedroom. There is no separate audio out and the video connection is, at best, RGB. It has the ability to play GameCube games, which is a huge bonus as there are a lot of hidden gems out there for that system, but they are region-locked, so you can't import otherwise unavailable games from the other countries, ditto for the Wii games themselves. None of the downloadable features are really any good. If I want to load pictures onto a games console the PS3 is more appropriate, plus it also features the ability to save audio and video files, which the Wii doesn't. One of the better features is the aforementioned Wii store, which offers retro Nintendo and Sega games. But they hardly ever update it and the payment system feels like a con.

I really do feel that the reign of the Wii is over. It's a Remora fish swimming in the wake of the bigger consoles. If you're going to invest in something for your kids or for your home theater then leave this be. It's great for a toy if you pick it up cheap, though it will never be a 'main' Xmas or birthday present again. I'm sorry to say it, but unless Nintendo goes HD for their next console, they are finished.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_191?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=191&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This is not a high end graphically intense console and it isn't supposed to be. Too many people are complaining about how 'bad' the graphics are and I'm sorry but if you don't like it you should not have purchased the item (do your research before you spend your money.

With that said the Nintendo Wii is everything it is supposed to be, a fun for all gaming system. Though the graphics are similar to that of the Game cube the Nintendo Wii brings family fun and friends closer together. You may not be able to play your precious Halo 3 on it, but to see your wife bouncing around the room trying to pull off some of the Wario Ware mini-game moves is more than worth the price of the console.

Another great thing about this console is the ability to download old favorites right to the system and have them to play whenever you want, no need to dig through the attic to find that old copy of Mario 64!!

I say Nintendo delivered on their promise of a console that is both fun and great at bringing friends and family together.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_239?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=239&reviewerType=all_reviews"

 The one big thing about the Wii is what everyone knows about, the Wii-mote. The Wii-mote is a new twist on a game controller that makes the system more normal to the world. It looks, and functions like a remote control. Instead of moving an anolog stick up, down, and sideways, you just point the 'mote at the screen, and it moves there. Nintendo uses that function in all their games; example, in zelda, you move the 'mote to swipe your sword, or in a shooter, the 'mote moves the gun cross hairs. If the remote still isen't getting you all giddy and mabey not want to use it, fine, some games are gonna use the Gamecube's controller(Smash Bros. Brawl)

 Next to that, another cool feature is the vitual consol. Virt. console allows you to download any game Nintendo has made(with a internet conection) on a home system, not handheld. The prices are more than stuff from other platforms, like Xbox arcade and whatever Playstation calls their stuff, but it still isen't expensive, the max price is $8. The Wii allows you to play 'cube games, but you can't download it, just stick 'em in. With an internet conection, you can download diffrent channels; theres an weather channel, it gives a 5 day forecast of most cites. Theres a news channel that gives any type of news, from international new to sports and to tech. Theres a photo channel where you can take pics from a digi cam or cell phone and email it.

 Last of all is the Mii's and the free game, Wii Sports. Wii Sports is a free game that comes with the system, it has 5 diffrent sports(bowling, boxing,tennis,baseball,and golf) to play, most of them are gimmicky and not deep at all, but there great to play with parents or grandparents. The Mii's are avatars(or caracatures) that you get to play in Wii Sports and other titles(not all), there fun to make and you can get 'em to resemble celebs.

 The Wii's the hot new thing these days, if you liked, do like, or never played videogames, buy this, there are developers that are making fun games for the hardcore to the never owed a system.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_177?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=177&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But what you are looking at right now is the Wii. Now, I'm sure you've seen the Wii as the number one video on YouTube being smashed to bits by a sledgehammer, but you don't really see how great the system is.

PROS:

-The Controller - The controller is amazing. With very fluid motion, great responde, and full usage in every game, this truly is innovation in the making. Not only does it feature minimal buttons, is wireless, reasonable priced, it also has a speaker on it to get the full surround effect; it even rumbles.

-The Size - This device is not another box to put on your shelf, this thing is tiny. When first shown at E3, people were in awe; and Nintendo one-uped and said that the final one is smaller. I wasn't at E3, but I can tell you, this thing is SMALL. It is about the size of a Tom Clancy hardback, and probably lighter. The controller is also very light.

-Backwards Compatibility - This thing is very backwards compatible. It accepts both the Wii disks and the Gamecubes in a very clean slot loading drive, very Apple-esque if you ask me. Games on both versions load very quickly, and give you the amazing experience. It would have been awesome if Nintendo made the Nunchuk, but I'm happy using the classic controller.

-Wireless Options - Not only does the Wii have bluetooth (controllers) but it also has Wi-Fi, and connects very easily. This is excellent, especially with the Nintendo DS' wireless options.

-Nintendo Arcade - This is probably Nintendo's biggest advantage over Sony, and even Microsoft. As show with how many people got into the Xbox Live Arcade after the Wii's announcement, this is something to reward Nintendo about. You will, over time at least, be able to play every Super Nintendo, NES, Genesis, Nintendo 64, or Turbografix-16 in full. All games at reasonable prices, new and old games can enjoy the experience. This also gives many of the American Wii owners chances to play games that have never been released on this side of the Pacific.

-Design - BEAUTIFUL. With more colors on the way, slot loading drive, and a beautiful finish, this is the best looking out of the three systems by far.

-Price - VERY competitvely priced. You can buy two Wii's, Zelda, a Classic Controller, and a couple of Arcade games for the price of one PS3. At $249, this is the same price as a 30GB iPod, and cheaper than a Razr cell phone.

CONS:

-No HD - It runs at standard 480p, but doesn't run up to 1080's like it's rivals. Nintendo is more about the experience than the graphical appeal, which is why it is considered the weakest. Nintendo has claimed that it can run the Unreal 3.0 engine, but that's something we'll have to wait and see. The graphics look about on par, if not a little better than the original Xbox, but if graphics aren't all you're concerned about, than you'll have a blast.

-No Blu-Ray, HD-DVD, DVD, or CD compatibility - This is not a media device; this is PURE gaming. Nintendo hasn't announced anything, but don't be suprised if extra accessories are on the way.

BOTTOM LINE: This is what Next Generation Gaming is all about. If you are looking for something NEW instead of an improvement on the old formula, than the Wii is your system!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_215?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=215&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This one was bought for my 75 year old mother. The whole extended family, from 2 year olds to 80 year olds enjoy playing Wii games. None of us are true gamers and I think many of the elitist reviews are some sort of video game snobbery. Pretty much everyone, but the 2 year old, is able to instantly play and enjoy all the Wii games. The fitness benefits are also tremendous. There are so many games available that give you a work out while you are having fun. I recommend the Wii to everyone.

Nintendo wii is the only game that combines fun and exercise.
Using the remote controls, you can play with friends and family.

I personally played the wii sports game, and it was one of the best game ever. It was realistic, fun and easy to play.

_PRO_
-combines exercising which no other gaming devices do.
-no violence, or any sexual content that many games have.

_CON_
-might get bored really easily.

Overall: I recommend wii to people who want to have fun and exercise at the same time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Garland","Amazing, simply a pleasure","January 9, 2007","So I was able to order one of these LONG before available and Amazon shipped it to me on the launch date. I had overnight shipping so it came the day after on Monday. Wii haven't stopped playing the system, except for the time when it errors out. Apparently there is an issue out there that is not being talked about very much which is system memory corruption. Nintendo has been very good about sending replacement units and they replaced mine instantly with 2day air shipping. However, my replacement unit was cracked so I got a third replacement which is expected to arrive tomorrow.

Another item that is a bit of a let down that the wireless in this is only 802.11b instead of 802.11g which would have been great as I support only G in my network which is a WDS setup with WPA2 encryption. I""m waiting for the LAN adapter to come out before putting this thing on my network which has been a bummer because I want to use the Wii points to download some stuff.

I'll have to say that all those troubles aside this has been one of the most entertainming gaming systems that I have ever owned.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

FIRST BY LETTING YOU CHOOSE FROM MORE THAN JUST TWO TRAINERS AND NEW EXCERCISES...ALSO YOU CANT EVER DO MORE THAN 6 TWISTS....OTHER EXERCISES LET YOU WORK UP TO OPENING NEW CHALLENGES (FROM SETS OF 10 TO 20), BUT THIS ONE DOES NOT. ALSO, WE'D LIKE MORE OPTIONS AND FLEXIBILITY ON THE PERSONAL TRACKING CHARTS AND CALANDER....YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO IN TO CHANGE YOUR GOALS, ETC MORE READILY, RE-DO STAMPS, ETC...MAKE IT MORE FUN AND INTERACTIVE... ALSO, IF YOU GET INTERUPPTED IN THE MIDDLE OF A WORKOUT, IT WOULD BE NICE TO SIMPLY RESTART THE EXERCISE. YOU ONLY HAVE THE OPTION OF RESET WHICH TAKES YOU ALL THE WAY OUT TO THE Wii PLAZA INSTEAD OF SIMPLY RESTARTING THE EXERCISE AGAIN. THAT KIND OF STINKS. ALSO IF WE ARE TALKING OF IMPROVEMENTS, IT TAKES TOO LONG SOMETIMES TO GET THROUGH THE EXERCISE...MORE TIME IS SPENT WAITING FOR IT TO BEGIN, (IF PEOPLE LIKE THAT, THERE SHOULD BE A PAUSE BUTTON)...AND MORE TIME WAITING TO GET THROUGH ALL THE ""A"" BUTTONS AFTER EACH WORKOUT...THEY SHOULD GO FASTER BECAUSE IT TAKES A FULL HOUR TO DO A 30 MIN WORKOUT. HOWEVER; ALL THAT SAID...OVERALL, IT IS WONDERFUL FOR BEING ABLE TO WORK OUT IN THE PRIVACY OF YOUR OWN HOME WHEN EVER YOU WANT TO AND IN ANY APPAREL YOU DESIRE... AND I FEEL IT IS MORE MOTIVATING THAN VIDEOS SINCE IT KNOWS WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND TELLS YOU IF YOU ARE DOING AGOOD JOB AND IF YOU NEED IMPROVEMENT, BUT IS ENCOURAGING....HOWEVER THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE DIALOUGUE TO THE ENCOURAGING TIPS AND MANY MORE FITNESS TIPS! THE SAME OLD ONES GET PLAYED WHEN IT ASKS IF YOU WANT TO HEAR A FITNESS TIP....ALSO IF YOU GAIN WEIGHT AND IT GIVES YOU A LIST OF REASONS TO SELECT FROM, THE LIST IS VERY LIMITED.

But when I first heard and read about Nintendo's wii, my thoughts started changing.

However the severe shortage of the product and my reluctance to pay a premium kept me from buying the product. We were able to finally buy this product for Christmas this year. This game has become our favorite family past time. Whenever possible the entire family is involved.

I have found Wii sports very addictive and also like the training features. We have just ordered the Guitar Hero III and hope to have more fun. This product is so refreshingly different from the PS and XBox. My son has a lot more physical involvment. There is a lot of jumping moving and arm movement, rather than just the thumbs getting 100% of the exercise.

This is one purchase I will cherish for a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_222?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=222&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My very first system was the NES. I have been wanting a PS3 but was not willing to spend the money to get one. Having a DS lite and also playing party games on friends' Gamecube influenced our wanting a Wii. Of course, the price is much more reasonable as well.

We were lucky enough to get chosen in the Vote drawing. Having it arrive before Christmas was perfect because the whole family was home and could try it out. My 65 year old dad loves the bowling! The Wii is so innovative yet instinctive in its design. With Wii Sports, the movements are the natural motions you would perform if you were really playing. The physical involvement of the games is genius. It is so physical we are actually a little sore from playing! The unexpected consequence of that is we want to take breaks in between. You can get a satisfying gaming experience within an hour, so you're not sucked into spending your whole day playing.

You could just get the system without buying anything else and be happy. One controller works out, though you have to switch each time. You cannot play versus each other without another one. We'll likely get another controller soon. Four days after the system arrived I bought The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess from Target; it was on sale. Zelda is my fiance's favorite Nintendo series and this one does not disappoint.

All my expectations for the Wii have been surpassed and I am always amazed to see what else can be done in the games using the remote. It is just like nothing you have ever played. The whole family will really enjoy this and get a little workout, too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_194?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=194&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My first thought was what are my 57 years old parents going to do with a video game system. We went to their house that afternoon and I was totally amazed. The entire family from 57 to 3 was taking turns bowling.

My husband and I agreed we needed to get one. I couldn't see paying over $500 for it on Ebay, so I called every store withing a 100 mile radius for days until I found one.

I know it is not a tremendous amount of exercise, but it is more exercise than just sitting on the sofa barely moving.

As 'Revolution' gained momentum and more and more information became available my resistance remained strong but my intrigue began to grow. Initially I thought the same as most opposition to the Wii would - too strange, too childish, too different. Then the 'Revolution' became Wii and the buzz began to grow. The game release lists began pouring out and critics began to rave of the new control system. My interest peaked and next thing you know - BAM - I'm waiting in line at Toys R Us in Times Square with my little lady and Santa ends up one of the lucky few who were able to get their hands on a Wii the opening day! I was so pumped that I told her I couldn't wait until Christmas to play so she let me have it as an early Christmas gift! IT IS AWESOME!! I of course started with Wii Sports - bowling is rad! I have it in my basement where my boys and I kick it on Friday nights - you couldn't think of a better system to have - I'm bowling in my basement on Fri nights with cold beer! Friggin sweet! In addition to the freebie Wii Sports I also got Ultimate Alliance and Call of Duty 3! They're so sweet I'm not even going to discuss them now cause I'd get way too pumped!

Finally in November, after waiting out in the cold for 16 hours I was able to get my hands on the Wii and play one.  This is truly what the next revolution in gaming should be.  I think Nintendo did the proper thing by not focusing on graphics and processing power like Microsoft and Sony, but instead changing the way we play.

When I first opened the box at 12:30 a.m. and saw the insides I knew this was a console for everyone.  Everything is laid out in a way to hook it up quickly with little help from instructions.  Within minutes I was swinging a ""racket"" at my TV and trying to move out of the way from jabs at me.  Yes, the graphics are not much better than the Gamecube (which I tink was always better looking than a PS2) but I enjoy everything.

In the end, if you want to have fun playing games, and get out of your life for a while everyday, there is no better way to do it than with this console.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_233?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=233&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Luster","Wii Weeeeeeeeeee","February 11, 2008","I didn't have much desire to ever own any of the arcade style games like this or the Playstation, X Box, et cetera. To me the cost was prohibitive for the games and since you can not use them for other things like work which you can do on a PC. The Wii changed my attitiude. Since my wife asked for a Wii for Christmas I have bought several games and devices to make the overall experience better. I must admit I love playing most of the games myself and some are indeed very physically demanding. I recommend this Wii system to people of all ages and this software runs the gamut of being useful in playing a variety of the games for the Wii. One warning, be sure to clear the area in front of the TV.

The problem isn't the controls strapped to your wrist, it is hitting items on tables with those controls and sending them flying into the TV screen. While bowling with the Wii I launched a TV remote control into my HD Projection TV set and cracked the plexiglass screen. So with the bat, golf club, and tennis racket you run the risk of hitting something into your set. Just be aware of that and clear the area of any hard items. I highly recommend the Wii. Great fun and exercise rolled up into one package.

I own a PS3 and never imagined I would buy the Wii console since the graphics were clearly better on the sony system.

So why do I now own a Wii?  Gameplay fun.  The other systems have excellent features, but often miss on simple gaming and playfulness.  Mario Kart is a great example.  Silly cars shooting turtle shells at one another offers a great setting for new and old gamers.  Everyone who comes to the house can enjoy the game.

Compare that to many of the technical heavy race games on the other systems that focus on realistic graphics and high level controls and the system is not great for newcomers (yet rewarding for those who put the time in).

Head to head games will usually be better on the PS3, but the original and wii specific titles are some of the most fun gaming experiences for groups.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The reason for my review is to beg you not to pay these crazy prices.  Give the system a couple weeks to catch up and the system will be available for its list price of 249.  Better yet do what I did.  Small quantities are showing up at stores locally as of now.  I called my local Game Stop earlier in the week and they said the might have a few later in the week or early next week.  They said the truck comes in every day at 10 and they don't know what will be on it.  I called at 10:30 and they had ""a few"" for sale.  I cut out of work and got to the store 15 minutes later.  There were two other customers in the store, both  buying new Wiis.  I got the last one.

The sports and Wii play games look simple, but are challenging so they keep you interested.  My definite favorite is Dance Dance Revolution hottest party 2, for which you need the dance pad.

Super Fun system for all ages!","March 3, 2007","I FINALLY got a Nintendo Wii after searching everywhere, I found out about craigslist so I read a posting from a guy right down the street from me who was selling the Wii for a very reasonable price. I just got it last night from the seller and I'm loving it! I'm an older gamer, female and I've been a gamer from the 1980's.

The Wii is alot smaller then I realized, it's sleek, unique and cool looking. The Wii-mote, the main remote is comfortable to hold although it took me awhile to know which button does what but I really like it. The Nunchuck control is pretty nice too although the only time I connect to the Wii-mote is for the boxing game in the Sports game that came with the Wii. Yes, there is a game included unlike the other next gen systems! The sensor bar was very easy to set up and the entire setup didn't take long at all. The Wii has two owner manuals so you will definately want to read them to get the most out of your Wii.

I started playing the sports game as soon as I could...this game is INCREDIBLE! It is VERY physically demanding so if you are lazy and don't want to get moving, then this is not the game for you! This thing will kick your behind and get you into shape! Speaking of which, there is actually a man who did a six week experiment playing the Wii sports game to see if he would physically get more fit..guess what? He lost 9 lbs!! He got ALOT more fit loosing inches on his waist etc etc. I plan to incorporate playing the Sports game at least 4 times a week to get more fit too! There is even a fitness age test which after a few rounds of some of the different sports games like tennis, bowling, boxing etc, you are then assessed a fitness ""age"". The best to get is 20 years old but I scored 68! lol! Alot of people I read scored 68 as well, higher or in the 50 age range and these people were alot younger! It takes into consideration your balance, speed, reaction time etc. Usually if you play every day or on a regular basis, your fitness age will improve. I know I want to definately to move my fitness age to alot younger to match my age group. It's amazing to play tennis while you are moving the Wii-mote like an actual tennis racket or play bowling while swinging your arm like you are holding a real bowling ball. It's just the coolest thing. The baseball game is a blast, I Love the crack of the ball when I wack the hell out of the ball sending it soaring. A very fun game!

PLEASE do NOT let the Online capabilities pass you by! You thought the Wii was fun by itself, wait til you get connected to the Wii's internet either via Wifi (wireless) or wired (ethernet/lan) with a dsl modem or wired router, you have this whole new other world available to you. You can actually DOWNLOAD CLASSIC games to your Wii!! via the ""Virtual Console"" (VC) so you can play classic NES games, Super Nintendo games, Sega Master System games and Turbogrfx. You need to buy Wii ""points"" in order to pay for the games because they are not free. You can get points by using your credit/debit card or if you don't have them, you can buy the Nintendo Points cards at your local gaming store, walmart, target etc and redeem them. I haven't bought the games I want yet because most of them use the classic Wii controller which is sold separately but when I get it, I plan to d/l the Zelda N64 game. Imagine that..you can have Wii games, Gamecube backwards capability AND you can DOWNLOAD Classic games!  There is a weather channel, a new voting channel in which you get to cast your vote on various questions, there is even an international vote question. There is a internet channel where you use a web browser to surf the net and you can even register ""friends"" so you can email them etc.

I'm running out of space here, but I HIGHLY recommend the Wii to all age groups, it is NOT just for kids, I only know one child with the Wii and the rest are all adults with no kids! The Wii is extremely fun, has great potential and with the online features, it's just a great experience for anyone. You may have been putting off getting the Wii or thought the Wii remote control was lame looking, but you don't know what you are missing. BUY IT and see for yourself. If you buy it now and register, Nintendo will increase your warranty to 90 days making your warranty 15 months instead of just 12 months!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_201?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=201&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I can say without question that the one that brings the most joy and is the most fun for the family is the Wii.  Nintendo's decision not to go toe-to-toe with Microsoft and Sony was a wise one.  By focusing on gameplay and really nailing the wireless and motion-sensitive controllers, they have created gameplay that is addictive, incredibly fun, physical and novel.  Sure it doesn't output in HD, but with the component cable (which unfortunately costs extra) the output is 480p and is clear and DVD quality.  It is certainly enough for the majority of players.

Many members of my extended family do not play video games at all but they couldn't stop playing Wii Sports, which is wisely bundled with the console so you can play the console right away without purchasing another title.  Each person in my family has their favorite of the five games on Wii Sports, but it showcases the motion-sensitive controller and gets you used to this new type of gameplay.  My mother-in-law, who I have never seen play any video game ever, loved Wii Bowling.  My two cousins (under 11) challenged each other in boxing and stopped fifteen minutes later only because they were sweating and so exhausted that they couldn't raise their arms.  How many times does that happen while playing video games?

A huge selling point for me was the Virtual Console, the online store where you can download classic games from the original Nintendo Entertainment System, the Super NES, Sega Genesis, TurboGrafx 16 and the N64.  What a great nostalgic trip.  Once I got the wireless connection set up, I bought some Wii points and downloaded the original NES Legend of Zelda, and this past week downloaded Super Mario Bros.  Playing these games takes me back to when we got our first NES in 1986, and it has been a blast.

For $250, it is without question the best value, the most fun and the best gameplay right now for any age and level of experience.  I cannot recommend it more, and I have not been this excited for a game console in 20 years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_180?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=180&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's extremely fun. Nintendo fans will have a blast. Metroid, The Legend of Zelda, Pokemon, Super Mario Bros. There's also the virtual console. For a few hundred points, you can buy older video games,even Sega ones.

This is a great buy,the best console of this generation. It has what the others lack. Fun. Pure fun. It has tons of it.

This is my favorite console to date, and most defiantly one of the best consoles.

It has a better array of games then the other consoles, and is more fun, in my opinion.

I highly recommend this, even if you own a PS2, PS3 or 360.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_198?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=198&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Brocius","The best ever...and will only get better.","June 27, 2007","I am a hardcore gamer, have been since i was 6 in the '80s, and wanted to throw in my two cents on Nintendo's new contenda.  i know there are a lot of Sony fanboys out there who want to talk about the PS3 (i do eventually want one, too) but the fact of the matter is that Sony basically gave me, along with many other gamers, the finger with the release of the PS3, believing their own legend would make them a surefire hit.  Well, here's the little engine that could.  Nintendo has proved(sales figures continue to surpass all expectations) that people are happier with innovation than just eye candy.  Do i appreciate that Sony has beautiful graphics?  Absolutely.  However, when playing the Wii i am so involved with the on-screen action graphics hardly become the core issue anymore.  Playing ALL my GC games in 480p is great, the virtual console is fairly priced, insanely fun, and well set up(except for not saving CC information for later purchases), and the game selection, which admittedly suffered from mini-game syndrome at first, has seen an increasingly diverse sections of games, most of which are far more reasonably priced than competitor's.  For all the 'kiddie console' naysayers out there, we have Manhunt 2, Madden 2008(including telestration!), Scarface, Red Steel, The Godfather, and more besides, all including Wii exclusive controls that actually enhance gameplay greatly.  Honestly, nothing gets me and my other Adult friends together like the Wii has and Wario Ware, it must be said is a great drinking game!  I have owned this puppy since February have 8 games, not including Wii Sports, and love playing all of them still.  Plus it's really nice that it gets me and the wife closer together even though it hurts to get spanked in Rayman!  Keep in mind, the Wii has only been out a short while and with the amount of consoles being sold, will only continue to get more good exclusives and provide support to 'hardcore' gamers like myself.

But it's not. I'm a dad with a 10 year old son. The best game we've played is Wii Sports which comes with the console. That's pretty sad. The controllers should lead to some creative games, but most of the games have been pretty awful. Mario Olympics is pretty good. Lego Batman was pretty good- and used the controls well. Tiger Woods golf is pretty much unplayable due to bad controls. Many other games are really poorly done, like all of the Carnival Games, Mini-Golf, etc. Wii Sports is fun for get togethers, and creating Wii characters is pretty fun. Other than that, just about any other gaming system is 99% better.

The Wii can be played by anyone. The entire family, dorm, or office will be able to grab a remote and start playing.

It has many new features on it like wireless remotes, wi-fi online play, stores, channels, miis, motion remotes, exercise games, and weather channel. It has a great store that u can go to to buy old classic games with points and play them on the wii. There r many channles to use and buy too like weather, photo, mii that u get to make ur own people, news, and many, many more that u can buy. Its graphics r not as good as the ps3, and xbox 360 but it has great graphics for nintindo. The sound is awsome and very clear. It is very fun to play multiplayer on it. U can either store memory on the wii itself or use memory cards. Which it holds more than enough space. U can also play the GC games on it and hook up GC remotes to play GC games or use them on multiplayer games. The only thing i do not like about it is that it does not play any movies or music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_188?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=188&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Lack of availability and lack of money have held me back thus far, but fortunately I finally have one. A lot of people have said stuff like ""it's good for kids but not if you're a 'real' gamer"". Well I say that such talk is nonsense. I've been playing video games for 20 years, and I've owned a vast array of systems (NES, Super NES, Game Boy, Virtual Boy, Nintendo 64, Playstation, Game Boy Advance, Dreamcast, Playstation 2, GameCube, Xbox, DS, Wii) and as you can probably tell from this list, I started out as a Nintendo fanboy, but it's been many years since I owned exclusively Nintendo systems. But the Wii has convinced me that it's time to return to the fold. For one, the other two systems (Xbox 360 and Playstation 3) are way too expensive. Sure, there's a $300 version of the 360, but it's basically worthless. You still need to buy a $40 memory card to play any games, plus it only comes with a wired controller. I've been using the Wavebird for too long to want to give up wireless freedom.

The second problem with the other two systems is that they really don't do anything new. They're basically just the same thing as the last generation with better graphics. Nobody claims that the Playstation 3 has any decent games yet, so let's look at the 360's lineup. The only thing that really impresses me is Gears of War, and it only impresses me cause it's freakin' beautiful. In terms of gameplay, it really doesn't do anything that wasn't done during the last generation. And that's where the Wii comes in.

I'm too old and too jaded to care that much about bigger and better graphics anymore. I want something that lets me play games in a whole new way, and the Wii allows me to do exactly that. I believe that the Wii-mote will utterly change the way video games are made, and I think that it's capable of things that people haven't even conceived of yet. I'm very happy that the Wii has been as popular as it is, because that means that third-party developers are going to have to develop games for it, and those games are going to have to make use of the Wii-mote to be good.

As for graphics, yeah the Wii can't output in high definition, but it is capable of more than people give it credit for. Have you seen screenshots of Metroid Prime 3 or Super Mario Galaxy? Those are some awfully beautiful games. The Wii is twice as powerful as the Gamecube, which means that the graphics should be at least twice as good. I'm guessing they will get even better as developers come up with new tricks for using the hardware.

The last thing I want to mention is internet. Unfortunately, due to my computer sucking, I have not been able to get online with my Wii yet, but when the wireless router I ordered comes to my house, the process should be completely painless, if the Wii Operations Manual is any indication. I'm very excited for Virtual Console. As a life-long Nintendo fan, I'm very excited to download classic Nintendo games and have them right on my Wii's internal memory. Frankly, I feel that if you compare the Wii's online service to that of the 360 or the PS3, the Wii wins hands down. Sure, you can make the argument that Xbox Live has the Wii beat in terms of content (although that's not true if you have a craving for old Mario and Zelda games), but $50 a year? And no built-in wireless access? You've got to be kidding me. And as for the PS3, I've heard of no compelling reason so far to get online with it. If you ask me, it really isn't that surprising that PS3 isn't selling very well.

So to sum up, if all you care about is graphics, then by all means waste your money on an overpriced rip-off like the PS3 or the Xbox 360. But if you care about games and about getting in on the ground floor of the revolution, then get a Wii. You definitely won't regret it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_207?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=207&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I used to play video games by my self, every now and then a friend would come over to play but that was rare. Since getting the Wii I have played on my own twice. The beautiful bride can't wait to play and we have Wii parties with friends. We load our profiles into the Wiimote and go to a friends house where everyone participates. It really is a gaming experience completely different than any other. I can now tell you that I will not be getting a Ps3 or 360 because I don't want to end up the loner on the couch.

Console is super easy to use, just piug it in and follow the on-screen instruction. You don't even have to read the manuals. Using the special controller is natural and takes only a few minutes to figure out.

Here are some important tips:

* The Wii Sports pack in allows you to play multiple players off a single remote on Golf and Bowling. For Tennis and Baseball you will need at least two Wii remotes to play multiplayer. Boxing is the only Wii Sports game that requires the add-on numchuck controller so if you can't find an extra numchuck don't let it ruin your day.

* The Wii classic controller is a waste of money. The classic controller seves only one purpose, to work with the virtual console. The virtual console is part of the Wii on-line experiencing where you can pay to purchase classic games like Mario 64, Donkey Kong, Sonic, Bonk, etc... You can not use the classic controller with Gamecube games, however you can use a Gamecube controller in place of the classic controller, so instead of paying all that money for a classic Wii controller, just buy a few Gamecube controllers!

* The Wii store is not very developed yet. The Opera web browser is not available yet (it's early Dec) and there are only a couple dozen classic gamnes to pick from at this point to use ""Wii Points"" to buy.

TIPS AND BUYING

TARGET, BEST BUY, TOYS R US and CIRCUIT CITY. These retailers accepted Nintendo's charter and sticking to the plan, they are holding Wii systems when they arrive and then making them available to customers at an ""available upon request"" available date. Walmart has signs posted in their bigger stores advertising an available date for their next shipment.

All retailers are also helping out their staff, making units available to employees. So if you want one, find out when new stock is arriving and be willing to wait in line. If you can't use EBay and pay out a few extra hundred for someone else's time waiting in line. If that's a problem then accept that you won't get one. Retailers aren't putting them out when stock arrives, so you can't just mozzy into a TARGET after work and expect to maybe find one, by holding the stock back retailers and preventing this from happening.

* The controllers are also hard to find, but retailers are putting them out when they arrive. Often time systems arrive with the controllers, I've  noticed a trend, where there are controllers on the shelf often there are Wiis in the back being held for a specific self date. Don't try to haggle for one though, the best you can hope for is to get a date they will make them available for sale.

WILL HISTORY REPEAT (PS3 to go the way of the 7800 and Neo Geo?)

When Nintendo introduced the NES back in 1985 the video game industry was a bit like today. Atari was suffering because they had gotten into a rut of producing the same type of games over and over again (sound familiar Playstation fans?), in their quest to build a better game console Atari engineered the 2600's replacement, the 7800. It would have awesome graphics, it would target the high end of the market and it would cost a lot. But the 7800 was almost dead on arrival, In the early 80's game market gone stale, Nintendo released the NES, with it's packed in laser light gun and optional robot bundle, it was part gimmick, part innovation,  but unquestionably it was 100% fun.

Fast forward twenty years later. Nintendo's lost their dominance, now we have professional gamers and owning the latest console is like having the latest designer sports shoes, it's a cultural thing.

But just like the 80's, gamers are starting to wonder what's next. 3D graphics are now on their third (or fourth) generation, we're nearing photo realistic real-time quality. Gamers want something more than a high price tag and flashy graphics. If you would have pulled someone aside in 1984 and told them Atari is going to get their but kicked and their next system is going to flop you would be laughed at. Sony Playstation fans may do the same thing now, but what Nintendo has done with the Wii is amazing. They have turned the clock back and returned the fun to gaming, they've given us something new yet retro enough to be hip at the same time.

Forget the N64 and the Gamecube, let's move back to the dominate days of the SNES, Wii isn't embarssing in the slightest, it remains Nintendo cute, but is carefully designed to be modern. In an age when professional gamers stick to suped up PCs and the consoles are getting old, Nintendo has stepped and as made the console new again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_261?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=261&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My wife hates video games but loved Wii sports.  Just pick up and play.  No complicated tutorials.  No shapes on the controller to represent certain actions.  No weird combos.  Just swing a bat/racket/club, and your character does that action.  Simple.  Boxing rules by the way.  Fun in the Mike Tysons Punchout kinda way.  Alot of fun.

It accomplishes it's goal, it changes the way we think about playing ""video"" games.

So that being said, I'm not going to gush over the positives... I'm going to point out the few negatives I see with the system, but before doing so want to remind people I voted the system at 5 stars.

pre wii prep - If you have your TV in a room cluttered with things such as furnature... you might need to rearrange stuff either before every playing of certain Wii titles or permantly to get wii's full effect.

I noticed with Wii Golf... (especially if the censor is above the TV), the game struggles to pick up on my strength of swing. It also does this with kicking off in Madden. It should be noted I have a high TV (wall mounted very high), but certain games might be affected by where you put the censor, in certain TV set ups. Just something to note that might only apply to 10% reading this review.

Your ARM can tire with extended play of certain titles (boxing comes to mind, Madden, etc) (however I think as a parent potentially buying for Children this could be a plus).

and really that's about it... minimal. Basically I highly recommend the Wii, but I did want to point out a few things I noticed playing it over the course of today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_221?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=221&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have bought a few more games, and was actually first introduced to the Wii by my daughter's American Idol game.

Fun for everyone!","February 1, 2008","The Nintendo Wii brings whole bunches of friendly fun to the family at a cost that won't break the bank.  It really is the go-to console for just about anyone tight on cash and looking for some games to play.  It has just enough shooters to keep your trigger finger happy, with Metroid Prime 3: Corruption and Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles.  It has classics like Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess and, obviously, Super Mario Galaxy.  Not to mention Super Smash Bros. Brawl is coming soon.

The Wiimote + Nunchuck form an inseparable, intuitive pair.  Some games (Mario) seem to use the motion controls better than others (Metroid), although that doesn't mean Metroid uses the controls poorly, just not as well.  The controller is a solid accelerometer, and accurately detects when you're swinging it and in what direction and how fast.  One word though: the sensor bar's native adhesives are very weak.  Invest in better ones.

The Wii is a simplistic console.  Nintendo, as always, has been only a gaming company.  Unlike Sony, it doesn't make TVs or VCRs.  And unlike Microsoft it doesn't release software other than games.  But that means it can focus all of its attention on making a great console with great games for it; and the Wii shows that off beautifully.

Now for the bad news: the Wii's online play is very clunky.  I would say it's almost unbearably clunky.  The ridiculously long ""friend number"" that you need is a very ... interesting solution for online playing considering how Xbox LIVE or even Playstation Network does it.  Also, the best you'll ever get (I think) in terms of graphics is somewhere around 400p (but please don't quote me on that).  For sure, however, is that you're never going to even approach 1080p.  Not even 750p.  If you're looking for bleeding-edge, eye-popping graphics, the Wii is not your console.

Prior to owning a Wii, I had owned both a Playstation 3 and an Xbox 360.  I can say that all 3 play very differently from each other, but if you are like me and have moments where you don't necessarily want intense single-player action on a PS3 or equally intense multi-player battles on LIVE, the Wii is there, ready for some irreverent fun.  It's the ultimate party console, great for when you've got friends over (just make sure you've purchased some spare controllers!).

Before I leave, I should mention the Nintendo Wii comes with Wii Sports.  Before you bash it as a stupid collection of pointless minigames, I should mention that they are in fact a lot of fun.  You can't ever actually ""win"", but it's still tons of fun, especially if you want to waste time.  Don't expect deep gameplay, but ... I think the best example to give is the game Tetris.  Nobody expects deep gameplay from Tetris, it's repetitive as all heck, it's simplistic, and you can't ever really ""win"" Tetris.  Yet it is also strangely addictive, just like Wii Sports.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_213?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=213&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Other people start talking amongst themselves, watch TV or a Movie in another room.

Or just plain can't play the Nex Gen games/systems available. To many buttons and functions that leave you confused and unable to participate.

Not so with the Nintendo Wii.

Easy gameplay, involves gameplay for 4 people. Young and Old Casual Gamer or Not..the Wii beckons back to why we play games. for FUN!!

Loria","Great new system...great new controls","May 3, 2007","As you have heard the interactive controls are the best thing about the new Wii, that and the fact that it is the cheapest platform out there.

Games like Sports (free with system) and Wii Play are worth owning the system for alone. The boxing training segments can be quite a workout!

The system is compatable with the old cube games (although you must use game cube memory cards for them rather than the Wii cards. Another bonus is the wireless internet options allowing for downloads of classic games and more add-ons appear from day-to-day. Future releases like the remake of Destroy All Monsters & talk of Star Wars combat games have me looking foward to spending more on Wii.

One negative: Like it's competition, the games for the Wii are overpriced, but blockbuster is already renting them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_208?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=208&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I grew up playing mario bros 1, 2, 3, super mario world, legend of zelda, contra, etc... and its great to be able to play them on the Wii- you can just download games off of the wii store channel and more titles are being added every day. It really brings back the nostalgia and its great being reunited with all the old characters of my past. The ability to play older console titles, as well as the whole onslaught of great wii titles really makes this the best console in my opinion over the ps3 and xbox360.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_199?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=199&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Can't Nintendo produce a game with something ""OTHER"" than the ridiculous Mario character or name in it?  There's just way too few decent products out there for the Wii if you're older and you instead end up playing goofy ""cartoony"" games all day long.

You can buy ""WiiWare"" games directly online and download them to the Wii if you have your Wii connected to the internet, but these games are just not that good and I can't find any that are actually worth the Wii Points you have to purchase to download these games.  Also, their Wii internet browser must be purchased for Wii points, which is frustrating since you are already paying for Internet access through your ISP.  Even after getting the Internet channel/browser, you'll find that the browser is a joke and many web pages don't display properly, and ""most"" content such as video, audio, etc. will NOT function inside their browser.

Thus, if you're considering buying the ""Wii Points card"" to download additional Wii channels or games, I highly recommend you buy just a single card of the lowest cost.  Don't spend a bunch of money buying a lot of points, only to find out there's really nothing there worth downloading.

The internal memory of the Wii is sadly limited.  You can add an SD card to ""copy"" stuff too, but the SD card really isn't used for anything functional and doesn't ""add to the internal memory"" for storing channels and games you purchase.  Thus, I have to wonder what benefit having an SD card ""really"" gives you?

The Wii remotes work fairly well, but often times you're left wondering ""what happened"" because it didn't do what you thought it would and some games just become an effort in frustration because you can't perform the required button combinations to perform a task.

You can create a ""Mii"" character to resemble yourself in the Wii, but ""many"" games ignore that and won't use the Mii character, so it's a bit self defeating to do this.

If it weren't for the fact that I have kids, I'd never have bought a Wii and instead would have bought an XBOX or Playstation if I really felt the need to have a gaming console.  They definately offer a wider variety of games and genres and aren't so hung up on the annoying ""cartoon"" games that is the primary lineup for the Wii.

Kids will have lots of fun with the Wii, but to get all the controls and accessories to let your family play together will cost you a ""LOT"" of money, so keep that in mind and most definately research the Wii games available and compare them with the other gaming consoles out there before you commit to a Wii, or you may find the gaming fun won't last long due to such a weak lineup of games for the Wii.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_216?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=216&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought 3 games today, after waiting on line for 4 hours, and my son plays with the Wii Sports the most.  In fact, he has beat all the adults in the house in bowling and has not stopped letting us all know.  A really great system for the money.

I won't give up on the Hi-Def systems.  I need my blood-n-gore, superb graphix and great titles that Wii cannot provide but the Wii has founds it place in my family's hearts.

I download and play the classics which is an awesome feature, Mario World, Super Mario,  and Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog more than I play the Wii games. I guess I have to be patient.

The Wii proves one more time my point. The ""Wii sport"" video game does not have amazing graphics, but the gameplay is fantastic. You can stand in front of the TV holding the controller like a baseball bat and and see it wiggling on the screen  like it was for real. The motion sensor is quite amazing in understanding your movements without requiring any particular position (other than being between 3 to 8 feet from the tv). The system is relatively cheap (as compared to  others ...) and it comes with a game.  Among the lauch games there is ""Zelda"" which is probably one of the best series in videogames. The control of Zelda is pretty cool as well.

In conclusion...buy it!(as soon as you manage to find in stores...I got lucky...)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_204?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=204&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Santa brought this for my 4-year old son for Christmas, and it really lives up to the hype. His favorites so far are Wii Sports (this game comes with the console), Mario Party 8, and creating Miis. I love the Zapper (sold separately for about $20 and includes a game), Tomb Raider, and Resident Evil. If you have a wireless network, it is incredibly simple to connect to the internet, which opens up even more possibilities (my son likes the create a Mii contests).

One note of caution though - should you need to open up the console to retrieve a toy that was jammed in by an almost 2-year old, you'll need a special screwdriver called a ""tri-wing."" Only a couple of bucks online, but with shipping, it can take a week or so to arrive.

Bullock","Next Generation Game System","January 7, 2007","I never considered myself a full-fledged gamer until this system came out. I work at Toys R Us so when they came in one day suddenly, i put on on hold and bought it after my shift off of impulse. I must say, it was well worth the money.

I havnt been able to turn it off since the day I got it. Although the graphics arnt up to 2007 standards the gameplay is awesome. The entire thing is all motion actiavated and the Wii sports is one of the best things about it. After a few rounds of baseball my shoulders began to ache.

Its a great game system also in the fact that it doesnt allow you to sit down and play games all day. You actually get up and do something. So now more being lazy I guess.

But overall, its an absolute awesome system and well worht the little bit of money that it costs. its good for everyone, even non-gamers as its easy to figure out with very few buttons on the remote to have to deal with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_197?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=197&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Franz","Strangely appealing, more fun than should be allowed, possibly hazardous to your (friend's) health","January 18, 2007","Although Nintendo is somewhat of a household name for someone of my age (>40), I never really thought of getting myself a console. If I play games, I always played (and still do) them on a (high-end) computer. All that changed when I first saw the wii demoed shortly before christmas 2006. What intrigued me was their truly innovative game controller design (yes, boys love toys), and the way they integrated into the games (I saw demos from the wii sports series).

So, on a whim, I decided on getting myself a wii, without really knowing what I got myself into. For even measure I threw in a second controller (I seldom play alone), and a title I seemed to recognize: Legends of Zelda. The box I purchased came with wii sports, and the second controller came with wii play.

Please note that I have no experience with regard to other consoles, and the following is purely my experience I derived from playing with wii.

First of all, the device is easy to set up. The console's design and manual make it clear that this is a mature product from a company that has a lot of experience creating consumer devices. You can't, for example, accidentally mix up plugs. The only thing that I did not like was the flimsy wire that connetcs the console to the sensor strip (which looks like an accident waiting to happen). Plug in power, plug in sensor strip (this was the most difficult, as I could not decide where to put it for best performance. As it turned out, I shouldn't have bothered. It works no matter where I place it), connect to TV, pair with controllers, and I was ready to go. Using the controllers is strange at first, and using them as pointing device has nowhere near the precision I have come to expect from a mouse. During set-up of the console I thought that this did not bode well for game play later on. Again, I should not have worried. Most games don't rely on the pointing abilities of the controller but on it's motion detection. A very nice feature of the controllers is the feedback (both aural and tactile) it gives at various moments (e.g. it slightly vibrates when your pointer is over a clickable button, or chimes when your console becomes active in two-player bowling).

I tried the Sports games first. Yes, I've heard the stories. And laughed at those poor saps. And yet, it only took me a few minutes to stare sheepishly at my controller dangling from the wrist strap. I let go while bowling. It is a testament to the game that it becomes so immersive so quckly that you forget what you are doing. Going on to baseball I barely managed to dodge my friends swing. It was forceful. And executed in blissful forgetfulness that I was but a few feet away. I knew then that even though potentially harmful, this was real fun.

The wii also comes with built-in WiFi, which was a surprise to me. It connected without any problems to an open access point, but required a little more work to connect to my secure wireless network. I have not yet tried to access the internet (save for two firmware updates that the wii performed flawlessly), but I'm delighted to see that it works.

Something I also like in this console is their fun and friendly (and sometimes slightly over-protective) way they approach gaming. I really like the 'toy shop' atmosphere surrounding the device, which appears to be a stark contrast to the overbearing, testosterone-suffused ""GAME THIS!"" attitude that other consoles seem to exude (perhaps one of the reasons I never looked at other consoles). I already have that, and more, in my workstation (which it well should. That beast's graphics card alone has triple the price tag of the wii). The wii, on the other hand, is petite, white, and, strangely enough, seems to actually *look* happy. It appears to emphasize fun, not performance.
Accordingly, the wii's graphics are nothing much to write home about. Somehow, though, I find it strangely appealing. Even though the graphics are simplistic, it is the way the games are presented, and the way I can get immersed through it's game controllers. I'm having more fun waving that little white stick about than I've had in a long time of precisely pointing my mouse.

All in all I am really delighted by this console. I won't play shooters on it (for that I have my computer), but the interactive sports and party games are so much fun (and a positive danger to anyone near you should you choose not to be careful) that I simply cannot resist them. I wholeheartly recommend this console to everyone. If possible, try to get a demo at your local store. Beware -- you might be hooked immediately.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_209?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=209&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Each motion is picked up great and it feels like you are getting as good a workout as if playing the real sports.  Additional games purchased for use with the WII are just as realistic.

The best part is you can have fun playing video games while moving your body at the same time.  Parents don't have to feel so bad about their kids playing the video games.  It also provides great entertainment for the spectators.  Watching someone ""pretend"" to hit a ball or punch someone in the face when there is not the real thing in front of them is very funny!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_216?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=216&reviewerType=all_reviews"

First of all, the gameplay is very good. Especially on Wii Sports, which is the first great game ever to come with a game system. This is because the fact that you actually have to get up and move as if your actually playing a sport, which makes it more realistic. Also, you might think that you`ll lose grip of the remote but they recently fixed that by simply adding a wrist strap to it.

Second, the Wii doesnt just play Wii discs, it also plays Gamecube discs (there goes your need for a Gamecube).

The Wii also has a feature called Virtual console, which lets you buy old games from the Wii shopping channel and play them on the Wii.

Finally, the Wii can also get Weather, News, and the web (but for that you have to download the Internet Channel off of the shopping channel, currently it`s free). All you need for that is wireless internet or a special adaptor for the Wii.

Overall, the Wii is a great system, and I highly reccomend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_229?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=229&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I ordered Zelda alongside it.

I won't re-echo the sentiments of so many other reviewers in as great detail. Yes, this machine is fun; yes, the motion sensor is revolutionary; yes, it's cheaper than the other next gen consoles...

...But is this really next-gen, or an updated Gamecube?

I'm not sure if there's going to be enough interest in producing games which harness the true motion-sensing power of the Wii - only time will tell whether this is the case. It's a question of production costs and market demand.

Once the hype has died down I wonder whether kids over the age of 8 will simply put this console down and forget about it - or whether it truly will be the invite-your-friends-over-to-wii phenomenon that everyone is going crazy for right now.

I hope I'm proved wrong...","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This system is so different.  They play by moving and also stand up the whole time.  Simple games like bowling and tennis are played by the whole family and friends.  I noticed that syncing movement, speed of movement with each game is not perfect, but with current technology it is good enough for the youngest and the oldest to compete in equal terms.  I'm surprised how much energy we spend playing the boxing game.  Everyone gets some physical excersise so I can feel good about this purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_233?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=233&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The games have been very fun, and using the Wii remotes is pretty second nature once you start playing. It definitely becomes more fun and amusing watching other players take their turns. The batteries last pretty well in the Wii remotes, though I definitely see us getting the rechargable set in the not-so-distant future. We planned on going to the nintendo long before the surge in popularity due to the kid-oriented nature of many of the games. We have younger children and don't need the darker tones of the PS games.

It plays the gamecube games very well. We've bought as many of those as Wii games, probably. You will need gamecube controllers and a gamecub memory card to make that work.

I haven't tried the virtual console games, though it looks simple to setup. You will probably want to get gamecube or the ""classic"" controller for some of them, as the Wii remote won't work for all of them (just not enough buttons in the right places.)

We have had one issue arise. Our Wii stopped pulling the discs inat one point, and we suspect perhaps the toddler decided to put a few DVDs in at once, so keep this out of very young children's hands. On the bright side, Nintendo was very good to work with about a replacement. The customer service department seemed very helpful and the whole process was very painless, except for having to do without the Wii while the new one got here.

Overall the Wii has been even more fun than I expected. Everyone that has played it has thoroughly enjoyed it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_211?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=211&reviewerType=all_reviews"

As soon as it was unwrapped we tried it out. It was made more fun by the participation of two of our adult children participating. I should say at the outset, I am 80 and my husband is 83. I needed to work on balance primarily. Wii helps you to build your profile, weight gain or loss, and whatever goals you want to work on. Today I progressed from beginner to intermediate level in balance. All of this comes in game format but it is a workout. There are categories of Yoga, Strength, Balance Games and Aerobics. You can spend as much or as little time as you want each day, week or do monthly checkups.

Our family, being quite competitive, had a blast bowling together. I can say with great pride, I beat my husband in the first two games. So much for a hook! We also played tennis and tried boxing.

Even though this is in game form I certainly get a work out and can also relax with Yoga.

Wii is terrific and I look forward to the new features.

And all the games that use the wii's gyroscope tech. suck. If you have a tv over 32"" forget this machine. I have a 1080P 46"" lcd and it looks pathetic. The wii only outputs 480p. Right now your best bet is gonna be a xbox 360. It outputs 1080p, streaming high def netflix, super online play with other people and tons and tons of great games. Luckily I was able to sell my wii on craigslist while they were still hard to find and I immediately went and got a 360. The wii is a novelty and nothing more.

Pavey","Perfect console for me....and probably you.","December 17, 2006","I have been a Nintendo fan since the original NES launched and have stuck with them through ups and downs (loosing the FF series hurt).  The Wii is the perfect living room console system.  The last few years my PC has been my primary gaming platform. The console has been there for select games from the Nintendo library like Zelda, Metroid, and Mario games.  Most of the play time on my GameCube was for playing MonkeyBall minigames, Mario Party, or some other multiplayer game that anyone can pick up and play.  Nintendo was king in that department with the Cube and they will be even better now.  My friends who don't play any games have fun with MonkeyBall and Mario Party.  They aren't just for kids.  Look how popular DDR, eye toy, and guitar hero are.  Moving around and getting into the game is fun for everyone.

5 Reasons to buy a Wii.

1.The Wii is at a good price point to make it reasonable for a secondary gaming system as well as a primary system for casual gamers.

2.The motion control system and combined with the IR targeting of the remote make this console even more accessible.  You don't have to throw the controller as hard as you can.  A simple flick or sublte movement is enough.  Although, I confess to some aggressive swinging now and then.  Many people say Madden 07 for the Wii is the best version yet because of the control (just needs online play. Maybe in 08).  The Wii could revolutionize every genre out there if the software devs are creative enough.

3.Nintendo will keep their great multiplayer lineup and probably expand on it.  The new Rayman game is one of the new titles.  Returning we have Monkeyball, Smash Brothers, and many more in the pipeline.

4.They continue to have the best exclusive lineup in the industry.  Zelda, Metroid, and all the Mario games are amazing series that will continue to get better with the new console.

5.The virtual console is great. They just released the original Ice Hockey.  Now, that is a classic game that is still fun.

So, if you are like me and find your console to be used for casual gaming with friends who may not play many games, or if you just like the exclusives that Nintendo has, this is the perfect console.  Perhaps you are bored with the existing state of console gaming where the focus has been so much on graphics that only 1 or 2 actually good and original games come out per year.  In all honesty, unless you absolutely despise video gaming, there is no reason to not have a Wii.  It truly is the perfect console that has something for everyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_192?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=192&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Return Window closed, before I ever opened it to see if it even worked. This is unfair consumer praactices !!!!! Secondly I did not realize it came with nothing except unit, thus, I had to purchase all items separately. This why its 6th January 2017 and I finally know I was sold something worthless. Today all the adapters came in, my son was excited to finally play the Wii he got for Christmas. But this Wii cannot read any discs or games. You would like to think as a consumer they are knowingly selling items that they check and that function, not the opposite scenario were they don't check and don't know or they do check and don't care. My point is don't ever buy from this company and maybe don't ever buy used electronics. Learn from my mistake.

Another awesome feature is the virtual console. I was a long-time emulator user and loved playing all of the old games on my PC, but it may not be legal to download the ROMS, and I couldn't play on my big plasma. The first download was Super Mario Bros., followed by The Legend of Zelda. Since then I've downloaded almost every title that's been released.

The people who are complaining are totally missing the point. In a nutshell: if you are looking for a system that is ""Bleed through your eyeballs"" hardcore, than the Wii is not for you. If you are looking for a system that is simple, fun, and entertaining, than you've come to the right place.

PROS:

-Tons of extra downloadable content including classics from consoles past.

-Some really great games. I suggest: The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess and Super Smash Bros. Brawl

-Detailed interface design. Lots of little touches that show that care and love went into the system.

-Compatible with all of your gamecube games/accessories.

-Fun for everyone, from your creepy Uncle Charlie to your emo nephew.

CONS:

-Library of games is comprised mostly of worthless mini-game collections and other mediocre software.

-As mentioned before, there isn't a whole lot for the hardcore gamer. The only example I can think of offhand is MadWorld but it contains enough blood, guts and language to make up for a lifetime of joy, puppies, and rainbows

-Motion control can become menial and tedious in lower-quality games.

-Graphics are lacking compared to other next-gen offerings.

Although it is a departure from the norm, the Wii manages to be is fun and worthwhile. I give it two thumbs up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_213?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=213&reviewerType=all_reviews"

#1 - Getting Connected - In order to get your Wii online you will need either a wireless network, a wired network with an online PC and a Nintendo WiFi dongle, or a Nintendo branded USB ethernet adapter.

  - A - Wireless network - no problems - you are all set.

  - B - Wired network - There is no ethernet port - only USB.  DO NOT think you can just run out and buy an off the shelf USB-Ethernet adapter b/c I tried and it doesn't work - which should have been obvious, but anyway they won't work b/c they don't have built in Nintendo drivers (remember this isn't a PC).  Nintendo will be releasing a Nintendo branded USB-Ethernet adapter in the next couple of months or so.  If you are like me and simply can't wait to get your mits on some old NES downloads then you can by the Nintendo WiFi dongle.  Originally created for use with the Nintendo DS, the dongle connects to a wired PC and ""piggybacks"" off of its internet connection which it shares wirelessly with surrounding Nintendo products - DSs and Wiis.  Easy to install once you download the latest drivers from Nintendo's website.

#2 - Ok - I'm connected - Let's download.

  Well the pitch is that for about $5-$10 you can download classic NES, Genesis, SNES, and N64 titles of the past.  Sounds awesome (albeit a little expensive), but the available titles are still pretty light with 'The Legend of Zelda', 'Super Mario 64', 'Sonic the Hedgehog', 'ToeJam & Earl', and 'Gunstar Heroes' being the most notable.

#3 - Online gameplay - Xbox Live it isn't.

  Apparently the capability of playing other people online exists in the Wii somehow, someday, but .... not today.  Nintendo's free online gaming network WiiConnect24 is supposed to connect the world of Wiis out there with multiplayer online gaming and traveling Miis (user profiles in lego form).  However, there currently are not any games available that use this network, not even Super Swing Golf (a.k.a Albatross 18 - a free PC game that exists entirely in the multiplayer online world) and no foreign Miis have yet to visit my Wii.  If you want to play others online it appears that Xbox Live is still far ahead of the competition on this front.

I won't labor over the core gameplay too much as anyone reading this probably gets the idea by now - less focus on graphics and more focus on innovative gameplay.

Wii-Mote - Innovative gameplay mechanic or short lived gimic?

I think the jury is still out on this one.  There are some areas where the motion control is awesome and makes gameplay exponentially more fun that the old button pushing in other consoles.  Wii Tennis, Super Swing Golf, Trauma Center, Rayman, and Excite Truck show how the motion control for sports games, driving games, and party games works beautifully and succeeds at thrilling non-gamers and gamers alike with fun, lively and engaging gameplay.  However, there are other areas where the motion control is rather awkward and is probably not the best mechanic.  Fighting games like Dragonball-Z and shooters like Call of Duty 3 show where having an analog stick and some buttons or a keyboard and mouse still feels more natural than swinging the Wii-Mote around.

Graphic-wise the Wii rates higher than current gen system, but far below true next gen systems like 360.  If the 360's graphics are a 10 and Xbox's are a 4, then the Wii would be about a 6.

Overall, the Wii serves as a great innovative party platform for gamers and non-gamers, young and old.  It is nigh impossible to not have a terrific time with the Wii.  It literally puts a smile on your face everytime you play it.  With that said, serious gamers who are only getting one ""next-gen"" console will likely be better served with an Xbox 360, as the Wii is somewhat of a novelty that won't provide an all encompassing game experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_221?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=221&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Harley","The true next generation of video games ...","November 20, 2006","PS3 and Wii are both viewed as next generation, but although the PS3 has better graphics and more processing power, there is no doubt that the Wii is truly the revolutionary of the two. I had extremely high expectations for the Wii after reading about it and it has exceeded my expectations in every way. I want to make it clear I am no Nintendo fanboy or even an avid gamer - the last system of any kind I purchused was the SNES and my daughter did get a PS2 a few years ago which I have probably played twice, but I've never even played a Gamecube. I can tell you though, in fun factor, this system is absolutely unbeleivable. Within an hour of hooking it up, my five year old and fifteen year old daughter were boxing on Wii sports, and what blew me away is I watched my five year old beat my fifteen year old for two hours straight. The fact that we could all pick up the system, figure out the controllers, and be having a blast in no time was amazing to me. No, the motion detection is not absolutely perfect, but you quickly learn and get around the nuances - they are no barrier to fun. The old school games available through the Virtual Console and the Gamecube compatibility are also awesome. Now I can go back and play some of the games I missed without investing in multiple system. For thise of you who have drifted away from home video games, I have some advice for you - its time to come back.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_207?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=207&reviewerType=all_reviews"

- Very interactive; players move around and use body movement during game play
- More kid friendly games

Basically game developers are to lazy to make a good game that effectively utilizes the motion control.  So the stick to the generic controllers of the PS3 and Xbox 360 and PS3.  Pretty much this is a bad time for video games because i think the Wii is the superior hardware. based on reviews The 360 and PS3 have a lot of Hardware issues and it's not good to spend all that money if its going to crash.  So basically the PS3 and 360 have all the best games because the developers don't feel like thinking of ways to use the motion controllers but they have a lot of hardware issues and the wii has pretty much no hardware issues and is almost perfect accept not a lot of really good games for it.  I do appreciate the few games that actually utilize the motion controls in an engaging way such as No More Heroes, Okami, Legend of Zelda, and Super Mario Galaxy but those are only 4 games.  so really a wii is a good buy because it doesn't have hardware issues so you can actually play the games even though there are really only four worth playing.  But with the 360 and ps3 you get all those games and then it crashes and 4 games is better than none at all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_248?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=248&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We bought some extra games to play, but so far, the ones that came with it (sports) are still our favorites. We don't find ourselves playing with it unless we have a party, and need to entertain the teens or younger adults with something.  Younger kids like it too, but the controls can be a little confusing for them when under age 5.  My 5-yr-old had no problem figuring out how to do the bowling, or boxing, but tennis still baffles us all somewhat.  Sometimes we swing, and it doesn't register as a swing at all, or it's ""late"" with the response.
  We don't own any other game systems. We chose this one to help us get up off our ""sitters"" now and then.  No problems with the system.

Sober","Need a break from the hardcore?","December 26, 2007","Got a Wii for Christmas yesterday! Gotta work today, so I'm counting the minutes until I can get home and play.

I have to say that this is definitely one of the most user-friendly systems I've ever owned. My parents, who still prefer to play on my old NES system, were able to pick up the controller and just play, without me having to explain much of anything. That alone is a testament to the designers at Nintendo, who, I firmly believe, are sheer geniuses.

So far, every title that I've tried has been loads of fun. Now, granted, I've only played a few titles and only for relatively short sessions. Plus, speaking for myself, there's the nostalgia aspect of finally getting to play some new Mario and Link stuff, since I haven't had a Nintendo system since the N64 (which was also awesome.)

All this is coming from a pretty die-hard Xbox 360 gamer. And, I'm NOT comparing the two systems; they're completely different in their approach and style, and, as we all know, variety is the spice of life. What I WILL say, though, is that the Wii is a breath of fresh air. After just finishing Mass Effect a few weeks ago, and before that, BioShock and Halo 3, the Wii is a wonderful change of pace.

Yes, I love hardcore gaming. I love playing seriously gorgeous, realistic-looking, challenging, well-written, epic games. But man, playing this is just a nice way to unwind after that 12-hour-long Halo 3 multiplayer session.

I think this system is a good pick for anyone who likes to have fun. Last time I checked, that was pretty much everybody on the planet. No, for those of us who are hardcore gamers, this will NOT replace your Xbox 360 or Playstation 3. But it sure makes a nice addition to your console collection.

Oh, by the way, DON'T give those money-hungry ebayers your hard-earned money! The only way we're ever going to get past this stupidity of consoles (or any popular electronics, for that matter) selling for two, three or four times more than retail is if we STOP SUPPORTING the pieces of trash who think they can make a quick buck off of us! Eventually, those greedy little no-talent knuckle-draggers will stop buying up all the consoles and we'll actually have them available in the retail stores, for suggested retail prices! The current suggested retail price for the Wii console is $249.99, NOT $441.99 (that's the cheapest for a new console on Amazon!) Oh, and if any of you price-gouging neanderthal sellers out there are reading this, please, do us all a favor and go walk in front of a bus. Now.

Now to find something else to do for that last hour of work...","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_206?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=206&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Borden","BEST YOUTH  REJUVENATOR OVER FIFTIES","July 2, 2008","The Wii console arrived via Fed Ex in just two days in new, perfect conditon.  Came with Sports package (I ordered the Wii Fit separately).  It came with all cables to hook into my new 42 inch plasma tv, and it is a bright, crisp picture.  I have been a real couch potato for too long, and this is so much fun, I have been playing it every day for hours, especially the team tennis.  You can play one person, as I do, against the games pre-existing characters, or purchase additional remotes and play as a family.  I ordered a nice spungy mat, so as not to wear out the carpet, and to protect my feet.

Also, between tennis sets, or golfing, etc., I watch the weather around the globe, and up-to-the-minute news updates, as it is Wi-Fi enabled, and connected to my router.

In one week's time my arms are noticeably regaining a more youthful shape.  My legs and tummy, too.  It has got me up and moving and playing/feeling like a kid again.  Even my mood has been lifted.  The best part is you can move at your own pace avoiding injuries, while having a boatload of fun...  I purchased another set today (at retail price) from Circuit City for a family with a kid.

But if you're the kind of person who thinks graphics are everything, don't bother to buy this product. You'll just be disapointed. The Wii does not have the best graphics, not as much as 360 and PS3, but it is the best game console I ever bought. For the first three days I had the Wii, I did not leave my living room. No food, drinks, or bathroom. Call me obsessed, but it's true. Another thing, the Wii does not have many single player only games. It is more of a family/party console.

Rhode","Something for everyone - really!","November 20, 2007","The Wii plays and feels great! I have been nothing but thrilled with my system and it's been great to play with different types of people.

For gamers, this system offers excellent games that allow you to play in an innovative way. What's better than actually aiming to shoot something?  Duck hunt anyone? This would be enough of a reason to get it, especially considering the price compared with the Playstation 3 and X-box 360. Zelda: Twilight Princess, Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, Super Paper Mario and Super Mario Galaxy (and more) rival the best games on any system. In addition to these new games you can get Super Nintendo classics for $5 a piece and Nintendo 64 classics for $10 on Virtual Console. Super Mario World, Super Mario 3, Donkey King Country, Mario 64, Zelda: Ocarina of Time, etc. Are you kidding me? These are some of the best games ever made! And you no longer have to break out your old system and spend 20 minutes blowing the dust out and tweaking the cartridges to get them to turn on. When you look at the other systems, their games always have a bunch of hype and then, with the exception of a handful, the games are disappointing. You read those reviews and they all have the same continuing theme: the graphics are great but the game isn't very innovative or it's so big that it gets redundant. The Wii keeps bringing out high quality games with variety. Also, more and more developers are concentrating on the Wii because of its popularity and the creative opportunities, so the games will keep on coming.

This system has really been marketed for non-gamers and for good reason. My Dad actually played tennis and had a good time. He's never gone near a video game in his life. My non-gamer friends also love coming over and playing. I must admit, although I've been an avid nintendo fan since the days of the original nintendo, these casual get togethers are by far my favorite type of gaming. The Wii offers a ton of games for getting groups together: Mario Party 8, Wii Sports, Mario and Sonic Olympic Games, Smarty Pants.

It should be noted for those who haven't owned a video game system before (who are good candidates for the Wii) that it only comes with one complete controller (remote and nunchuck) and the rest have to be purchased separately. At $40 per remote and $20 per nunchuck, it adds up. With any system, you have to buy extra controllers, but a complete Wii controller is slightly more expensive than controllers for other systems since it has the complete motion sensitivity. Unlike other systems, there is enough in the box to start playing right away for one person at a time. If you are planning on taking advantage of the virtual console games (and you should) they may require a $20 classic controller as well.

Another thing worth mentioning is that the motion-sensor bar simply consists of a couple of infra-red points (read: heat). It basically would work the same of you put two candles in the same location (which has been tested by people successfully). Therefore any other concentrated points of heat are going to interfere with the motion control including candles, and in the case of my apartment, the heat being on (the radiator is only a few feet from where I sit to play). This is something that has only recently became frustrating as it's gotten colder. I imagine that for many, this wouldn't be an issue, but something like a space heater will likely be a problem.

Overall, it's the best system (and best value) out there for anyone except perhaps for the gamers who just wants the same old games with better graphics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_182?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=182&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Having gone through the Xbox 360, Playstation 2, etc...it just seemed silly to get another system.

  So you can imagine my surprise when I tried this out and realized it was truly revolutionary, with movements very close to the actual ones used for such games as bowling, tennis and more. The controllers come with wrist straps for this very reason - some players have damaged televisions by swinging too hard and letting go of the controller. So please, take my advice and USE the wrist straps.

  We haven't tried a lot of the games yet but we found bowling to be extremely fun and the skill levels of the games varied widely,making it possible for a wide range of ages to play. It does take some motor skills to manage some of the games and I found darts to be a bit taxing, although I have hopes I'll improve with practice. Monkeyball was a major hit.

  As of this writing, this system is sold out everywhere. Our local video store, a major chain, carries accessories and games, but hasn't had a single system available for sale. We found that extra controllers were very useful so do consider getting some as well as looking at these items:Nintendo Wii Bundle #2 w/ Wii Sports & 3 Games

Metz","Living up to the Hype","November 29, 2006","By the time I was able to locate and purchase a Wii, I had read various reviews of the new console. Needless to say, the consumer reaction had my expectations set pretty high. I quickly found that the Remote and Wii combo fully lives up to everythig that I have read.

I bought the Wii at a retail location with Zelda: Twilight Princess. I opened the box and 4 easy steps later, was up and running. Even on my old 27 inch CRT with the factory supplied RCA cables, the Wii menu was crisp and impressive. My Wii remote instantly and accurately displayed a pointer that seemed a little sensitive at first, but quickly became easy to control with only slightly smaller, and slower movements. I created a Mii: a fun little extra with lots of customization available. In seven minutes or so I had created Miis for me and my girlfriend that were actually pretty decent caricatures of ourselves. Torturing myself, I left Zelda in the package and popped in the game that comes with the console, Wii Sports.

The Wii Sports games are very basic. Tennis requires no button pressing at all, and you don't move your Mii character to the ball, the computer does that for you. Despite the limitations, you can control the hardness and directionality of your shot by simply altering your stroke hardness and timing with the Remote. Baseball is also rather simple. It is more like a homerun derby mixed with one-on-one baseball you might play in the backyard with ghost runners and ghost fielders (based on your hit, the batter is declared out or is given a single, double, triple, or homerun, depending on how long it took for the ball to be fielded by the AI controlled fielders). Human players only control pitching and hitting, but the Wii Remote operates flawlessly. I was even able to place my hit like real baseball, hitting it down either line or up the middle. After a few innings I hit my first couple homeruns and moved on to the next game. Bowling is as simple as real-life bowling. You can line up your Mii and put as much or as little hook on the ball as you want by simply twisting the Remote in the corresponding direction. I bowled the best ten frames of my life on my very first round. Golf is a little more difficult. If you swing too hard, you will shank the ball pretty badly, and not in a predictable manner. It doesn't help matters that if a ball lands in the rough, your max shot power is reduced by half and there is no chance of reaching the green in two shots on a par 4. The Mii on-screen does not always match your back stroke accurately. Luckily, the on-screen backstroke doesn't seem to affect how well you hit the ball when you swing forward. Putting and chipping are all touch. If you have shot at least four or five rounds of golf in your life, you can just look at how far away the hole is on the TV and swing accordingly. You can read the greens just by looking at them and adjust your aim to correspond to the slope. The ball responds pretty true-to-life and it is very easy to find yourself overshooting the green or putting way past the hole. This is not a fault with the Wii, however, it is a reflection of the difficulty of the real game of golf. The final game on the Wii Sports disc is boxing. Not quite Fight Night, but still rather fun; Wii sports boxing will warm you up. You can float like a butterfly, though your feet don't control anything on the screen. Your gloves on screen mimic where your hands, equipped with the remote and nunchuck, are in real-life. You can bring your hands to your face and block and then dodge left and right. If you are trying to do a punch other than a jab, it requires a pretty specific motion of either the remote or the nunchuck (just uppercutting the air will not necessarily perform an uppercut on-screen; you have to exagerrate the motion quite a bit to see results), and don't expect to be able to execute lightning-fast combos, at least not until fight night or a new rocky game is released. Overall, the sports games are more teasers than anything else. They show the true potential of the wii remote and nunchuck, especially for sports game applications. I can't wait to see some of the old sports favorites adapted to the new control scheme. The potential is there and Wii Sports hilights this potential while offering replayable games that are still fun and intuitive. My girlfriend, who will only play zelda games, was up jumping around, boxing and nearly falling over returning tennis serves within ten minutes of setting up the console.

Zelda is beautiful so far, but I haven't really acquired enough items to make any firm determinations. I did, however immediately go out and buy Red Steel, which I have to say is great as well. It took a few levels to truly get the aim down and adjust to the sensitivity, even though I am still occasionally forgetting that the remote controls looking and letting the pointer wander off of the screen. The graphics are great and the control is fantastic after a little practice.

Considering the high price tag and extremely limited availability of the other next-generation consoles, I definitely prefer the Wii. Graphics will continue to get better and better until reaching a level of near reality, but what then? Nintendo has taken the first big step in radically changing the way that users interact with the digital world and I glady forfeit some minute details and crispness in the graphics for the brand new control scheme. So long controllers with 15 buttons and counterintuitive, ""press this button to do this,"" memorization-required control schemes and hello pick-it-up and play, get-off-the-couch controls of the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_227?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=227&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The child it was bought for had never played a video game before, but instantly and intuitively mastered the basics right away, especially with the optional (not included with a basic Wii purchase) sports accessories package.

The Wii graphics are first-rate and the wide selection of available games was also very positive.  Also, the games are such a high quality that they appeal to both kids and adults, so you won't be looking at your watch, wondering how long you have to endure playing one more game with your kid - you'll like the Wii as much as they do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_204?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=204&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I totally recommend this console for children, teenagers and adults as well. You can bring good memories back by downloading old school games from the Virtual Console Channel, you can also play online and enjoy the good titles that have come out for it. The motion sensation is good enough and its price is totally good. I really like its design....

I considered a PS3 becuase I love my PS2, but I realized that I love the games I played on the PS2.  This is why I chose the wii, with games like Mario Galaxy and Wii Fit how can you go wrong?  I definitley recommend this even if you do not have a family, I am taking it over to a friends house this weekend to play Rayman Raving Rabbids and we are sure to have a ball.
Definitely not for hard core gamers, stick with the XBOX 360 or the PS3, those game titles are designed for you, the wii's game titles are definitely geared towards casual/platform gamers. A fun time is to be had by all when playing the Wii, give it a shot, like I said its worth the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Peterson","Great System","October 25, 2009","When Nintendo announced that they were making a new Gaming Console, I freaked! I've always been a Nintendo FanBoy if I must say. When Nintendo released the WII, I felt that it would defintely remind me of the ""Nintendo 64"" and ""Nintendo GameCube"" however that was not the case.

As you can tell by my rating, I enjoyed the system, I just think Nintendo attempted to take the cheap way out and thought thay people wouldn't notice it. Fans allowed Nintendo to pass the GC off without a dvd player, but the Wii is missing several critical components, regardless of people having 5 to 6 DVD players around the house, which consist of Pc's, dvd players, Blu Ray, and etc, it's always better to give fans the most for the money.

Also the Controller gimmick got really tired, really quick. I sold my WII to gamestop and that was the end, I'll join back up with Nintendo next generation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_202?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=202&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The decision to purchase a Wii over any of the two main competitors came down to these simple criteria:

* Price: Wii's sticker price is almost half of the low end PlayStation 3 and about $100 less than an xbox 360.

* Innovation: In that tiny box, Nintendo managed to pack impressive hardware (but only what was strictly needed to give an amazing game-playing experience). With a mind-blowing accurate motion sensor, ATI graphics card, an ""off-the-shelf"" IBM processor and even a wireless network adapter this little fellow has exactly what it needs and nothing it doesn't (no BlueRay Disc, for instance).

* Fun, fun, fun: Look at it whatever way you choose. We, in the universal sense, buy and play video games to have fun--period. Nintendo with this Wii and all it offers brought back the fun factor to the forefront. It does not matter if your console has a military-grade processor or 60Gb of data storage or a graphics card that can render a gazillion polygons per second...it matters not a little, tiny bit if it's not fun! Nintendo managed, with a reasonable price, to get everyone excited about the video game EXPERIENCE.

Both MS and Sony missed the boat and missed it badly. Way too much emphasis put on performance not enough on what matters most, having lots of fun. I see it like two car makers trying to make the biggest, meanest, most powerful SUV and then these little guys who many gave as being out of the map come up with this affordable, sexy, enticing and stimulating ride. All you have to do is play with one Wii for a few minutes (even the included games that, to some, might seem silly) and you'll fall in love with this machine in no time. I'm SO glad Nintendo was able to capture all what people really wanted in this gadget.

If you do not have one, please, please, please wait for it. Nintendo has said it will accelerate production to meet world-wide demand. After playing with this console for a little while I can almost guarantee that you and you family/friends will have a blast with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_200?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=200&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I am 45 years old and not even slightly interested in gaming, but the options available for the Wii for exercise are terrific.

I purchased the Wii unit with Wii Sports, and have since purchased another exercise ""game"" and a dance ""game"" for Wii. I love to hike, walk, get out on the water on a kayak, swim, etc. but the weather, and my schedule, do not always cooperate. The Wii programs allow me to get in a good workout that also engages my mind. When it comes to exercise, I tend to like to do things outside because I have zero patience for repetition. I can't stand DVD's after I've watched it twice, and going to the gym bores me to tears. The nice thing about the Wii programs is that you can choose what you want to do and mix up your workout each time. Some days I concentrate on my legs, others upper body, etc. It is fully customizable.

Because much of the audio is repetitious, after I've learned the ""game"", I usually turn off the audio and put on my own music.

Many of my friends thing of game systems as the old ""sit on the couch and point a joystick at the TV"" version. The Wii is nothing like that - it is fully interactive and responds to your movement. You can purchase add on tools like the balance board, dance pad, etc. that add to the difficulty and challenge of the program.

I am not likely to ever purchase a traditional war or sports game for my Wii, unless I did it for friend's kids to play with when visiting. I consider the Wii a great investment for a reasonable price as an engaging, and fun, alternative to my traditional work out. I don't think it will ever replace hiking, swimming, etc. for me, but for the days when my schedule or the weather keep me from getting out, the Wii gives me the ability to get a fast, fun work out at home.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

My birthday was yesterday and was hoping to get a Wii, but was not holding my breath especially since my wife expressed no interest in getting it.  But I got it a day early and my family and I love it, even my wife.  As for those gamers who scream ""graphics"", I feel they are only part of the equation and a small part at that.

The Wii is true to it's development name ""revolution"".  I am looking forward to more games, the included Wii sports are a fantastic hint at what is to come for the Wii.  There is so much clever polish in the whole system, such as using other Mii characters in the games, and having a player's favorite color show up regularly in game elements.

My Kids took to the system right away and I have even got my wife playing Tennis.

The features beyond the games are show a lot of promise too.  The ""channels"" available so far - news and weather and the Web browser in beta are a nice feature, I hope there are more to come.

My only disapointment is that Wii does not Play DVDs and they did not build in an Ethernet port but instead sell it as a $25.00 US accessory.

Secondly, I have run my Wii through almost every function it has. I've connected to the internet and downloaded games and used the Weather Channel, I've plugged in my Memory Card and used the Photo Channel, I've even wasted time creating countless Mii's and you know something?

Nintendo has been making games for over thirty years now, and they have a legacy second to none.  As such, any product they produce must be of the highest quality, if only to live up to the hype.

The wii is a mixed bag, and only partially lives up to the positive press.

Construction wise the machine is fantastic.  I've dropped mine, knocked it over, kicked it, gotten it wet and it still works like the day I got it.  The controllers are of a similar build quality; I have abused them in a similar manner, even having a friend mistakenly throw one against the wall, and they are fine.

Beyond the construction, the Wii can be great.  Can being the optimal word.  The system definitely appeals, but to a different market then games of the last generation marketed to.  By this I mean that if you are a ""hardcore"" gamer, who revels in endless hours on the latest and greatest first person shooter (FPS), this isn't really for you.  Why do I say this?  Simple.  The games on the Wii aren't of this nature.

Most/all of the games are targeted at a much more casual group of gamers.  For Nintendo this is probably a great move, as this ""casual"" market is larger then the ""hardcore"" market, but for many of us diehard fans might consider this a bit of a let down, and if you are reading this you probably take your games seriously enough that you will want something more.  In the next few sections I'll break the Wii down a bit, so you understand exactly what you are getting if you buy it.

When you buy a Wii you get the wii itself, a Wiimote (wireless controller) and a copy of Wii Sports.  Technically there are two things that make the Wii different then the other consoles of the same generation.  First, and most importantly, it uses a non-traditional control mechanism called ""Wii Motion.""  This is a combination of infared sensors and accelerometers which allow you to ""interact"" with your games naturally.  An example is the Baseball game in Wii sports, which allows you to swing your bat by swinging the Wiimote in a swing-like motion, and causes your avatar on screen to swing his bat in the same manner.  This ""Wii Motion"" functionality is not used in every game, but it plays prominent in many; Wii specific games will doubtlessly involve some use of these mechanics, be it pointing at the screen as if you had a mouse, or shaking the Wiimote to spin Mario in a circle.  When not using such functionality the Wii controller can be used like a normal, albeit uncomfortable, controller by holding it sideways and using the traditional control pad grafted to one end.  Other games involve a secondary attachment to the Wiimote called the ""nunchuck"" which connects to the Wiimote by way of a small cord.  This also has some ""Wiimotion"" capabilities, but mostly is there for the extra buttons and a small thumb joystick.  I'd say that almost all the games I've played on the Wii, beyond the Wii Sports/Fit have involved this Nunchuck to a large extent, and if you are going to be playing a lot of games on your

Wii you will have to buy one (does not come with the Wii).

My commentary on the Wii Motion and control scheme is this.  It isn't great.  It's a gimick.  The controllers just don't allow fine enough control for most games, and they aren't really easy to use either.  Games involving Wii Motion features are mostly spent trying to figure out exactly what motion the Wii wants and then doing your best to repeat it.  This can be fun, but it isn't intuitive, and for most games it is just a pain in a neck.  Doubtlessly this is the reason many games on the Wii, including the latest Mario installation (Mario Galaxy), have almost no Wii Motion elements, and simply use the normal controller features of the Wiimote and nunchuck.  These ""normal"" features are fine.  The Wiimote-nunchuck combination is suprisingly comfortable in your hands, and control is excellent.  However, by the time you have bought both items you have basically paid $60 for one controller.  So, if you wanted the full 4 controllers you have paid: $200 for the full set.  This is compared to the $150 for 3 PS3 (or Xbox 360) controllers.  The Wii's controllers also lack a ""charge while you play"" feature.  This causes you to buy chargable batteries, or to buy lots of replacements, and the controllers do eat batteries.  Overall, I'd give the Wii's controls a mediocre rating at best.  I'd have much rather had a traditional wireless controller with good battery life, and a ""charge while you play"" feature.

Now, to give a holistic overview, we must address the Wii's software.  The Wii itself has great software.  The interface is intuitive and unobtrusive.  Updates happen very seemlessly and painlessly through the wifi, and configuration and setup is a breeze.  No one should ever complain about the Wii's interface, especially compared to the obnoxious layered menu system of the xbox 360, or the large tree of options presented by the ps3.  However, the system's interface isn't what usually interests users, so much as the games themselves.

The Wii's games...  Before I continue I want to make a small point about the Wii.  It is a hardware concern that I didn't mention above, but it really effects the games produced.  This concern is the fact that Wii is not much of a performance increase over the gamecube.  The result are graphics that are not as visually stunning and those found on the PS3 or Xbox 360.  Also of note is that the Wii does not provide true HD video, but merely some upscaled 480p.  These combined attributes are definitely a major factor in the sad truth about Wii games, which is that they are not cutting edge installments with the best graphics and the hottest gameplay.  Every game I've played for Wii has been one of a few

categories.  1) Gimicky use of the Wii Motion.  2) A Nintendo produced rehashing of one of their key franchises (Mario, Zelda).  3) A port from another console.

I'll expand on this categories with examples:
1) examples: Wii Sports, Wii Fit, Wii Sports Resort
  These consist of a bunch of mini games centered around use of the Wii Motion Capabilities.  Fun, but mostly just a gimicky display of a neat technology.  These are the most fun to play with others.  So I'd consider them a ""party"" game.
2) examples: Mario Galaxy, Mario Kart Wii, Zelda Twilight Princess
  Great games, worthly sucessors to the franchises, and the closest to targeting the ""hardcore"" market on the Wii.  Still, they are basically status quo for nintendo.  Don't expect anything magical with these.
3) Port
  Gamecube games updated and released, or virtual console games (emulated games from other systems --genesis, snes, nes, ect-- on the Wii)
  This category is great, and a saving grace, in my opinion.  I've spent probably half my time on the Wii playing virtual console games, but they are costly, ($5-$15 a pop)  and not original content.

These categories pretty much describe ALL games I've seen for the Wii.  I'd summerize by saying that the Wii has little ""original"" content, and  does not a vast library of games.  Games on it are fun, but they are gimicky party games to play with your friends.  It is a sad sad truth, but I'd say that the Wii is basically a gimped system, stuck with its core contigency of status quo items (Zelda, Mario, Metroid) and with little to no third party development going on.

I suggest the Wii for anyone who wants one of these few things: A bunch of Gimicky party games. More of Nintendo's staple fair, such as Mario. OR a never ending supply of old nintendo classics for download (costs money).

Do NOT buy the Wii if you want a modern gaming experience with all the bells and whistles.

I want to clarify before I end this review.  The Wii is a great system.  There is nothing better, in my mind, the bashing each other in a rousing game of Mario Kart or Smash Brothers.  The virtual console is also a great feature, and has created many nostalgia filled hours for me.  That said, be aware that in many ways it is technologically inferior to its siblings AND it isn't really as cheap as it claims to be, due to the cost of all the necessary accessories.

If you don't care about having the latest and greatest and want something you can sit down with for a few minutes here and there (and have a great time with) the Wii is the system for you.

Final Word: I own all three systems.  I would buy my Wii again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_209?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=209&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Wii is all about being IN THE GAME. If you're after eye candy then the Wii is not for you. The Wii runs at a low 420p so in the graphics department, they're way behind than PS3 and 360. But gameplay and interactivity, coupled with user-friendly interface, this system is a winner. No wonder people young and mostly old buy this system, waiting it out in the cold January morning just to get this machine.

The size of the console is pretty small. I'd say half the size of a cereal box in length and thickness. Installation is straightforward. Plug the cables in the back of the TV. The only step that's different is installing the sensor bar. The sensor is a black bar, about a foot in length. It's the device that senses the Wii's wireless controller, almost like a motion detector device. You place it ( I recommend) on top of your TV and then calibrate it with your controller. Once it detects the controller, the Wii is up and running.

The system comes with a game called Wii Sports. It casts several sports games e.g. boxing, tennis, baseball, etc. Tennis is what I play the most. You start ""hitting"" the ball and the controller is very responsive. Boxing is useful if you want to lose weight. Holding the nunchuk and the controller and throwing punches in the air can get pretty exhausting. But it's GREAT FUN! Golf is another game worth mentioning. It does feel like you're hitting the ball in a golf course. When Tiger Woods comes out for the Wii, I'll make sure I get it.

There are other games out there worth getting for the Wii. Zelda, which is by itself an instant hit. Then there's the hilarious Wario Smooth Moves where you have to perform action using your remote to solve a puzzle.

All in all, I have been playing with my Wii that my 360 and PS3. I've logged in more hours with my Wii than my 360 or PS3. If you want to get off that chair and play interactive games, get a Wii. You'll fall in love with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_178?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=178&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The first time I used one I realized the potential for collaborative and competitive games it offers. I was drawn to the fact that I could bowl with my grandson, for example, right in my living room.

Now that I have had my own for a few weeks and have used several programs on it, I am finding it useful as well as fun. It is easy to set up and use and offers options not available through DVDs or other types of activities. Nintendo designed it for all ages and its sales represent that they designed it properly for this wider audience. I suspect hard-core gamers choose other platforms and of course I don't care. However, many serious games are available for the wii.

To date, I have used wii Sports, Guitar Hero III, and My Fitness Coach on my own wii. I downloaded a home design game and an elderly donkey kong math game, which my nine-year-old grandson has played extensively. I get better each time I use one of these games. I think that's the essence of gaming, of course. I may suck at the start but I can improve, and that makes it fun and useful not just for me but for all of us who play together.

I have also played in a band at my daughter's house, courtesy of Guitar Hero World Tour, and believe me, that's where it's at for groups. I am gradually persuading my elderly friends to come over to learn how to do this Guitar Hero thing and then I will work them into my own band (Geezers, of course) and we can play together. Although I am by nature a loner, I can see this as a way to have fun with a group without needing to be an excellent conversationalist or mixer.

My experience with My Fitness Coach has been mixed but the point of this review is the platform rather than the individual games. I see the potential for a really excellent fitness program (not yet designed, unfortunately) suitable for all ages and all conditions, including disabilities. I'll note in passing that I prefer the inexpensive Fitness Coach to wii Fit, which my daughter had and I tried.

I also enjoy the limited opportunities to connect with others online. I have sent messages and pictures to my daughters from my wii to theirs. My grandson has played guitar with others online. I suspect this aspect of the game will expand and I hope it does.

Overall, I find it versatile and fun and really just at the beginning of its potential.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_177?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=177&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It may have been the case in 2006, but in Christmas 2008, its more expensive than higher quality consoles like the Xbox 360 [...] which bundles with multiple games.  In fact, with an extra controller purchase, the Wii currently will run you well over [...].

That being said.  There's a place fore Wii.  My 60+ yr old parents wanted a Wii to enjoy the social aspect of Wii Sports.  They may eventually buy another title to go with it, but it's pretty much a 2008 ""pong"" device for them.  They really love it and its fun to have a platform to play games and share some friendly competition.

The Wii console appears to be more about the additions that you can buy for it.  I'd compare it to an iPod.  Everyone wants one and has to buy all of the toys that goes with it, but in the long run an IPod isn't really better than other MP3 players and the Wii is the least capable gaming console that you can buy for the money.  It's direct competitors in the market Sony PS3 and Microsoft Xbox 360 have HD graphics, digital sound, immense game libraries as well as other features.  Both Sony and Microsoft have extensive online play.  Sony includes one of the best blueray players for the price point, while Microsoft has the best online services.

So if you want a game that good for little kids or grandparents.  Get a Wii. They will love it.  If you want a gaming platform that has the best graphics, video, online interactions...  The Wii comes into last place amonst its competitors.

Its a nice console,  for me it would have sit beside my xbox 360 and would only be used for games like Wii Sports with company.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Or at least I thought I was.  When the ""Revolution"" was announced, it was presented as a true innovation, in vein of the analog stick or d-pad, which would bring a new dimension of control to games.  That hype eventually fizzled to nothing, and now we are left with what we have today.

The much vaunted technology that was included in the original Wii controller is a step backwards.  It doesn't directly reflect the player's actions on-screen as was expected after Nintendo hyped the controller incessantly. Rather than making games deeper than they had ever been before, it simply replaces button presses as a means to initiate animations.  You might be wondering, ""if it replaces button presses, then why is it a step backwards, instead of simply being a non-evolution? (let alone revolution)""  Well, there's one big reason why, and I'll illustrate it with an example.

If you've played a video game (lets take boxing, for example)  on any console other than Wii, you'll probably understand that if you press buttons too quickly, a game might not keep up with you. If you press a button to punch once in a boxing game with a standard, motion sense-less controller,  then press the same button again instantaneously, before the first animation is complete, the on-screen character will only punch once.  With such a controller, this doesn't pose a problem, since your thumb will always lie just above the button.

When playing Wii Sports boxing, however, inconsistent motion detection quickly becomes aggravating.  It's not nearly as ""immersive"" as Nintendo claims.  If you motion to punch once, then motion to punch again too early, not only will your on-screen character only punch once, but you'll be putting yourself at a disadvantage, since you'll need to bring your arms back to punch again. Not only that, but it just feels jarring to see your character's motions not reflect your own, when you expect it to work swimmingly.  For this reason, you'll probably find yourself simply ""waggling"" to perform actions in games, since using broader, realistic motions sometimes doesn't work.  Plus, your motions might not even register at all, considering that Wii software only recognizes a field of  gestures.  But this issue is minor, compared to the dearth of quality games for the system.

As a long time Nintendo fan, I've grown increasingly disappointed with the Wii's library.  There are some absolute gems, like Super Mario Galaxy and Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, among the piles of rubbish, but unfortunately, they are far and few between.  Feeling dejected by the lack of games on Wii, I eventually purchased a 360, and realized that I had been waiting for games for no reason whatsoever.  There are plenty of games on other systems.  I could compare the libraries of the three home systems available now, but I'd be wasting my time, as if you care, you could find such info yourself. Wii is the only system I've ever owned that's had such a sparse selection of quality games, and the dry upcoming release schedule seems to indicate that this won't change any time soon.  I will keep my Wii, but only because I already own it and hope that there might be a few better games for it in the future, and I could use it to play old Nintendo games, not because its new games are doing me any good right now.

Even a bright spot on the horizon, the Wii Motion Plus, is bittersweet.  It will finally make the Wii controller's motion sensing more than just an inaccurate replacement for button presses, but, it won't be released until Spring 2009, around two and a half years after the Wii was first released, and it will cost you even more money, presumably.

So, I feel the Wii is to video games as fast food restaurants are to food. The Wii, like fast food, is massively popular. The Wii, also like fast food, is relatively inexpensive. And the Wii and fast food share the distinction of still being extremely disappointing to those who have experienced anything better, even if they are seemingly a godsend to everyone else.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_284?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=284&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Perrine","Excellent console for casual gamers.","March 23, 2010","First of all, the wii is definitely best for more casual gamers and younger kids who buy more less violent games.  So, if you fit that description than the wii is definitely for you.

  Pros
  Motion control.  It's fun to actually move and shake the wii remote instead of just pressing buttons definitely a plus. Note that you won't be able to replace wii with exercise, since most of the time you will be flicking your wrist to use the functions.
  Wii shop
  In the wii shop there are lots of games for past systems and new channels to add, there are games of all kinds and there pretty cheap, so there's bound to be something for everyone.
  Backwards compatible
  This part ticked me off about the playstation 3, it was not backwards compatible to ps2 games.  But the Wii is, so I can still play all my gamecube games on my wii.
  Cons
  Inferior graphics
  The graphics on the ps3 and xbox 360 are much better than wii graphics, which is definitely a weak point.
  Not enough hard-core games
  There are plenty of games for the casual gamer but not many games will appeal to hard core gamers.
  In conclusion I think the Wii is a very good system for casual gaming, so I give it my seal of approval.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

- Fun factor: A+

- Graphics (compared to PS3/X360): B

- Overall: A

Good points:

- My parents play it and will buy one for themselves.

- Wii Bowling and Wii Tennis are simply amazing. They are the Super Mario  Bros equivalent to the original NES that made it such a hit.

- You'll have more fun watching people play Wii Boxing than you playing yourself (part of the fun).

- Everything feels simple and easy to use.

- The controller rocks. I don't want to go back to old controllers. Make sure you get at least 3 extra controllers (one comes with WiiPlay) and one extra nunchuck.

- Insert your SD memory card from your camera and watch slideshows of photos and videos. Very nice.

- For those who bought a GameCube, the Wii has inputs for your old controllers (and memory cards) and plays all your old games (Mario Party anyone?).

- Creating a Mii is a lot of fun. A game unto itself.

- The most fun you'll have in a very long time. A great party tool.

Bad points:

- For games like Wii Golf, Wii Sports and Wii Play Pool, the control is not accurate enough. I do not yet know if this is a programming issue or a physical limitation of the controllers. However the good news is that for all other games this issue is non-existent.

- The graphics feel ""last-gen"". About the same as PlayStation 2 and original Xbox, or even worst sometimes. However Nintendo made a great job to create games that look awesome as the cartoonish look of Wii Sports doesn't need great graphics. I guess next year when programmers learn the inners of the Wii they'll come up with games that look better.

- Not much in the internet gaming space. This is needed soon (can you image playing bowling with your parents over the Internet?)

- Slow to launch the Internet Channel (Opera), so one just gives up and goes to use the PC instead.

- You need a USA credit card to buy Wii Points, which is a bummer for people living outside the US.

- Virtual Console (VC) games are too expensive. A price of $2 to $5 would be acceptable and would probably sell way more titles for Nintendo.

- We should be able to download a demo of the VC games before paying for them to see if we like them.

- When you download stuff, there is no progress bar, only Mario running around, so you don't get a sense of how long things will take to download.

- There is no way to download stuff in the background while you do other things.

- Often times, the Internet connection is lost for no apparent reason.

- You can change the language of the Wii interface, but the games do not. At least Nintendo's own games should detect the current language and show players an experience in that language. To Nintendo's credit however, neither Sony or Microsoft do this.

Bottom line:

With all its minor flaws, this is the most fun my family has had in a very long time. very highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_198?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=198&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I meant to review this 2 days ago but thats a different story. On Christmas morning I saw a bag that had a phone organizer, a CD case, and a Transformers Animated Leader Megatron and on the bottom I saw a Barnyard Wii game. Then my mom opens one up and I screamed ""You got us a Wii?"" My brother spent the morning putting it together.

I got a bunch of Wii games. I got Cars Mater-National, Merry Grifin's Crosswords, Transformers, and as I mentioned Barnyard. My brother got games too. The thing that all Wii's come with are: a remote, Wii Sports, and the Wii itself. I got a bunch of Wii acessories.

My favorite thing to do is Wii Sports and Cars Mater-National. I have a PS2, but I won't be using it much now that I have the Nintendo Wii.

This is not my first time owning a Nintendo console. I once owned a Gameboy Advance SP. The Wii and the DS have some sort of a connection.

I screamed with joy when I got a Wii. Luckily for me, it wasn't a prank where there was nothing in the box as I've seen in YouTube videos. One video shows a guy holding the box giving it to his ""son"", opens it and asks ""Where's my Wii?"" Then he blurts that he spent $200 on the box and inserts but no Wii (it was probably in the other room). The guy gets down on his knees and rains tears.

My aunt has a Wii and brings it to every family party held at my house or Grandma's house. For you Transformers fans, I hope they make a Transformer of a Wii remote. So what are you waiting for gaming fans go out now and get your Nintendo Wii.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_179?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=179&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Unique and ahead of the other 2 systems by far.  One thing nintendo has never left out is the whole family.

The Wii is by far the most enjoyable of them all! First of all, it gets people up and off the couch. Bowling and Tennis are very fun - great party games. Second, everybody wants to be play, little chidren to grandparents. Third, you can't get past the price. For $600, you can get a console, and 6-7 new Wii games OR download many, many older classic games from the virtual console. I love being able to play my favorite Kid Icarus on the Wii. Love that game, check it out sometime! Plus there's more coming out every week. I was able to buy a Wii at my local neighborhood store. They got 12 in one day, and they were gone the next day.

You've looked at the Xbox 360 and the PS3. Now, you are wondering how the least expensive next gen game console compares to its more expensive competition. Nintendo's Wii not only performs well, it exceeded all of my expectations as far as being a fun game machine.

The Wii is actually a lot smaller than I expected...much smaller than the PS3 or the Xbox 360, and I might add, a lot lighter too. How powerful can such a little game machine be? The answer to this question can be described by what happened on the first day of playing with the Wii...everyone in my household wanted to play with it. This is saying quite a bit as the other members in my family don't play games. I started out with the included game disk called Wii Sports and tried out the bowling game. After a few minutes of play, everyone wanted to try it. Next  came the tennis game, the golf game, and boxing game. To put it mildly, the Wii was a hit at my house.

Somehow, Nintendo has decided to not buckle under the pressure of trying to produce a new game machine on steroids that will cost you almost a month's house mortgage payment. What they have elected to do is to provide a game machine that has good graphics, fun game play, and a game console that will not just cater to hard core game people, but will offer everyone else, a game machine that is entertaining, fun to use, and non-threatening. And even if you happen to be a hard core gamer, the Wii should offer you excellent game play too.

The Wii is the surprise of the year. If you are looking for an affordable and fun game console that the whole family can enjoy, try out the Wii, because it really is for ""we.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_204?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=204&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Wii is now a household name thanks to its unique gameplay that assures interactivity like no other game console so far. Also, the popular titles like Zelda, Mario, Metroid Prime on Wii will please the fanboys. Saying this, I have been a gamer since my childhood playing Atari, NES, SNES, PS1, XBOX but playing on Wii makes the experience even more worthwhile. Also, once cant help praising the Virtual Console on Wii as it introduces to the current generation, some of the best hits of yesteryears (though I feel that some games are overpriced as per today's standard). The detractors of Wii love to reiterate the absence of strong 3rd party support. But with the EA games claiming 100% support for Wii and the growing interest in the industry, the heydays for Wii are yet to come.

It's a chance for Americans to change behavior. It is a much more active gaming experience in that you must actually move your body around a little to play. The controller functions as a virtual baseball bat, tennis racket, bowling ball, etc. You will at least get some exercise while enjoying sporting activity in the comfort of your own home. That is, no one will see your sorry behind as you try to recapture a modicum of human coordination and fitness. Go ahead, and swing away without fear of laughter and sit down when you need to :)

As a post-middle aged tubby, I think it's great! There are many other active games that could be programmed besides just traditional sports if it catches on.

Add to that the low price compared to the more hyped machines that have come out recently and you have quite a deal. As the natural economies of scale come in the fullness of time, this system can be in the price range of a lot of people and might provide a lot of healthy fun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_199?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=199&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Now, aren't the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 much more powerful systems? Yes, Microsoft and Sony's console offerings are about four to five times more powerful than the Wii. The main reason behind the Wii is that it is targeted towards a much broader audience. Honestly, no matter who you are, there is at least ONE game you will enjoy on this system. Now, if spending the now $200 is worth just playing ONE game, that is entirely your choice. Of course, you never know, that ONE game may turn into MANY games in the near future.

I am a hardcore gamer who loved the Gamecube and hated the Wii. The key term here is hated, past tense. Not until I began to find some games that actually appealed to me did I begin to enjoy the system. Currently, my favorite game on the system is MadWorld, and believe me, there is no other game out there like it, which becomes one incentive to buy the system, for me at least. Now, by the time this game came out I had already owned the system for nearly two years and rarely ever played it. My suggestion to all potential buyers is this, unless you hope to stimulate the economy by purchasing a Wii, do some research first. Check out some of the games on the system and see if they appeal to your tastes. If you can find around three-five games that look great, buy the system and you will have a blast. If you can find only ONE, maybe hold off until another one comes out.

In closing, the Wii has at least ONE game for everybody, no matter who you are. Games make or break a system, so if the games available or to be released soon make it a good purchase for you, go right on ahead. If you can't find enough value in the system, there is always Microsoft and Sony that could use some of your lovin'.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_205?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=205&reviewerType=all_reviews"

by w0kie, Jun 20 '07

It is June, 2007 and new Wii consoles are next to impossible to find either mailorder or locally. After a weeks worth of hard searching I finally located the one and only one in my town for sale at list price at a local Supercenter. My two elementary aged grandsons own a PS3 and an XBox360 respectively and both wanted a Wii.

First impression: Unboxed the Wii and hooked it to a 27"" Sony standard def. TV. The Wii image was crystal clear. I then turned the Wii over to my Xbox 360 owning eleven year old grandson. At first he couldn't get the remote to talk to the on screen menu but that problem was solved by relocating the light bar from the top of the TV to below the TV. This grandson had played a Wii at at friends house before and was ready, willing and able to test the box by first creating a family of Mii's. The Mii's are sort of like avatars. The Mii creation program is part of the Wii operating system. The player can make the Mii's wear different clothes, different hair styles, etc. This Mii creation is almost a game all to itself.

Then it was time for the real test of Wii console. The first game on the software disk that comes with the console is Tennis.

The Wii instructions, both on paper and on screen warn you VERY strongly to always have the remote control wrist strap around the player's wrist. Once my grandson started the tennis game I knew why. To hit the tennis ball the player like my grandson makes a wild arm movement with the remote. Everybody must stand back because the player needs living room space to swing their electronic tennis racket.

I'm very impressed that such a capable game machine can be sold for such a fair price. I know that I've only seem a small amount, so far, of what this very affordable game machine can do. Best of all my grandkids will bring me their love when they come to visit to play Wii games.

Pros:

Wii brings home the family love

Cons:

Its got a learning curve to it, but I think its a pleasant change to the gaming industry. The only thing negative I have to say about it is its graphics, which are maybe a little better than the original Xbox. Expected more from Nintendo, but I think the revolutionary playing style makes up for the lack of good graphics.

oh and the avatar system that MS has..AND the ability to install games to the hard drive..so MS is using the same idea as Nintendo and Sony..however they are doing it better because their online network (im sure you have heard of it..it's called Xbox LIVE)..granted you pay $50 a year and I'm willing to do that because of the content available..
downloaded TV episodes in HD,rented movies in HD,downloaded full games,game add-ons.

The 360 also when connected to your network,can stream content from your PC *I have a computer running Windows XP and Vista x64 on a separate hard drive and have never had any trouble streaming media through my home network*

I would have handed my money over to Nintedo,but when my laptop is more powerful than their flagship game console..I start to wonder ""is it worth it?""..

One reason why the Nintendo Wii is ""in demand""..they only make what? 10,000 units per year?..

After researching, we realized that all the FEATURED MERCHANTS have superior feedback ratings compared to the regular third party merchants.  This listing had those FEATURED MERCHANTS whereas some other Wii listings were lacking them.  What we saw was that the FEATURED MERCHANTS were all listed in them and had consistent pricing.  That made us more comfortable with our purchase (after reading their feedbacks).

We LOVE our Wii.  The order was completed and sent within two days.  Seemless ordering.  Wii Sports is great fun alone or with as a pair in competitive tennis.  We build up a good sweat from it playing each other.

We forgot to get an extra remote so we ran out to Target to get one (had to go to two of them since we couldn't find those either!) and we picked up Mario Party for guests to action play and Zelda for the DH.

It has games that appeals to ALL ages. Even to the serious gamers. There are over 20 Mature rated games for wii, and there are still more Mature rated games to come. Over 80 Teen rated games, with more Teen rated games to come. There are over 900 games for wii, there are less than ten titles that involve Mario. Whoever thinks the wii games are all just about Mario, know nothing about the wii and its games. The wii offers online gaming that allows you to play certain games against people around the world! The only downside to online gaming of the wii is the friend code thing.

  In the package will be (of course) the wii, a wii remote, nunchuk, wii sports game, and a bunch of setup and instruction manuals. The wii looks like it was made by the same designs as the DS Lite. They are both very apple inspired. Now about the channels. I love the mii channel! On the mii channel you can customize yourself so you can use your character in certain games. You can customize other people too! I even customized some of the people I go to school with! The Virtual Console is probably the best feature included with the wii. You can download old school games. Like from NESS, SNESS, sega genesis, neo games, super nintendo, and N64. I was so excited to be able to download the super Nintendo games I used to play when I was 3, and the N64 games I used to play when I was 6! In order to download the games you need wii points, you can purchase points off your wii using a credit card or visa OR you can buy a 2000pts card at any retail store. A wii classic controller will be needed. You'll find the virtual console on the wii shop channel. The News channel, you can see old and new news reports from all over the world. The weather channel, you can check the week's weather of where you live, and the weather of countries all over the world! Oh, and of course the photo channel. You can view photos and movies saved to your wii message board, digital camera, or cell phone. It requires an SD card though. I don't know much about it because I don't use this feature. You can serf the web on the wii, you have to purchase internet off the wii shop channel for 500 wii points. One more important thing is, in order to be able to on the New channel, weather channel, and wii shop channel, and of course to be able to do online gaming, you need a wireless connection to the internet. If you don't have wireless connection, you have to buy a LAN adapter. You can find one on this site, but I recommend you buy it from Nintendo.com, that's where I bought mine.

  Wii is the next generation console. The wii remote is what make the wii  the next generation console. When your playing a sports game like tennis, bowling, boxing, pool, and golf it seems like your actually playing in real life! There is even a sports pack that comes with, boxing gloves, tennis racket, golf club, and a bunch of other stuff to make the experience realistic. The wii wheel makes racing games like Mario Kart a lot of fun. Like the ps3 and PSP, you can use the DS Lite as a controller for wii on certain games. I think on the Pokemon games. The wii has excellent graphics. There little better than the game cube. They may not be as great as the graphics on the PS3 and 360, but there certainly pretty impressive. Graphics aren't everything, its game play that matters. What's the point of a game looking realistic if it sucks.

  If your a casual gamer I recommend Wii play, Mario Kart, Super Smash Bros Brawl, Mario Galaxy, Super Paper Mario, Sims 2 Castaway, Rayman raving rabbids 1 & 2, the legend of Zelda twighlight Princess, cooking mama, and many more. If your a hardcore gamer I recommend Rock Band, Guitar Hero, No more heroes, mortal kombat, resident evil, the god father, call of duty, and many more! As you know wii sports is a game that comes free with the wii. You get to play golf, baseball, bowling, tennis, and boxing. You play as your mii in wii sports and wii play.

  Thats my review on the Wii. I hope it helps. Oh, and please ignore the people who say wii is a baby console, those people know nothing about the wii and probably never played one. People don't camp out in front of the store for it for nothing. I recommend this product for anyone, but even though there are a lot of hardcore games for wii, if you plan on buying nothing but super hard core games, I recommend the PS3 or 360.

I thought of the ever so popular game stop, first, and attempted to buy a pre-owned system from them.  The quality of the components they buy back from customers is terrible!! It seems as if they just package things as they come.  The controllers were in bad shape and looked like a dog had chewed them. Needless to say I was not satisfied and returned the product.  I took a chance on this particular pre owned-system and just ""took their word for it"" so to speak as far as the condition it was in.  I could not have been more satisfied with the quality and condition of this product.  I would recommend buying a preowned wii from this seller to anybody.

By now I'm sure you know that from reading the other reviews, but it's worth reiterating how rawsome it really is. It's accessible and fun for everyone, especially those who've been turned off by regular video gaming in their pasts.

Yay for such features as a remote that 'falls asleep' when you've stopped playing and wakes up with the press of any button, allowing conservation of battery power when not playing. And for downloadable games from the past. And being able to check the weather and being able to track whose played and for how long. AND BEING ACTIVE! The best part about this system is the activity level required to play. Instead of sitting and playing (which is also an option), you stand and move and shoot and play guitar and dance on mats and sword fight and behead zombies and drive race cars. Watching is also fun, which makes this a good option for young families. Younger siblings will want to watch older ones.

This is really worth picking up if you are curios. You will find yourself  discovering and re-discovering it with every new game you buy, because the Wii remote allows for so many different applications and approaches.

There are games for this system for so many different kinds of players. Even if you are not a traditional 'gamer' and do not have other systems or been playing anything recently you will have fun with this system. Try it! Besides, it's the cheapest one out there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_186?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=186&reviewerType=all_reviews"

While Wii may not offer state of the art HD visuals, it more than makes up for that with its intuitive gameplay and artistic graphics. In Wii Sports, if you want to hit a baseball with a bat, you swing the Wiimote just as you'd  a real bat, etc... the list goes on. With casual games like Wii Fit, Wii Music, and Wii Sports, those who consider themselves casual will not be disappointed. Contrary to popular belief, between games like The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Super Smash Bros: Brawl, and Guitar Hero: World Tour, Metroid Prime 3, Call of Duty: World at War, Mario Galaxy and countless VC and WiiWare titles such as Mega Man 9, Wii isn't lacking in hardcore titles, either.
  So in short, if you'e been a fan of videogames all your life or are new to the scene, the Wii will NOT disapoint.

Will the Wii save your progress on these games, or is it just a play when you want then shut it off and have to start over every time type thing?  I know the Wii will save it's own games, but does it also save older games??  Thanks for any info anyone can give.

I just recently opened it up and this console is AMAZING!! I've got the XBox but this is just so fun, of course you can play sitting down but it's much funner to get ""involved"" in the physical games likes sports.

Wii Tennis is my favourite and it's become part of my workout routine where I play 10 games every afternoon, rotating between playing right handed and lefthanded, and believe me you'll begin to feel the burn, it's a great fun, entertaining, healthy and overall excellent investment.

The console is actually really small, it sits nicely on it's base and looks very sleek and beautiful.

I hear nintendo is planning on making rechargable wiimotes, that would help a lot instead of the batteries that it runs on right now.

Creating Mii is great too, and so many Miis can be made to look like clones of yourself, family members and friends, it's really great!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_195?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=195&reviewerType=all_reviews"

First, here are the strong points:
1. Obviously, it has a fancy controller that does lots of things other controllers can't.  It is comfortable and the nunchuck is a fine addition.
2. The menu interface is simple, clean, and expandable.
3. Comes with Wii Sports.
4. Your grandma will play this occasionally.

Here are some cons:
1. The controller is not accurate.  I don't know why more people don't comment on this, but you don't point at the thing you want on the screen, you point at a space above or below the thing you want, depending on the size of your TV and whether the light bar is above or below the TV.  So, it takes getting used to and is far from amazing.  If this was truly a ground-breaking console, why couldn't they figure out a way for the aim to be better?  The freaking gun on the NES was more accurate.
2. It includes Wii Sports, yes, but that's the only game that the vast majority of Wii owners will ever play.  Your grandma is not going to go out and buy Zelda or Mario Party.  I know several middle aged women who went out and got a Wii because of all the hype, played Wii Sports for a few hours, and haven't touched it in months.  There are lots of simple games on the system, but none of them are any GOOD.  Mindless ports, quickly constructed party games, and bland nonsense plague this system.  A real gamer might buy Zelda and perhaps 3 or 4 other games for the system, but that's being pretty forgiving.  I personally own Zelda and that's it because all the other games are so childish and rehashed.  Mario Galaxy was fun for about 20 minutes but has nowhere near the depth or intellectual value I enjoy on PC games or even PS2/3 games.
3. It is 2008.  How can a modern, popular console not support high definition gaming?  Whoever decided that was mentally retarded or something.  Even with the component cables(which are an extra, ridiculous fee) every single thing on this console looks like absolute crap on my 46"" 1080p LCD.  Sure, it's at least widescreen, but so are PS2 games.  Everything is blocky, ugly, and distracting.  My PC and PS3 have games that rival real life.  The Wii has games that rival a sack of cow crap.
4. It has no hard drive and the SSD card functionality is painfully limited.  No hard drive = No game demos worth downloading, no video downloading, no media storage of any kind, no media streaming of any kind, significantly limited space for game saves, and no custom content downloading, such as backgrounds or mods.
5. No DVD playback.  What, the extra 30 cents of manufacturing cost was too much?
6. No high definition disc playback or game capabilities.  Already this is a problem for the xbox360 and will surely be a problem for the Wii.  Well, maybe not actually since the thing can't even produce graphics that would require the space anyway.  The graphics on the Wii look like they could be stored on a 1.44mb floppy.

So, my conclusion is that the Wii would be a great console...4 years ago.  Or, it would be a great console now at half the current cost.  In no way, shape, or form is this thing worth 250 dollars.  I'll probably sell mine and buy it again when it's far cheaper, available in a bunch of lame colors, maybe has a hard drive, and has some worthwhile games available.  I give it 2 years to accomplish all of that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_248?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=248&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It makes you feel like your actually doing something with a game besides mashing buttons with your thumbs.  You can also get a bit of exercise with some of the games and it gets your butt off the couch.

  On the other hand, the Wii has terrible graphics when compared to the Xbox 360 or PS3.  The graphics are not ""next gen"" and are comparable to the Gamecube.  All that said, the Wii can be very fun though, like Wii sports for example...for a few hours...When I was playing it, I just kept thinking, ""I can't wait until they make these sports games with better graphics and better gameplay"".  You aren't given the option to field in the Wii baseball for example, which was disapointing.

With having and playing a Wii, another problem is going to be the height of which your TV is to your eyes.  When I stood up to play the Wii Sports, (which you really need to stand up to play to get the fun out of it) I was looking down a little at my TV, because my TV is not eye level when I stand up, which caused me to have my neck pretty much bent down the whole time I was playing, which was flat out annoying and uncomfortable.  I'll have to somehow prop up my TV, so it sits higher up.  What a pain...

As a gamer, just having the Wii, doesn't cut it.  Thats why I own a Xbox 360.  I want ""next gen"" graphics and a very good on-line play setup that the Wii lacks!  Wii has on-line play, but compared to Xbox's ""Live"", its extremely primitive.

3 Stars Overall, for being a very fun console and the wiimote motion sensing is very intuative and new for a game system, but the Wii is lacking ""next gen"" graphics, and does not have a very good on-line play setup like Xbox's ""Live"" or PS3's ""Home"".  In no way is the Wii worth $250.

Edit:  I've owned one for years now, it collects dust, end of story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_187?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=187&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I am 30 years old and thought that I grew out of the video game stage until I bought this Wii.  I owned the Playstation 2 for about 5 years and only 4 games for it because I thought it was boring to play.

With the Wii, I haven't had this much fun playing video games since I was a kid playing the original NES.  Nintendo did what they do better than any other video game company and that was they made their system fun.  Nintendo is the king at fun factor and gameplay.

The Wii comes with Wii Sports, which is a blast and easy to play.  My wife and I played bowling and tennis until Midnight last night and my wife usually doesn't play video games.  I also bought Zelda and this game is amazing with the controls.

The controller is the best I have ever used.  It is more comfortable than a regular controller as yours hands can be whereever you want to put them as they are not forced to be in the middle of your body.  You also don't have to get to crazy with the controls and almost all of the games you can play sitting down as you normally would.

The Wii also offers the chance to download old games for reasonable price.  You can download the original Super Mario Bros. or Zelda and a lot of other great games.

The internal Wifi internet connection works great with my Linksys wireless router too.

All in all, Nintendo hit this one out of the park and the PS3 and Xbox 360 should be worried.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_212?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=212&reviewerType=all_reviews"

NY","5 stars for the amateur gamer....3 for anyone who has ever owned another console","November 14, 2009","The Wii is a very exciting gaming system for the initial few times you play it.  After the novelty of the Wii remotes wear off, it loses its luster fast.  Its one saving grace is the virtual console which allows you to download all of your favorite games from old consoles.  That is what I spend most of my time doing on the Wii because you don't need to use the Wii motion remotes.  You need to buy the classic controller for the virtual console games, which resembles a super nintendo controller.  If you are looking for a game console for a party or to play with a group of friends, this is the system for you because anyone can play with such a small learning curve.  The Wii is also great for small kids who will enjoy the controls and lack of depth in the games.  The serious gamer will not enjoy the Wii.  The controls become more annoying than fun after a while and many of the games you'd want are available and better on other consoles.  I consider myself a mid level gamer, not hardcore addict but not a novice either.  The main resason I enjoy the Wii is the Virtual Console and the Mario games.  The main reasons I dislike the Wii are the lack of sophisticated games (at least half involve just swinging the Wii remote around in the air) and the graphics are worse than the other gaming systems out there.

One other way to break it down is this:  If you enjoy sports games, role playing games, or shooting games...do not get the Wii.  All of these games have versions that are better on the other consoles.  If your goal in a gaming system is to just have fun with a group of friends and don't care about game depth or detail, or just need some Mario in your life, the Wii is a good purchase.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_201?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=201&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Wii is a great game system but the games for it are not.  Even more than a year after it's release, most of the games available for Wii are cheap ports of games originally developed for PS2 or Xbox 360.  That's a real tragedy because the Wii is a very solid piece of hardware that has a lot of capabilities that are just not present, as of today, on the other platforms.  In particular, the Wii has 3-axis motion-sensitive wireless controllers, individual sound channels for every controller, Wi-Fi connectivity, and powerful multi-threaded processing capability.  These hardware capabilities are standard on every Wii and yet most of the current Wii games barely use them.  Some examples of what I'm talking about: with its amazing controllers, the Wii should have the best, by far, first-person shooter games on any platform, and yet, most of the FPS games on Wii, with the exception of Metroid Prime 3 Corruption and Medal of Honor Heroes 2, don't begin to use the Wii FPS capabilities.  The Wii should have the best multi-player games of any system because it is, by its very nature, an awesome multi-player system and yet most of the games for Wii are single-player.  Even games that are multi-player on other consoles, such as Call of Duty 3, are single-player on Wii.  With its built-in internet capabilities, the Wii should have a lot of online games but the reality is that only a very few Wii games, such as Medal of Honor Heroes 2 and Guitar Hero 3, have online play.  The bottom line a year after its release is that the few big game manufacturers have mostly trashed the Wii platform with their crappy Wii game implementations.  It's not surprising, then, the best Wii games, such as Super Mario Galaxy and Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess are from...Nintendo.

Original Review:
Nintendo has redefined video games with the Wii and created a new game experience that makes earlier consoles seem dated.  The Wii is this slim little box with an optical drive and a bunch of cable ports.  The controller is a little boxy thing called a wiimote.  There is a joystick kind of thing called a numchuk that can optionally plug into the wiimote for some games.  The first thing you do when you start playing the wii is create a character for yourself called a mii.  There are a lot of options for skin, hair, nose, height, etc that allow you to make your mii look like a faithful caricature of yourself.  Just creating a mii is fun.  When you've created a mii, you can save it on your controller to use for future games.  Once you have a mii, you start with a game.  wii comes with wii sports that includes tennis, golf, bowling, baseball, and boxing.  All of these games are fun but also give a taste of what future more sophisticated versions of these games will be able to do.  The wii controller is very intuitive to use and amazingly precise and sensitive.  (I wish there was one of these to replace the mouse on my pc.)  The wiimote is very easy to use and is just a lot of fun to play any of the games with. The only negative is that we wish we could buy a couple more of the wiimotes for multiplayer but no doubt these will be available soon.

The wii was simple to set up and turn on.  It comes with a built-in wireless card that easily connected to our secure wireless router after asking us to enter our encryption key.  Once online, it downloaded updates automatically and gave access to a lot of other wii stuff.  The wii has been in nearly nonstop use since it was taken out of the box.  The hardware seems very solid and sturdy, unlike our earlier Sony PS2 which suffered from 'disk read error' problems that led to its untimely demise.  I will never spend another dollar on Sony game stuff!

We have gotten three additional wii games so far including Zelda and they have all been very good.  The wii has created an entire new game platform that will last for many years and will forever divide games into 'before wii' and 'after wii.'","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_187?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=187&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Nintendo has finally come up with a gaming console that can be appreciated by both genders and all ages.  From middle schoolers to senior citizens, everyone can find something to love about Wii.

Although most people will want to buy accessories such as extra controllers and new games, the Wii is great to play right out of the box.  The basic console comes with Wii Sports game (a selection of sports -- tennis, baseball, golf, and bowling) with its various skill levels and challenges; a wireless hand controller with wrist strap; a nunchuk controller; batteries; a wireless receiver, and the necessary cables to hook it up.  Most gamers will want, at a minimum, an extra handset and possibly the charger with rechargeable batteries. Because Wii Sports has so much included within the single game disk, extra games, while great to add, won't be necessary at first.

For set-up, you'll need a space on top of your television for the slender, 9 1/2 inch long wireless bar that will pick up the movements and input from the remote controller.  You'll also need LOTS of room for arm swinging and back and forth movement (which will be unintentional, especially if you're used to playing the sports in real life.)  Don't underestimate the warnings!  Inevitably, someone playing Wii will cream a hand or knock the dog out or hit someone else in the nose.  Make sure the playing area is free of all obstacles and that everyone not playing knows to steer clear.  Even people who exercise regularly run the risk of tennis elbow and/or sore muscles.

An extra note about Wii Sports since the game is a large part of a gamer's introduction to the medium:  the really cool part of the interface is the way the Wii senses and translates movement.  You can hook a bowling bowl and put slice on a tennis ball, all with the specific movements you use. The game has a training area that goes beyond the mere tutorial and into actual methods of doing the sports.  You can also test for your ""Wii Fitness Age"" once a day.

Although the Wii is difficult to come by at this writing, I suspect it will become more available a month or two after the holidays.  Definitely pick one up. You won't regret it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_181?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=181&reviewerType=all_reviews"

You can choose to place the remote sensor bar on top of your TV or at the bottom, and they include adhesive squares and a stand for different situations -- like I said, very well planned.

Setup can't be easier, connect all the cables and turn it on. The system will walk you through a couple of setup options. The system has built-in wireless, and it can connect to the Internet if you have a wireless connection. If you have encryption enabled on your router, you'll need to setup the connection manually. Once connected, it downloaded 2 updates but it was ready to go within 30 minutes.

The remote controller is an interesting piece of technology, playing back sound, vibrating, and sensing your movements. It took only about 5 minutes to get adjusted to ""pointing"" to menu items on the screen, and I was amazed that you can also ""twist"" the direction of the pointer so that the hand points up, down, and all around -- I can't wait to see how this is used in games. The controller is well-designed and the wrist strap is comfortable and doesn't seem to fall off at all.  My 5-year old could handle it with little difficulty.  If anybody thinks the Wii is not technically advanced, a lot of the advanced technology is in the controller/remote -- keep that in mind.

Wii Sports is an interesting game package. Bowling is fun and very realistic. Gold is extremely enjoyable, and I don't even like golf. Even my 5 year old daughter could play the golf game.  Tennis is fun but somewhat challenging and requires a lot of practice. Baseball, as well, is fun -- but ""changing sides"" and pitching isn't all that fun. Boxing is fun and can be quite a workout.

In fact, I think the real beauty of this system is that you're not sitting down when playing games like those in Wii Sports.  Get up and move!  I can imagine a game where special controllers are strapped to your ankles, and you hold the remote and nunchuck in your hands...and you dance...while the character on-screen mimics your movement.  The possibilities are endless...!

Although I don't have a Gamecube, I love that it plays Gamecube games and supports all the hardware (memory and controllers) so that it's backwards compatible with the technology.  Nintendo can continue to write games for the Gamecube and those of us (like me) with only a Wii can still buy and play them.  Ingenious.

There's a ton of other features -- but in all, it appears to be a well-built little package...very well-thought-out, with endless possibilities.  It turns gaming on its head.  You won't be disappointed!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We have never expereinced any problems or malfunctions with it.

There is such a wide array of games available for it and you can download games right from the console as long as it is hoked up to the internet. You are gauranteed to find games that everyone will like.

There are alot of games available for exercise and movement in general, so the kids aren't just sitting there staring at the screen like a zombie.

We still have the original Wiimotes and nunchuk that came with it (as well as some extras we bought) and they are still going strong.

It was a great investment and has proven to be reliable, durable and fun for the whole family.

You can even go online right on your tv via the Wii, as long as you are connected to the internet. My youngest enjoyed this feature before she got her laptop.

I definitely recommend the Wii if you are looking for a more family focused console, a console for younger kids and/or to grow with them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

And then, 25 years after mastering Seaquest, I tried the Wii, and was hooked. It is so much fun, especially on a rainy day when you can't do anything outside. I still can't ever imagine playing XBOX or Playstation, but the idea of moving while playing a video game is so novel and just so much fun, its really perfect for people like me: almost lifelong non-gamers. Even my father-in-law, who poo-pooed the idea of us buying a gaming system had the biggest smile on his face when boxing.

I have to say that before we had it I thought it was going to be another of those so-so game consoles like all those that came before it. But I was wrong.  I'm not a big game console player but I LOVE the Wii.  It's easy to use, it's compact size doesn't take up a ton of space. The games it comes bundled with are AWESOME! Everything about it is just easy to use, even for someone who doesn't game much.  Plus, it's awesome that it connects to the internet and you can communicate with your friends, can access the weather and all sorts of other wonderful features.  It by far exceeds any other console that I've seen.  We own just about every other console that has been put on the market and I would trade them all for this one.  Highly, highly recommended.

I agree the graphics is not top of line if you use 1080P but the best part is it allows you have games with physical activity. That was the big reason, I got it for my Kid but later I realized that I am playing it more than my Kid. By default you get following games -
Tennis, Baseball, Golf, Bowling, Boxing
My favourite is tennis. You really get a feel you are playing tennis. The remote , which works as racket for Tennis is wonderful. It even simulates the sound and vibration , you get when ball touches racket.
Great game to play with guests. Have few beers and enjoy Bowling at comfort of home and free of cost. Until now I had not spent extra on games . When I will get bored with included games, I shall shop for more. It will be great if commenters put reviews about WII games as comment to the review. This will be helpful to WII community.
Also this game console wirelessly connects to internet and you can see whether, news or download games. Overall it is wonderful game console. I wish it was number 1 in graphics too. But let me make it clear, even with that shortcoming it is number 1 overall and that is why it is best selling (with a very wide margin compared to number 2) game ,despite supply shortages","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_182?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=182&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Fun for the whole family!","November 28, 2008","The Wii is a very user-friendly, versatile, and entertaining computer gaming system.  It really is much more than a game base -- there are channels so you can check the weather and the news, you can add an internet browser (for a small fee, which was disappointing at first until I realized how small the fee really was ... and since I can't post amounts in a review I'll just say it is about the same as a video rental and less than a movie ticket), and many more options are available.  It comes with a very fun set of games (bowling, boxing, tennis, etc.) that make use of the very versatile controllers that are included.  Additional games can be downloaded (for a fee) or purchased -- and now you can rent them (or buy them used) at most major video chains.

What I like most about the Wii is that it seems to be designed for family use.  This is not just for boys who like shooting aliens.  There are lots of activities that make it simple and fun for the whole family, from very young to very old.  You create little ""Miis"" that represent (and look like) you (or not, if you prefer), and they become your character in the games -- we spent a while just creating characters for each member of the family, letting each create their own but making suggestions to each other and laughing at the various options each chose.  It is a lot of fun.

With the internet compatibility -- especially if we hook it up to a USB keyboard -- this really becomes like a new household computer.  You can check email, browse, buy, anything you like.  (If you have a Gmail account you can even do word processing and spread sheets on their website -- so it really becomes just like a new computer.)

There were a few glitches -- we have a DSL internet connection and while we could hook up quickly when we tried to install the upgrade that the system recommended we found that it stalled about 4 times before finally completing the download and completing the upgrade.  Something similar happened when we tried to download the internet ""channel"" (browser).  Eventually we got everything working, though.

One more thing that bugs me a bit is that the Wii won't play DVDs.  Apparently it is able to do so, from a hardware standpoint, but they haven't installed the software for various reasons (and there is no way to get the software through Nintendo).  That is the only reason I might have preferred a Playstation -- which natively plays BluRay and DVDs.  I'd like it if I didn't have to switch between my DVD player and the Wii, and could just use the Wii box for both functions.  Still, this is a pretty fantastic device, that I'm sure will get a lot of use from my whole family for a very long time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_177?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=177&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Didn't feel the need to buy a brand new one since I already had the cords and everything, just needed a console. Ordered my used wii from the company EZCORP and received it when they said it would arrive. Unfortunately, my dog got a hold of it and chewed up the wires, luckily I didn't need them, but the console was saved in time. When I brought the package inside the console was filthy and nasty, and not from my dog, this was stuff a child would do. The cord you put around your wrist for the controller was absolutely disgusting and brown and smelled. The remote was sticky with brown stuff. I wiped everything down real good with some Lysol wipes but couldn't keep the wrist cord. It was filthy. I realize it is a used console and it's not going to be in perfect condition, but I at least expected to get something worth $60. The company should have taken 5 minutes of their time to disinfect/wipe down the used games they buy. We had our wii for a long time and it was in perfect condition and we have two kids who played it all the time. The console and everything works great, but it would have been nice to receive something clean and halfway decent.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Thanks to those who post on forums and customer discussion for tips that lead me to getting a Wii!  This is the first time I have got a system directly after launch.  I just couldn't wait for the Wii!  --Setup was a breeze and packaging was very efficient.  The controls are very nice and feel natural.  The Wiimote is very responsive and play is very real.  I have only had a few hours with Zelda and Wii Sports but I have no complaints with either one (I'll keep this to a Wii review).  Someone complained in another review about the controller being too loud and not being able to adjust the speaker.  There is an option to lower the volume.  I even had my wife playing the Wii (and she was kicking butt) and she was honestly sick of hearing me talk about the Wii so that is saying a lot.  After a while we were both laughing and having a great time.  I have been grinning ever since the moment they handed me my white box.  Don't pay a high price for an auction!  Wait it out and keep hunting.  I only looked for 2 days and finally got lucky.  Thank you Nintendo, I can't wait to see what can be done with this system.  Don't hesitate if you're thinking about the next system you want to purchase.  Go for the Wii!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_223?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=223&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought the wii initially because super smash bros. brawl was coming out. But after having the wii for over a year, I found other games to be more fun. I love wii sports. It is one of the only game I can get my parents to play (another is boom blox). For the record, the last game my dad played was super mario bros. for the nintendo and my mom has never played any games at all. To have my parents play games is a priceless gift that the wii has given me. We have something else to do in the living room besides watching TV.

The wii needs more good games. Don't get me wrong, the wii has some really good games. Wii sports, boom blox, super smash bros. brawl, Super mario galaxy. By the way, galaxy is a very, very good game. It is the my favorite game on the wii (and the best game in my opinion). However, the wii only has a few of these games. There are mostly bad games out there where the developer has just mixed in a bunch of minigames. These type of games probably outnumber the good games by 10:1 (I made that number up). These games are giving the wii a bad name. They make it seem like only 5 year old kids play the wii. This is contrary to what the wii is about. The way nintendo is advertising the wii, it seems the target audience is everybody, not just little kids. So, nintendo developers should lead by example and create some more mature games, not games like wii music.

Even though only a few good games exist for the wii so far, I think its getting better. Recently, Boom blox party, excite bot, punch-out, and tiger woods PGA tour 10 has just come out. They came out only a few months apart from each other. This is a huge improvement and shows that the developers are getting the hang out making use of the wii. An attachment, the wii motionplus (sold separately), makes the wiimote much more responsive and realistic. Where as before, little motions like nudging the golf ball into the hole 2 inches away could not be read by the wiimote, now it can. It can copy your exact motions. This is very big news!! In games like wii sports, after a certain skill level the pros become the same because there is not much more you can do than wag the wiimote at the right time. Now, you have to get the positioning of the wiimote right since the 3D position can be accurately read. This means more tradition gamers can have fun with games built for the causal gamers. It will be exciting to see what developers can come up with now that 3D motion can be accurately read. I can already see a whole new level of puzzle games!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_211?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=211&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Its not the family system all the time because not everyone wants to play lack luster games. The good games come out every now and then but seldom are they considerate as far as looks. Some peripherals have their set backs, like the Wii Speak that does not allow you to use it at all if you don't have any Wii Friends. Waste of $$$ on that note. Wii Classic remote could really be used for great games like King of Fighters 12, and Street Fighter 4, if they actually considered making them for the system, but its seen as the mediocre party game system that seldom gets quality content, and thats mainly through Nintendo itself. We are waiting, but it sucks, if the Wii has more juice than the GameCube then there shouldn't be any excuse for last Gen titles with a $50 price tag slapped on them like they are worth it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_188?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=188&reviewerType=all_reviews"

And I only played the sports games that came with the system.

I started off playing boxing, which was alright, but then it got really involved. Batting practice blew me away; I had to bend my knees and step into the swing. When I practiced hitting to a certain location, it was a drill I never once did in years of sleepaway camp or gym class.

Sony and Microsoft were focusing on building the next best game systems, and they probably have (I've played Xbox 360 but not PS3). Yet with the Wii, Nintendo did something else entirely. They created an interactive experience, something you'd wait on line to try at a World's Fair.

I know I'm slow in saying it, yet with game systems, I'm hardly an early adopter; at home I have the original Nintendo Entertainment System from the 80s, still working (Dr. Mario's the current favorite). Despite many thoughts of upgrading over the past two decades, this is the first time I've ever really thought it's worth it.

All I'm left wondering now is how the heck Nintendo did it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_199?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=199&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Console - This is a great console it's lots of fun, especally in groups but also good by yourself. The graphics are not as good as a PS3 for example but they not ment be. To really enjoy this you got to get the right games like Mario Kart, Wii Sports Island, the Olympic games, any tennis game and Wii fit. If you want something for a great shoot 'um up get something else. This is great and is lots of fun for adults and children a like.
Wii Sports - It's a great game in it's self Tennis and bowling is brilliant. Boxing, golf and baseball are also fun but (sometimes)can take a while to get into them. With it's scoring system you only play computer players of your standard and and that scoring systems gives something aim for.

Each system is unique in their own way.  Wii has classical Compact Discs, 360 has red-ray HD discs and PS3 has blu-ray HD discs.  Wii discs hold the least information.  PS3 discs hold the most information.  Because of this, Wii has the worst graphics of the big three.  This provides the Nintendo gamers with an inexpensive system with inexpensive games.  Retail for the Wii and retail for new Wii game releases are significantly less than the competitors.  The prices are unbeatable and with the wireless remotes with motion sensing abilities, it is among the most unique gaming consoles ever.  It is fun for children all the way to the elderly.  It is so versatile and easy to learn that anybody can get the hang of the games.  Both family-oriented games and mature games have been released.  Wi-Fi is also compatible with the Wii so you can get online.  The Wii also has the Wii Shop Channel, which provides a gateway to the past.  Old games from NES, SNES, N64, Turbographix and Atari are available for download from the Wii Shop Channel.  On top of that, Gamecube discs slide right into the disc intake and are playable as if it were a Nintendo Gamecube.  Any gamer from the late 80's, 90's, and early 2000's should certainly buy a Nintendo Wii to relive some of the classics in the original gamer era.  Nintendo is constantly bringing out new updates and releases to enhance the game play.  For old gamers and new gamers alike, this is the gaming console from the 7th generation gaming consoles to buy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_202?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=202&reviewerType=all_reviews"

i really wish i had bought a playstation 3, a lot of the wii games are poor versions of ps3 and x box games.
i dont like the fact that you have to use the nunchuk and wiimote for games that would be so much easier to play with a standard controller - like i was really looking forward to playing call of duty, but its impossible with the wiimote and nuchuk, you end up trying your hardest just to keep your hand still so you can move properly, there is no option for a classic controller which you could rest on your knee for more control, a lot of the games are like this.
i really really dont recommend the wii if you are a hardcore gamer, you will be dissapointed.
on the other hand wii fit is very good, also Dance revolution is great fun, rock band 2 is immense, but i really would not buy a wii again just for wii fit.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_224?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=224&reviewerType=all_reviews"

And even though I hate to admit it, I think the Nintendo Wii is the best of the three. Why you may ask? It's simple. Games are supposed to be about having fun. When the Atari 2600 came out in the 80s the graphics really werent that great, but the games were a lot of fun. I place the Wii in that same category. This is really a lot of fun! Not to mention you can download all of those Atari games we all you use to love.

Nintendo is really on to a good thing when they created the motion sensored contoller too! I believe that both Microsoft and Sony will copy this genius idea. So, if you like to have fun when playing video games and just dont stare at the graphics like an ape, then I would say the Wii is for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_236?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=236&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I am what you could call a hardcore gamer. For me hidef graphics and sound, strong gameplay mechanics and deep plotlines are key factors in enjoying a game. Also I prefer to play my games alone, without interference from family or friends!!! So I guess I am not the target demographic for this console. I did however enjoy a few games that managed to hold my attention for more than a few hours. First was Super Paper Mario and the next was Metroid Prime 3. Once I finished those two though, the motivation to continue owning a wii vanished.

My husband and I play everyday and we even have Wii date nights.  If you are buying for children (especially if you have couch potatoes) the Wii is it.

Nintendo Wii is the most inovative console to date","November 22, 2006","the Nintendo Wii is the second of the seventh generation games and let me tell you all, it is so cool. after playing one at the local store, i can see why its changing the gmaeing world. for one, the controller is the best part. the wireless is amazing and so inovative. at first, its a little tricky and will feel weird but after about five minutes or so you will get the hang of it. the graphics arent the best like the Xbox or Ps3 but it still is superior to the Gamecube graphics. also, the channels are a nice addition, it can really make the console yours. i also love the backward compatitbilty, now i can play all my favorite Gamecube games unlike before. the best is the price, only 250? thats a plus in my book cause let me say i am not ready to shovel out nearly 800 dollars worth of money for the Ps3 and a game, forget it! also, some adivce, dont get the wireless for the Ps3 it is really clunky. also, i want to address all those people who are worrying and trying to get the console, lighten up! its only the first week, they are bound to be scarce. and have you checked the calender? Christmas is still a long way of, so more copies should be coming in. besides, you'll have a much better chance of getting the Wii then the Ps3 cause if you think your going to get that thing anytime soon, your crazy. do you know how back ordered that thing is? i keep on getting replies that it'll be shipped by...April or so. so overall, the Nintendo Wii is going to change the video game world. definently the thing to get.

I had tried to buy a 360 when it came out in 05 but was unable too. After breaking down different equipment and games I would want for each system the Wii was actually only about 50 cheaper. The two part controllers are a bit expensive and I wanted a memory card and component cables. You could really get away with a lot less if you're a casual gamer though.

  I decided to get the Wii because of the new way to play Madden, Legend of Zelda and Wii Sports. I'm so glad I did. Not only are the games that sold me the system awesome, it's something everyone can play.

  I've played Wii Sports with my Grandma, my father, my niece and nephew, and my wife. And all my Video game friends as well. It only takes a few seconds for anyone to pick up and play the Wii Sports games.
  Some of the Games are more complicated like Madden and Call of Duty. But the controls really draw you into the game and you feel more a part of it than you would if you played it with a regular controller.

  Nintendo still doesn't have very many mature games; there are games I would like to be playing on the 360 like Lost Planet, Dead Rising, and Gears of War. This is going to change soon as Scarface and Godfather are coming to the Wii. And the Wii Controller works well in FPS such as Red Steel and Call of Duty, so I expect more will be coming.

  Graphically the Wii will never match up against the 360 or PS3. Some people may be a bit disappointed that most of the games graphics don't seem noticeably improved over the Gamecube. But a few games like Need for Speed show the Wii has potential

  There is really no online yet like Xbox Live, and from the news reports it sounds like it will never be quite as great as Xbox Live anyway, because you'll only be able to play with people who gave you their friend code. Which you won't be able to trade on Wii online. You'll have to know the person someway else.

  All in all I'm very pleased with my decision to get the Wii. Madden, Call of Duty, Wii Sports, and Legend of Zelda are 4 of the best games out right now for any system. Rayman Raving Rabbids and Excite Trucks are two enjoyable games that I play often and with friends as well. I don't think Red Steel and Need for Speed are particularly good games but I keep finding myself coming back to play them.

  In addition the Nintendo Virtual Console lets you trade Wii Points for classic NES, SNES, Genesis, Turbo-grax, and N64 games. While there is only about 60 games out for it, the selection is much better then Xbox Live Arcade and about 3 more come out each week. I have about 10 classic games already, it's almost like having all those systems in the Wii.

  I would definitely recommend the Wii over the 360 or the Ps3 right now. Unless you're a big fan of the 360 exclusives or wanted a Blu-Ray player.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_186?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=186&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My only complaints:
1.  Should support 720p or even 1080p video.  The graphics are somewhat out of date.
2.  If you have three kids, you can't just buy this.  You also have to buy extra controllers and other accessories to get the most of it.  The total package really adds up.

This specific set (the main unit, one Wii remote, and _Wii Sports_) is enough to get you started, but really, it should be viewed as only partial. Because only a couple games can be played with multiple people and one Wii remote, it would be helpful if one more remote came with the unit. Check for prices and you will quickly see why! It's not really a complete system with only one remote. Most people will likely want at least two.

Disabilities and the Wii

Much has been said about the Wii being used in retirement homes with the elderly, as well as with the disabled. Due to health issues, our family has now been doing activities together that we haven't been able to do in years. However, playing most of the games in a sitting position is difficult, and people who lack motor skills will have a difficult time with some functions, such as pushing buttons at once or letting go of a button at the right time. Coordination is important, and this has proven a bit of a challenge at times.

_Wii Sports_ features five games: baseball, boxing, bowling, golf, and tennis. Game play is easy and mostly straightforwardly similar to real-life play of each game. The graphics on _Wii Sports_ are cute, but not what one might expect in a game today. The backgrounds are more impressive than the ""Miis"" (little personalized icons). The baseball game even removes the arms and legs of Miis!

Some of the ""filler,"" especially in the baseball game, seems slow, and the filler can't always be skipped by pressing a button, and this grows frustrating at times. Instructions on how to play the games and what different on-screen icons mean is somewhat vague at times.

What I really enjoy is the fitness test, which can be taken daily. There are little mini practice games for each sport, such as batting practice. Once these are played, they are unlocked and show up at random in the fitness test. You can track your progress and improvement over time. This game also grows with you by saving your progress and giving you more difficult computer opponents as your skill level progresses.

Adding On

If you already have a Nintendo GameCube, you're in luck. Nintendo has made it so that much of what you have is likely compatible for play on the Wii--with the Wii operating as a GameCube of sorts. If you don't already have GameCube components, getting the Wii is also like getting a GameCube, though you will need to buy extra components to set it up as such (memory card, controllers, and games). Unfortunately, not much information is supplied by Nintendo on how this works, and it took research before I realized that the Wii remote could not double as a controller for GameCube games. On the positive side, people are getting rid of these items and they are selling for low used prices now.

At the time of this review, Nintendo has upgraded only the add-on units (such as the Wii controller and _Wii Fitness_) rather than the main unit, which is a welcome change from the way technology becomes obsolete the moment you purchase it.

Aside from games and accessories that can be added on, the Wii also has Internet connectivity that Nintendo is still (at the time of this writing) actively updating.

Overall, we have found the Wii to be a welcome unit in our home that has enabled us to have family time and lots of fun. I hope you enjoy it, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Zberg","It's just something to do when there's nothing else going on","January 10, 2010","The Wii for me:  I have had the Wii for about 2 months and I am not very impressed. I have not found a game for Wii that I can get lost in for hours or even a game that I really look forward to playing. Instead, it's more of a cure - or a band-aid - for boredom.

The truth about gameplay:  You cheat. Most everyone cheats. People don't hold the remote like a baseball bat or a golf club; they hold it with one hand and do half hearted swings. This has been the case with every game I've played thus far. Also, holding a remote or gun up to the screen is not something I can do for hours. Mario Kart is the only game that I can play with my arms on my lap.

The fitness aspect:  Using the Wii for fitness (I have Wii fit & EA Active) may work for seniors or pregnant women but for the vast majority, it's a joke. Run in place, move your arms around and balance on one leg etc...  If you are serious about getting in shape, don't count on the Wii to help you.

For get-togethers:  The Wii is fun with other people. If you have people over a lot or live in a dorm-like setting, the Wii could be a bonus but I don't remember going over to anyone's place specifically to play some Wii.

The people I have noticed that like the Wii:  Nintendo junkies, parents, younger kids, and people in dorms.

The people I have noticed that don't like the Wii:  Singles 18-35 that enjoy rated R movies and don't go to church.

The Wii is not horrible. It's not exactly fun either. It's just something to do when there's nothing else going on.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_222?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=222&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was finally able to purchase it at a very good price but still had my doubts. For one thing, I was worried about how much space it would take up. I HATE clutter, and I did not want a bunch of stuff sitting around. No problems here. The unit itself is very small, and the accessories can be neatly stored in the entertainment center. I also worried about the physical space I'd need since our family room is cozy. Yes, we've hit a couple things, but after readjusting we seem to be fine.

Oh, I was also worried about installation. Not a problem. It installed quickly and easily and began working seamlessly.

This unit came with the Wii sports package. We got the Wii about four days ago and have been playing with it for hours every day. It's a good workout too. Yes, I was a bit sore after playing the first day, but that just tells me I'm out of shape (already knew it) and need to keep playing to get in better shape.

In my opinion, the two best games are bowling and tennis. I found the boxing to be great for stress reduction, but it's much more taxing than the other games. Perhaps when I'm in better shape I'll find it more enjoyable. I haven't quite figured out how to do well in the baseball game, but again time will tell.

Bowling and tennis, however, are lots of fun and provide an excellent workout.

I am very pleased with this purchase. I feel strongly that I will be in much better shape in a year with the help of this game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_179?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=179&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It wasn't until Christmas of that same year when I finally came to own a Wii. To be completely honest, I was very impressed with the Wii's ability to detect my movements simply with the flick of the Wii controller.

When I first looked at the console itself, I noticed it was extremely tiny compared to the Playstation 2 or the Xbox 360. At the same time, however, it is much heavier than it looks--as Nintendo made use of every single space they could find in this system.

I've always seemed like the kind of person who couldn't sit still while playing a game--and this system only quenches my thirst to move while playing games. Games like Super Mario Galaxy, Sonic Colors, and Godzilla Unleashed all require me to move my body in order to emerge victorious in the game.

While it is a pleasure to know that this console gives me the ability to interact with my games through movement, older Nintendo fans may be pleased to know that you can insert and play Nintendo GameCube games thanks to the Wii's backwards compatibility with its predecessor. All you need to do this is a GameCube controller, a memory card, and a GameCube game itself. For those of you who want to go even FURTHER into Nintendo's past, you have the option to hook up your Nintendo Wii to the Internet and go to the ""Wii Shop"", where you can buy many old games for the NES, Sega Genesis, Nintendo 64, and much more.

Overall the Nintendo Wii is a fantastic home console. Even though its day are numbered and it is about to be replaced by the more powerful Wii U, I cannot tell you how much fun I have had with this console.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_175?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=175&reviewerType=all_reviews"

One night, we played it, and it was pretty fun.  I didn't experience any problems with it that night.  Then the next afternoon, I tried to navigate the Wii menus, and the pointer on the screen moved around very erratically as I moved the controller around.  I wasn't sure why that was happening, as it didn't happen the previous night.  I tried to play some games, but it didn't work very well.  Then later at night, I tried it again, and the pointer was very smooth.  I did not see any of the jerky/erratic movement that I saw during the day.  Turns out the problem was due to sunlight coming into the house during the afternoon.  My cousin has her TV set up against a wall that has some windows and a glass sliding door, so a lot of sunlight was coming in directly at me and the Wii controller.  That screws up the Wii sensors.  I did a search on the internet for ""wii"" and ""sunlight"" and other people have the same problem.  Although the Wii is pretty fun (at night), I will wait for Nintendo to fix this problem in the next version of the Wii before I buy it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_184?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=184&reviewerType=all_reviews"

""the hardcore gamers""); as one, I can tell you that you'll find a good selection of games in the Wii's gallery, but not with the depth or quantity of any of the previous generation of consoles; as such, it looks that most of the games the Wii is getting right now are focused more on this ""casual"" new market, and the games more traditionally aimed (or ""hardcore"") are being developed for other systems (PS3 or Xbox 360); in addition to this, Wii doesn't support HD graphics, which isn't all that important, but when you're playing Zelda: Twilight Princess or Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, and you also have any of the other two consoles, it's difficult not to wonder how would it look if the Wii had all that other technology (even if the gameplay is truly revolutionary).

The Wii can even pick your internet connection wirelessly if you have a router. This allows you to surf the net and connect WiiConnect24.

However, I found I enjoyed several Mario games, than many of the sports titles.  The Tiger Woods golf games are probably the best sports games on the Wii Console, but for whatever reason, it gets old playing it over time.  It is also disappointing that the best tennis game on the Wii is on Wii Sports.  The Mario games that I've played are terrific though.  From Super Mario Galaxy to Super Mario Bros., Mario games will keep you entertained for hours.  If you need a break from that, the Wii Sports or Wii Sports Resort is a lot of fun, especially when playing with at least one other person.  Overall, I would say I have a great deal of fun with the Wii, just some games, like on any system will be a little repetitive over time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_189?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=189&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have owned it for a couple years now.  The controllers have never had a problem (and they have been through considerable abuse).  My only reason for giving it a 4/5 is that it isn't HD.  Come on! they should have at least given consumers the option to have true HD picture quality.  As an older gamer (over 21...) I have been spoiled by the graphics of PC and Xbox 360 games.  The Wii is not just slightly worse either.  There are times I have trouble reading the numbers or letters on the screen because of the low resolution.  It drives me crazy!  It is particularly irritating because everything else about it is so awesome!  The menus are intuitive and the controllers are an epic step forward for gaming.
I own both the Xbox 360 and the Wii.  I have played several games for both systems (simpsons, call of duty, need for speed) and in all three instances I prefer the Xbox versions of the games.  I can honestly say it is much more fun to play the Wii games because of the level of interactivity, but all of the games are much 'lighter' adaptations for the Wii.  Since the Wii doesn't read discs with as much information on them, the games end up resembling the Xbox versions, but with many extras trimmed off.  By this I mean story lines are gone, options are absent, and the levels/worlds/stages are always lacking details.

Bottom line:
Wii is great for simple games (brain age, wii sports, etc. but if you are into games like forza, call of duty, etc. you best stick with another console.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_185?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=185&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Even with some urging from him, I would find it hard to get involved in the games. Not so with the Wii. We got this just ahead of the Memorial weekend and throughout the weekend, we NEVER switched on the TV for watching some show. All of us - myself, my not-at-all-techie-wife and son - got hooked.

The technology behind the Wii is just amazing. It is incredible how swinging the remote in space can be sensed correctly by the system in determining whether you made a jab or a punch or a forehand or a backhand -you get the point. This is like bringing high quality simulation to the family room. In the near future, we will soon have training games that make a person better at say, golf or any other game.

It seems that the Wii sports package that come as part of the original purchase is all that we need right now. The games - Bowling, Baseball, Tennis, Golf and Boxing - are all high quality fun. I never thought I will try Boxing, but it is the game I, as well as my wife, have enjoyed most. What's more, is it gets your arms swinging quite a bit and at the end of the day, you will end up with quite a sore arm (which is good anyway). Yes, the Wii is something you have to get up and play! Don't think you can get your daily dose of workout here, but it is better than playing a video game sitting. One fun part of the Wii sports package is the Fitness challenge. I came up rated at an age 80 :( On my defense, this has got more to do with the skill/technique required than physical abilities).

One thing that other gaming consoles boast about is higher definition (better than 480pi). But, the other dimension that the Wii provides - involvement physically - far exceeds this drawback. So far, we have just tried the Wii Sports that come with the base package. The graphics is fun and I haven't found a need to appreciate more than it is.

If you have a wall mounted TV or are planning to get one, then you will see quite a few wires that need to come of the TV. These aren't an eye-sore, but if all other wires are hidden, you may want to plan for wires-behind-the-wall.

I really haven't found something to complain about. The remote comes with a strap now that secures it to the hand and keep it from flying off and hitting nearby objects or the TV. If there can be some improvement, then built in storage to hold many games would be an advantage as one doesn't need to keep popping in and out DVDs.

Lots of fun in store for the family in this gaming system! With the summer coming up, you will have a little less to complain about your child's time with video games. Video games are better this way due to physical involvment and this can be a starting point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_175?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=175&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We got one for Christmas this year and finally decided to write a review of it.

Simply put, the Nintendo Wii does things that no gaming console has ever done before.  It gets the entire family (and their bodies) in motion.  The included ""Sports"" game is, as many others have stated, a very basic game, but it is very fun.  Tennis, Bowling, Baseball, Boxing and Golf are all offered on the game, and each of them requires some level of mobility from the player.  In tennis you actually swing the racket.  In bowling you actually bowl the ball (and can put a little English on it, too).  Baseball allows you to pitch and bat, and you can alter the direction of both with how you move the Wii controller (or by pressing buttons during delivery).  The golf game can be just as aggravating as the real thing, and you must vary the strength of your swing to get a good shot.  There are also fitness and training options on the game that can give you your ""Wii"" age.

The most strenuous (and most fun) game on the ""Sports"" disc has to be boxing.  You literally have to bob, weave and juke your way around the ring in order to avoid getting hit by your opponent.  As with the other games, your level of skill increases with each match you compete in, win or lose.  The Sweet Science has never been much sweeter in a video game such as this one.

Setting up the console was simple.  Simply follow the instructions and you'll be fine.

Once you've got the console set up, you can then begin to personalize it.  You maneuver through the Wii's menu options via ""channels.""  There's the game channel, which plays games (including GameCube games), as well as the Mii Channel, a weather, news, photo and internet channel.  While I have only used the Mii and Game channel, I have had friends tell me that the other channels work very well once they are hooked to your internet connection.

The Mii channel is almost a game in itself.  On this channel, you create your individual character that can be used in some Wii games.  After creating your character, you are given the option to let it ""mingle"" in a room with other created characters.  Some of these characters will show up as your ally or opponent in games, adding to the ""personalization"" of the game.

As stated before, having to move around makes this console that much more fun.  It gives you a little bit of exercise without making you feel like you're ""working out.""

Highly personalized, easy to set up and very family friendly thanks to a large number of games that require multiple players to get up and move, the Wii will be a hit in any home.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I am not a computer whiz so I was please with the simplicity to set it up, any one can do it.  I absolutely recomend this product. I am having great time wether by my self or with some friends, It can bring a lots of fun for the whole family. I love the fact that you can read the news, browse the Internet, with some limitacions- without connecting your computer to your TV. I have only one complain or regret that I cannot stream my pictures as slide show from my computer, only from a SD Card. Given that you have a broadband Internet Service, I do.  Will I buy again or recommend Amazon?, Absolutely, I already order some extra remotes and got them too. Thanks Amazon.  Edgar

Now they are having a hard time playing it because I am on every spare minute I have and I even find myself making time to play it.  Between myself and my children we have had all of the Nintendo systems, Sega, Play Station 1-2-PSP, Nintendo Game Boy-Color, SP, DS Lite.  The Nintendo Wii is a blast to play the wireless remotes work well, it has the option to use wired remotes either classic Wii (sold seperatly) or it is compatible with Game Cube remotes.  I did buy the Nintendo USB Wireless internet connection.  I have a Westell VersaLink router modem for my computers internet connection.  I tried to use the wireless internet option with the Wii and the modem but I kept having problems with the setup(probably my inexperience with wireless networking) so I bought the USB adapter for the DS and Wii.  It was easy to set up (you will need a dsl or broadband internet connection and Windows XP)and I have not had a problem with the connection since I set it up.  I rated the Wii 4 out of 5 stars because of the graphics or lack of.  The X-Box, PlayStation 2 and 3, PSP, are much better with the graphics.  But to be honest I just love the Wii.  I have played 9 different games and just bought four more.  My kids are having so much fun getting up and interacting with the games.  They are not just sitting on the couch pushing buttons.

If you are going to buy a Wii system the only accessories I would recommend are an extra wireless remote and an extra nunchuk controller.  You do get one of each with the system and some games you can use one controller for two or more players.  Also if you do not have a wireless modem the USB Nintendo internet connction is easy to set up.  Some people say that there are cheaper USB adapters but the Nintendo USB Adapter($34.95) comes with a disc that you put in the computer follow the steps and you are connected to the internet via the Wii.  Another advantage of the wireless connection is that Nintendo has made some of its most popular games from Nintendo, NES, Sega, etc for download to the Wii memory.  You can buy Wii points either through the Wii connection with a credit card or a Nintendo Wii Points Card from stores that sell game systems.  I bought 3000 Wii points for $30 through my Wii connection.  I bought Super Mario Bros for 500 points.  The first Mario Bros is 500 points, Donkey Kong is 600 points, and more.  It's a blast from the past.  My son has a Nintendo Game Cube, we can play the games he has in the Wii also.

There are alot of accessories becoming available for the Wii.  To set up the system most are not necessary.  The system comes with a stand, built in memory, sensor bar for wireless remotes, one wireless remote, one wireless nunchuk, a/v cables, power adapter, 5 game sample disc.  Memory cards are only for saving Game Cube game information, Wii game info is stored on the Wii memory.

I usually do not leave detailed reviews like this one, but the game is so much fun to play. Also I had so many questions about what I needed to set it up. I hope this review helps you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_222?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=222&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sure the games are a bit pricey, but the Virtual Console option gives people in our age range the option to buy the games we played from ""back in the day"", and still get schooled on all the latest crazes.  The remotes are a little time consuming, but once you have the hang of it, it is so much fun.  I suggest buying a classic controller, even though the button configuration is not totally the same when playing a classic like Super Mario Bros.  I also purchased a gamecube controller, and use it more, so i guess it is a personal preference choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_230?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=230&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But, Nintendo chose to focus on the casual/party gamer rather than on people who like to play detailed/challenging games.  It's a smart move because people quickly get bored with unchallenging games and buy new ones as a result.  This means more $ for Nintendo.  After having a Wii for almost 1 year, I've only kept one game that I've bought.  After learning my lesson, I'll never buy a game before renting it first.

I don't mean to sound too negative because that one game I kept is probably my favorite game of all time and the motion controls are better than just clicking buttons and moving a joystick.  But, things could be better.  For example, one of the strengths of the console is the online play because it's much more fun to play against another person than it is to play against the computer.  Unfortunately, the online play is being destroyed by hackers who either cheat to win or just do it to make sure everybody else is miserable.  Nintendo can do something about it and has temporarily punished the Mario Kart hackers a few times.  However, after a few days, those people are back online and still hacking.  So, I give the Wii 5 stars for innovativeness and 1 or 2 stars for games and online play.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_241?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=241&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Davis","Great Console, Lousy Games","September 19, 2008","The Nintendo Wii, which was released back in 2006, is a fun and unique gaming console. It is much like other video game systems in that you just need a TV and a power outlet to hook it up and play. What sets this console apart from the others, however, is the motion sensing controller (aka wii remote or wiimote). Along with the controller, the Nintendo Wii is also relatively cheap. Actually, this is not entire true as throughout its history, the Wii has been in short supply. This means that finding one may cost you more than Nintendo wants retailers to charge (sometimes a lot more).

As said before, the biggest thing the Wii has going for it is the controller. The wii remote has all kinds of fancy parts which allows people to control some games, simply through movement. A good example of a game like this is actually the one that comes with the console: ""Wii Sports"". It's fun, simple, entertaining and is a great example of what the wii remote can do.

Wii Sports is a decent game and most people will enjoy it, however, the fact that it is the most well known game on the system is a bad sign. Actually it's more than a sign and there is a reason the system does not have many well known games which is simply because it has hardly any half decent games at all! It doesn't matter if you are into action games, sports games, puzzle games, role playing games, racing games, simulation type games, strategy games, fighting games, adventure games, or even educational games; the Wii just does not have a good software selection.

The lack of any good games is a huge problem for the Wii. Untill the Wii can get some good software it is just barely worth buying at this point. There's potential here, but that is all, just potential.

Pros:

- The size of the console itself is very small and is nice to look at.
- The innovative controller can be fun and simple to use.
- In theory the system is cheap.
- Wii Sports is a great party game.

Cons:

- Wii Remotes are expensive. ($40 for the remote and 20$ for the nun chuck. Since you will need 3 more of each to play four player games, this will add up quickly.
- Nintendo has not kept up with demand, thus causing market prices to increase.
- The number of good games can be counted on one hand, and of those games many may not even be the type that you like.

*EDIT 7/11/09*

Nintendo, thankfully has gotten a good number of wiis in stores (finally) so finding one is no longer difficult. Prices are now going to be consistent which is great for any potential buyer. Seriously, if cost was a problem before it shouldn't be anymore since you will no longer be paying more than MSRP.

That said, there is one new problem that I found which wasn't mentioned in the original review; that being the battery life of the wii remotes. It seems like I'm replacing those two AA batteries very often. I'm gonna give a ballpark estimate of about 30 hours of use but don't take that number too seriously. Also, they seem to drain even when not in us, though at a MUCH slower rate.

I still think the wii is a wonderful piece of hardware that Nintendo did a fantastic job creating. However, I also still think the system has way too few good games on it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_221?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=221&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I love how fun this system is, it is much more immersive than any other home console I've played.  The controls help to make games feel more realistic than the typical button mashing that I've been used to doing.  Graphically it is a minor step up from the previous generation, which doesn't bother me too much because of the fun I have with the system and I own a Xbox 360 so I have my High Def gaming along with the Wii.  I just recently hooked my Wii up to my new HDTV and to me it has made an improvement on the picture, just not a great improvement like you'll see with a PS3 or Xbox 360 unfortunately.  I also like how Nintendo has set up the Virtual Console so I can play my old favorites like Super Mario Bros and other classical games.  And it's $250 bucks, can't beat a very good and unique console at that price.  The reason I gave it a 4 for overall is that at some point I like to play some High Def games, but as far as fun is concerned it is a definite 5 for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I mean 'Wii', but importantly it's F-U-N!","May 9, 2008","I waited. I waited several months after the Nintendo Wii came out to buy it, and after one year of using it I am ready to write my review on this product. There is more than one reason to buy the Nintendo Wii: the most important reason is the fun factor.

You may have heard that this is only a gimmick system, like the ill-conceived Virtual Boy and (I dare say it) PlayStation 3, because of Wii-remote controllers used to move the action in the game by actually moving the controllers. Such an idea, critics have said, is to cover up the flaws of the system and the product line, the lack of graphics compared to an X-Box360 and the number of games compared to the PlayStation line. What I have found since my days of video gaming began with PONG and actually having to pay to play 'Donkey Kong' that pretty, tight, and sexy graphics mean absolutely nothing in terms of replay value: the pretty colors and characters are there to cover up the flaws.

I admit the Nintendo Wii, with its base game 'Wii Sports', is not graphics pretty, but Nintendo once again focuses on that 'F-U-N' factor of game play with system ownership: a concept lost on its rivals. With the Wii Remote Controller you have incredible interactivity: use it as a pointer to select your options on the Wii Menu to using it achieve goals in the games you play. The motion sensing of the remote can be adjusted to create either a loose or tight response with little lag. Be it selecting a button, or having to perform a swinging motion to swing the 'Wii Sports' batter in baseball or in tennis or in golf, or jab it forward in boxing, or underhand throwing in my favorite bowling, the Wii Remote just about perfects the remote video controller concept. Sure, again, the graphics of the in-game is not great, but after a year I'm still playing them. Again, it's all about FUN! And once again, Nintendo also emphasizes the group 'all there in the living room' factor as opposed to the recent trend of playing someone else somewhere else.

Although the Wii does allow you to play with or against others around the world via a high speed internet connection it's not the only thing it can do. The Wii Network allows you access News, Weather, and a Nintendo Game Shop where you can download the classic Nintendo Games all the way back to the NES. Although you can't use the Wii Remote on these games the hard link controllers are cheap to get. Plus for Nintendo Game Cube owners don't toss your GCN stuff away: the Wii plays Game Cube games, uses the memory cards and the controllers.

Since the year and the half the system has been out, innovation is finding its way to the system, as well as the games. The Nintendo Wii is not a gimmick: it's an honest game system that is cheap, doesn't demand that you buy it for it's DVD or BluRay capability, and once again F-U-N!!!!! to have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_180?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=180&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm not a big 'gamer' so I didn't think I would really take advantage of the other systems.  The Wii sounded great because of all the family games that can be played.  After having the Wii for several months, I can happily say, it was the perfect choice.

I was able to get the Wii when Amazon had an open box unit available.  For folks trying to get one, I was looking every day for several weeks.  I didn't spend huge amounts of time on it, but whenever I remembered, I would check out different online stores and I finally lucked out on Amazon!

If you don't know yet what gaming system to get, what really helped me was to take a look at the games available for each system and see which I thought I would actually play.  Also, I went to the electronics section at my local Target and tested out the systems there.  I've seen people playing the systems at Walmart, too.  I'm sure all the stores that sell these gaming systems have them out so people can try them.  Anyway, all the systems seem very well made but the Wii was easier for me to play and seemed like a fun family system.

And what makes the Wii even sweeter, is the great Christmas gift I got!  Rockband with a wireless guitar.  Sooooooo much fun!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The point is, Wii gets you off the couch and requires you to socialize! This system is for multiple people! And it's fun!

You are not wasting away exercising your fingers here. You are actually up and jumping around, it's incredibly fun to play wii tennis with a friend. This is a very social system, and is really what video games have been missing. Between playing a long, solitary game that requires me to expend no energy, and playing the wii which is unbelievable work of accomplishent on nintendo's part.

I think the graphics are fantastic from what I've seen, and most importantly, everyone -- even people who don't like video games -- loves to play it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Living in colder weather where it snows and is very cold outside makes it difficult to get in daily walking. I have found the Wii gives me plenty of exercise and it is fun! I would recommend a Wii to everyone. In fact, I encouraged my sister to purchase a Wii and now we meet once a week to do our yoga together. Wii is a system that is easy to put together and easy to use. No, it does not have all the special graphics that today's computer games have, but it is perfect for any age that just wants to move. When I can't go outside I can run, walk, bowl, play games, and keep busy all day in my house.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

STUNNED","November 19, 2006","I figured there's so many people writing BS reviews I'd throw a real review up.  I picked mine up at Wal-Mart, and I'm JUST reviewing the system + Wii Sports (haven't played the other games).

What can I say.... this is.. GREAT.

""But you only gave it 4 Stars!"", you may be saying (or maybe not).

Well, yeah, I did.  There are some issues, particularly with the Wiimote... it seems a little... touchy.  And this MAY be user error, or may require another firmware update.  Honestly, if I could, I'd give it **** 1/2 or **** 3/4.  But without playing any other games, I can't give just the console itself a solid ***** rating... yet. :-)

One thing I can say regarding the Wiimote and Sensor bar: Experiment.  Find what works.  I may still have some more playing to do before I can get it just right.

Another minor letdown is the UI.  I consider myself fairly intuitive with user interfaces, and there were a few spots that had me scratching my head.  Nothing major, but I'd like to see this cleaned up in a later release of the firmware.

The console itself is physically stunning... I'm serious.  This machine is a beautiful, elegant example of engineering.  The Wiimote and Nunchuck are virtually weightless.  I barely felt they were there.  The console itself is beautiful.  Much better looking than the PS3.

As I said, the only game I've played so far is Wii Sports... it's the perfect pack in for the Wii.  The only word to describe this game is ""FUN!""  I've played through all the games, and the Tennis and boxing games are my favorites.  Bowling's kinda lame, and golf is okay.  Baseball is fun too.  Overall, a great package.  I know they say you can sit on the couch and make small movements, but... no... GET UP AND MOVE! :-)

Overall, I'm happy with my purchase, and I highly recommend picking one up.  I've also got Zelda, Rayman, Trauma Center, and Super Monkey Ball to go through, and I will review those as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_269?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=269&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, when you start trying to get stuff for it, you think you have it all and then you find out you need more stuff.

For instance, you can play Gamecube games on a Wii console, but no one ever says you need a Gamecube memory card to play them as well.

Or, Wii fit, which is a steal at $19.99, but requires a $96.00 balance board to play.

Or, you don't have a wireless router, or wireless service, and the Wii only has Wi-Fi capability unless you know that there is an adapter that can make it able to be physically wired to the internet. Which you will never find out about that unless you think of it. Then when you do think of it, there is a question of the type of Ethernet cable you need and how long the cable needs to be. (Which the cable type is category 5.)

Basically, I love my Wii system, I wouldn't trade it for the world, but if you're going to buy one, realize that it's not just a console and couple games you're buying. You have to buy a lot more than you think. There's additional wii-motes, nunchucks, boards, plugs, adapters, and lots more that you may not think you need, but are vital to the running of the gaming programs on the Wii.

So to people new to the Wii gaming system, be sure to do your research and find out whether or not you are willing to make the various and costly investments.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_182?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=182&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Whats Good:

1.Virtual Console allows you to download games from The NES-N64 + Turbo Grafix and Sega Genesis

2.Games are VERY fun to play and come cheap like around 30-50$(as compared to Xbox 360/PS3 where some of their games range from 50-70$)

3.Can Play Gamecube games as well as Wii games (Duh)

4.Controller is very easy to use despite how it looks

5.The console isnt Gynormous *looks at a PS3*

The Bad:

1.Inferior graphics to PS3/X360

2.Online Service is not too good (as mentioned many times before you have to have friend codes)

3.Controller is EXPENSIVE sorta like the X360 Wireless controller as i have heard (I dont know actual price so dont yell at me if im wrong)

Down-Right Pointless *2  *2=randon  stupid stuff (meant to be funny)

1.You have to connect another cord

2.You need to connect a nunchuck to the controller for most games","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_253?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=253&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Zacharias","Amazing System","November 27, 2006","I haven't owned a game system since the original NES years ago.  My reason for not getting any new systems is that the controls have gotten too confusing and difficult to use.  Now with the Wii they have made the controls simple again.  I must say that I was surprised how well the controls worked as I didn't think they would respond so well.  This console has turned out to be a lot of fun for me and my family.

Here are the games that we have been playing:

Wii sports - really shows you what the new controller scheme can do and give you a workout in the process.

Zelda: Twilight Princess - I have always avoided games like this because the controls have been a pain to master (which was shown my my frequent deaths during the course of the game which made me give up).  However, the Wii controller finally makes this possible for any average joe to play.  It is the longest that I have ever played any sort of adventure game this this in my life and that is saying something.  The story is interesting and can take up hours of your life without you even realizing it.

Rayman Raving Rabbids:  If you want a fun game that is a challenge but will make you laugh as its silliness than this is the game for you.  It makes full use to the new controller and will make you laugh each time one of the bunnies comes running at you screaming.  Oh, and having bunny backup dancers is a good time too.

This system is by far the best system that has been released in years.  It is by far the most fun I have had playing video games since the late 80s.  Wii is worth your time and money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_213?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=213&reviewerType=all_reviews"

What happened to the Nintendo Revolution?!","December 20, 2013","Out of all the consoles released during this last generation, Nintendo’s Wii was the hardest for me to warm up to. Nintendo’s apparent lack of interest for the core gaming crowd in favor of casual gamers was already in full force by the time I finally received this console as a gift around 2009. By that time, I had already gotten over the cheap gimmicks Nintendo was pumping into the market and ready to move onto what I thought was bigger and better things. It didn’t help that the Wii library seemed like it was filled with nothing but cheap shovel ware, or tired first party titles like Mario and Zelda that never go down in price. I decided that most of the games weren’t worth my time and saved up my money for a PS3 instead. Now that it's the Wii U’s time to shine, I had a renewed interest to go back and play some games that I missed out on. After going back and playing the Wii for the last three months, I have to say, that it was really wrong of me to dismiss the console like I did. In this amount of time, I was having more fun on the Wii that I was having on my PS3 during the first year that I owned it. The Wii really is a great game console because there are games that everyone can enjoy, regardless if you are a self-proclaimed hardcore or casual gamer.

One of the best things about the Wii is its bargain price. With the PS3 and 360 costing somewhere around $300 dollars, the Wii’s price is definitely an advantage amongst its competition. Unfortunately the price starts to speak for itself, because the Wii looks and feels cheaply made. The console itself feels very thin and the white outside of the console feels like cheap plastic. It doesn’t look or feel very sturdy at all, especially without it’s little gray stand. There are little flaps on top of the console for gamecube controllers and memory card to go in, but the damn things are so delicate and cheap that they are easy to unhinge and fall off. Also the white color of the console can get very dirty and scuffed up very easily, especially around little kids. Just holding the console feels like it’s really flimsy. However, despite it’s initial appearance, the Wii is actually made really well. I have dropped it on a few occasions by accident and even though it’s outward appearance is nothing special, the inside of the console is very reliable. I’ve rarely had problems with the Wii in terms of freezing, crashing, or being stuck in menus. Even when the rare occasion that this does happen, it’s very easy to reset the Wii and run everything again like normal. Given the amount of dust that was on the machine and how much I’ve neglected it, the console runs really well from all the abuse I’ve put it through. To put it in comparison, I’ve had to go through two Gamecubes in the same amount of time I've had my Wii. Nintendo was a lot smarter about designing this console and I've never had any disk reading errors unlike the gamecube.

Nintendo’s consoles have never been known to boast any special features. When you buy a Nintendo console, you get it for games and nothing else. This straightforward policy is obviously there to avoid making the console more expensive for consumers. It makes sense, because I can’t see how sticking on a DVD player would be that big of a selling point, especially when Blu Ray was already the standard on the market. Nintendo did manage to add a little more this time around, by having separate channels open for access on the Wii’s main menu. These channels are pretty much pointless I really can’t see the point of using them maybe once or twice to see what they do and then never using them again. The only one that can be fun is the Mii channel in which you can create a kind of avatar based on your appearance. It can be a cute little distraction to make models of your family but it's nothing special.The most useful option is the Nintendo store, which operates like almost any other PSN or Xbox store, where you can download games and some add ons for money. Also by some grace of God, Nintendo was smart enough make the Wii Netflix compatible, which is a great decision as far as I’m concerned.

It’s easy to see that the Wii isn’t going to wow anybody in terms of graphical power and performance. Even when it was out,  its design and options were very dated and made to appeal to people who don’t really play video games. There aren't a lot of social options, online play is almost non existent, and there isn't much room for customization or things to do when not playing games. Nintendo’s stubbornness to venture into online territory really held back the Wii and there are a number of games available that would have benefited from actual online play. Most of the games with online options are so limited, that they really aren't worth playing more than a few times.

Putting aside online issues, the Wii has what matter most. It's expansive library of games. I really mean it when I say there are some awesome titles on the system that no one has heard of and very fun to play. It’s a shame that so many hardcore gamers disregarded the Wii so quickly, because there are a lot more games on here than they give it credit for. Games like No More Heroes, Metroid Prime 3, Red Steel 2, Madworld, Silent Hill: Shattered Memories, Donkey Kong Country Returns, Excitebots, Trauma Center, Kirby’s Epic Yarn, Super Mario Galaxy, and Xenoblade are more recognizable and are easily some of the best games I’ve played last gen. I got more value and more fun playing some of these games than I did shelling out top dollars for PS3 exclusives.  Where the Wii really shines though, is other lesser known gems like Boom Blox, Cursed Mountain, Sin and Punishment 2, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, Bully, Ghost Squad, De Blob, House of the Dead Overkill, Sonic Colors, Lost in Shadow, Klonoa, Muramasa, Metal Slug Anthology. The list goes on and I still left out quite a few games. All these games are easily worth your time and money and should be played by anyone who has even the slightest interest in video games. What makes these games special, is that many of these games are actually very unique. I've yet to play anything like De Blob or Lost in Shadow on the PS3 or have played any RPG that has gotten close to being as good as Xenoblade. Tatsunoko vs Capcom is leagues better than MvC3, No More Heroes is refreshingly cool, Sin and Punishment 2 has hardcore shooting action, and Donkey Kong Country Returns is one of the best 2D platforms I've played since the Super Nintendo era.

Wii’s motions controls work just as well as you would expect, if not better in some cases.  I’ve never ever had problems with it not reading movement or misinterpreting my gestures for almost all the games I’ve played so far. There are some later games released that utilize a Wii Motion Plus add on to allow for even more precise movement. With that said, the problem with these controls lies with how the game developers make you use them. As time has shown, many developers have had a middling affair with motion controls, but nothing serious has come out of it. There a lot games out there that definitely benefit from the control scheme and then there are others where it feels completely shoe horned in, making a would be enjoyable game more difficult than necessary.  These games are usually far and few between, and all the games I’ve played have only benefited by being on the Wii remote and nunchuck.

The Wii is definitely worth owning either as a complimentary system to a PS3 of 360. I wouldn't really recommend it as your only console, because even though I had a middling experience with most HD era games, there are some games that shouldn't be missed if you only own a Wii. That said there are a lot of games worthy of your attention, regardless if you are a hardcore Sony fanboy or Microsoft fan. If you somehow don't have a Wii yet, I can safely say that you won’t regret your purchase. The overall dated policies and hardware designs may be a turn off in the beginning, but you’ll ultimately stay for the Wii’s variety unique games and gameplay that you won't find anywhere else.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_200?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=200&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I used to play video games ages ago. Now with Wii most of the games provided by default (Wii Sports) can be played with only one hand and a little flick of the wrist.. there are plenty more such games.
I brought the Wii to my office once and after just one session the team decided to get a team Wii for use in office (after hours of course :)
The Wii is amazing at getting people to exercise. Yeah, you don't just slouch in a couch; with a Wii you do have to sweat it out and it's a thousand times more enjoyable than just exercising your fingers.
I highly recommend this game for anyone with one or more hands.

Ten hours very, very well spent.

The Wii is awesomely fun, innovative, and affordable. The graphics aren't as good as the competition's, but the entertainment value makes up for it.

The Wii is fun for everyone, even my mom (who is a total non-gamer) plays Wii Sports with me. There's something about the Wii that everybody can enjoy.

I highly recommend the Wii for gamers who care about the quality and fun of the games, not just the graphics.

The Super Nintendo Entertainment System was the greatest console ever made, and I think that the Wii is going to be the next Super Nintendo.

I'm always looking for a new fun twist on video games and the Wii fits the bill.
It comes packaged with Wii Sports and just playing through each of those has provided hundreds of hours of fun for me and the family.  The motion sensitivity adds a new element of fun and interactivity which almost compels you to get off your butt and move around while playing. ;)  There are also a host of other games available now that take advantage of the motion sensitivity.  They span multiple game categories from typical platforming games to sports and even party games so I'm sure there's something for everyone to enjoy.
It was also easy to set-up and upgrade through my 128-bit WEP enabled wireless network.  There are cool free software downloads available on the Wii Shop too.  The weather channel-like program is pretty cool and has helped provide quick and accurate weather planning for the day.  The Everybody Votes channel is fun and somewhat enlightening on the opinions of Wii owners in the US and around the world.  This channel also provides a challenge element where you can guess which result will get more votes and tracks how many you've predicted correctly along with a crude breakdown of you personality, based on the answers you've given.  There is a free web browser channel as well.  It's not great but still useful for checking sites while the computer is tied-up by someone else.
I could go on and on which you have no doubt found boring already but I'll just sum it up by saying that even if you don't like video games, I think you'll have fun with the Wii.  It gets you up and moving and has something for everyone in the family to enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Although the controllers can be a bit wonky form time to time, requiring resynchronization with the base unit, that hasn't stopped the show at any time.

Is it more fun than other consoles? Yeah, without a doubt. And that's almost entirely due to the controllers. When you replicate real-world movements to activities on the screen, you really get immersed in any game. And that's hard to beat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_222?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=222&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Outside of that this is just a soccer moms bow flex that plays gamecube games. Most of what I played before I sold the wii was gamecube games and mario kart. Outside of that the wii is worse then the virtual boy! The virtual boy had a good couple of games that still play through emulation. Nothing on this console is worth revisiting. It also feeds into the idea that tells moms that violent games turn people into a murder as well as a fat jobless hog. Even when I modded my Wii it was boring. Worst console nintendo ever made except the Wii U so far which is just a last gen shovelware console that plays crappy wii games. 3DS is great though.

Estep","Pretty Good, Could Use Larger Game Library","December 29, 2008","I finally got a Wii for Christmas this year and overall have been very pleased. Everything worked like it was supposed to and the WiiSports game is very cool. I like that the Wii comes with WiiSports. It's a short set of sports games that give you a very good feel of the capabilities of the system, particularly the remote. It also gives you something to do out of the box without having to buy anything else. Granted, you'll want to get other games.

I have never been a ""gamer"" and I am also a college student. I have no problems with the graphics, but then again, my TV probably isn't good enough to make XBox 360 or PS3 graphics look any better. It is true the Wii has a larger target audience than the XBox 360 or the PS3, which is probably why it has sold so many. You will see people griping about the graphics. They would rather have a button and joystick controller in there hand and be able to see a fly from 300 yards. In my opinion they don't like the Wii for valid reasons, but they are reasons that other people don't need to have shoved down their throats.

I am disappointed that it doesn't play DVDs. I don't need it to, I have a home theater system, but it just seems like it should play DVDs. I also wouldn't expect it to play Blu-Ray discs becasue frankly Blu-Ray is a waste of money to 90% of people.

The other thing I am disappointed in is the game library. As others have pointed out, there are a ton of games like ""Petz"" and ""The Naked Brothers Band"". There are some good ones like ""Mario Party"" and ""Mario Kart"" (supposedly, can't find a copy anywhere). There are Guitar Hero games for it too, but I want to see some more games for older people, one's that aren't first person shooter games.

This system is perfect for anybody under about 13. There need to be more games to make it perfect for anybody older than that, but still worth having.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_210?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=210&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They are hard to come by and sell out quickly.

Since buying the WII I have found out that much of my body was not getting the exercise it needed.  I have never played tennis and did not understand the game terms(points).  Now I play almost everyday and understand the terms.  I can tell the difference in my body.  I love my WII.  Great for your health.

setup:

super easy and very well explained, make sure you set up in a room that allows your full arm width as you will use up a lot of space. There is also a sensor that you will have to place in front of you for the controller to work, the distance of the sensor cord (for those with projection screens) is about half a rooms length. The only thing that took a long time during setup was the updates when we hooked it up to the internet (about 10min), and you have to make an account with Nintendo.

controller:

Awesome and very intuitive, even our non-gamer friends were able to get a hang of it within a minute.

the Mii: allows you to build an avatar (sp?) which you can allow to ""travel"" and interact with other people's Wii systems. These are a blast to make, all of our friends... even those who refuse to pick up a traditional controller, had a wonderful time building there characters and sending them out in the world. Not to mention any time we get lonely there they are ;)

parents: there is ""log"" that allows you to see what games have been played and for how long, as well as parental controls so you can control what your child plays when you are not around. I highly suggest you try to play as well, it really is a lot of fun, and easier to learn then a traditional consoles.

The sports game that is included:

great starter game to get you used to the controllers, not to mention alot of fun. It also allows you to track how many calories you have burned while playing tennis, bowling, baseball, golf and boxing. (And I don't even like sport games)

Overall:

it is very, very fun to play and great for parties with people of any age (we're in our late 20's and 30's). The controls are a wonderful innovation and very natural. I would suggest this for anyone, even non gamers. Several of our friends were considering PS3 and skipping the Wii, but after playing once they are determined to get one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_202?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=202&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Wii will rock you!","December 18, 2006","I just picked up a Wii yesterday along with Marvel Ultimate Alliance, and I love both! I have not owned a game console since the days of original Nintendo and Atari. I felt very left out by the game clearly designed for either young children or obsessive young males willing to spend 8 hours on a couch twitching their thumbs. I loved Wii Sports so much I have a sore arm today from countless games of bowling, tennis and golf. Yep, even golf is entirely entertaining for hours on Wii. Can Xbox or PS say that?

To everyone who gripes that the graphics can't compare to Xbox or PS, Jar Jar Binks used better graphics than Yoda in the original Star Wars trilogy but Jar Jar was still the worst movie character in history! If graphics were the most important part of a game, no one would have played Pac Man.

The Wii's graphics are fine. Really, once you play you stop paying attention to graphics. You'll be entirely focused on hitting the pitch coming at you! I've already rushed out and bought Legend of Zelda, too. I love the game play.

The games are $5 for a NES game, $8 for a SNES and $10 for a N64.  They will also be selling Sega Genesis games and Turbograf.  Well worth the couple of dollars for hours of fun.

I've had the Wii for a couple years now and I have been nothing more than impressed. Nintendo continues to be the biggest innovator of the gaming world. Sure they may not be your huge gamer platforms, but they are the most consistent gaming company in my opinion. Yes Playstation and Xbox are both very good platforms, but they don't go out on a limb like Nintendo does. I remember when the Wii came out many people said a double controller console would fail, but as usual Nintendo delivered (as they did on ever console they've made). Come late 2012 I will be investing in their newest creation, the Wii U. They have not failed me yet, so I'm sticking with these guys.

The games on Wii are very fun. They are not overly complicated, but still very entertaining. If your a gamer that needs tons of graphics and lots of high tech games, go with the Xbox and Plystation. Though the Wii is my favorite and the most entertaining to me, I fully under stand that it lacks in the newest tech race.

All this being said, I fully recommend the Nintendo Wii. I have every Nintendo console I've ever owned since I was 5, so scooping up a Wii now (even though late) will still serve as a great investment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_174?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=174&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Now to my reviews...

BASIC REVIEW:
This console is so fun, entertaining, and versatile I would be willing to pay twice as much money for it. The backward-compatibility with GameCube games & controllers plus the ability to download classic SNES, N64, etc. games makes this the only Nintendo console you need. Additionally, the News, Weather, Everybody Votes Channel, Internet Channel, Photo Channel, and many others will serve your needs beautifully. It's very easy to use this device ten hours a day, seven days a week and not get bored of it.

DETAILED REVIEW:
In addition to what I said in my basic review, the Wii has the following:

Pros:
-Small, stylish form factor and the ability to rest horizontally or vertically make the Wii a great accent to any room.
-Motion sensor completely revolutionizes gameplay. It feels very natural to point at what you want or to turn the controller when steering a virtual vehicle. That's right. Mario Kart Wii with Wii Wheel takes advantage of this new technology to bring gamers what they've been instinctively been trying to do for years: steer by twisting the controller.
-The simple Wii remote is so easy and intuitive to use you quickly forget about it and get immersed in the game.
-Remember not being able to pause your games? Not any more. By pressing the Home button on the ""Wii-mote,"" as I like to call it, you can instantly freeze the game. On that menu one can check the battery levels in all four controllers, go directly to the home menu, get help (when using a channel), or rearrange the order of Wii-motes (1st player becomes 3rd player, for example.)
-The wireless Internet connection allows for easy software updates, game/channel downloads, and Internet viewing.
-Parental Controls can restrict children from viewing inappropriate material on the Internet, changing Wii settings, or spending money on the Wii Store.
-Portability: the Wii is the lightest full-featured console on the market and the smallest, which makes it a breeze to carry it in a case. I recommend the Wii G-pak Console Organizer Case - Black; I've been using it for months. It performed admirably during my two transcontinental flights and the Wii & accessories all came out without a scratch.

Cons:
-Motion sensor doesn't work if the Wii remote isn't aligned in front of the TV or with an unblocked line of vision to the Sensor Bar. For four people to play at once you need to sit side-by-side.
-Using a wireless router with a password more complex than a WPA password won't work with the Wii. Also, you have to type the password on the screen - not good if other people are there.
-The Parental Controls are dumb, in my opinion. By dumb I do not mean useless, I mean stupid. Instead of categorically blocking content, they can only block the entire channel. For instance, to block pornography on the Internet Channel you must restrict the whole thing, same with the Wii Shop Channel and Wii Settings. Your four-digit password is required to access them at all.
-The Wii needs an adaptor to connect using Ethernet.
-The Internet loader is pretty slow - you'll want to stick to a computer.
-When downloading items from the Wii Shop Channel, an annoying Mario runs across the screen collecting coins and occasionally hitting one of the three overhead blocks. The noise is supremely irritating; I recommend muting the TV.
-The Wii uses a moderate graphics processor - no high definition gaming like in the XBox 360 or PlayStation 3.
-It's easy to accidentally move a character on the screen when simply reaching for something in the real world - the Wii-mote's motion sensors see to that.

Overall, the cons are pretty easy to tolerate - I barely notice them. I only listed the cons so you'd have a thorough understanding of what you're going to get. The reason I brought my Wii on two transcontinental flights was because I had so much fun without it, I couldn't bare going a whole month without playing my Wii.

You might say the Wii is expensive. Two hundred fifty dollars could buy you about 50 meals. However, when compared with the XBox 360 and PlayStation 3, the Wii is much more fun (I own all three consoles and have used them extensively; the Wii reigns supreme) and cheaper. If you're thinking about getting a new game console, get a Wii. Besides, why do you think it's still sold out after a year and a half of being out? It's a wonderful device. Trust me, you'll be glad you spent the money for it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_175?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=175&reviewerType=all_reviews"

With the recent price drops I think now is a good time to do a simple comparison so I'll do my best.  I'm actually on my second wii, i bought one in 2006 at the launch and after 3 years it stopped reading discs. I think my issue was pretty isolated, but honestly I can't complain I got plenty of entertainment value out of it for the price in my honest opinion.  The only other hardware issue I have had is the lights on the remotes, they seem to burn out very quickly for me, but it doesn't ruin the function of the remote.

So how does the wii stack up against the ps3 and the xbox?  Quite honestly it really only beats the others in two departments and with the recent price drop it's more like one, but it's a biggie!  The wii is FUN, it's fun for a group of people, it's fun for people who don't play video games on a regular basis and for ones that do.  My wife and I play the wii together quite a bit, we always play it when friends visit and it's a lot of fun.  It doesn't have the graphics of the ps3 or the xbox 360, it isn't the media hub that the other two are, for the most part what the games lack in graphics they make up for easily in fun.

The controllers are innovative, the game play is innovative and prior to the price drop of the xbox and ps3 I would have said if you only buy one system the wii is definitely worth considering.  With the price drops of all of the systems the choice is not so easy now.  My recommendation, i guess would be this:  If you plan on playing a lot with friends and family when the visit and not so much by yourself or online then the wii is a solid choice.  If you plan on playing online games and playing a lot of solo games then I've got to recommend the PS3 or even the Xbox (you can see my ps3 vs xbox review for my conclusion on the winner there).

Hopefully this review will be helpful to someone doing their xmas shopping this year.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It arrived yesterday, and I have to say that I'm very impressed just like everyone else seems to be.

I just wanted to point out 2 little things about the system that aren't a big deal, but are a little annoying.

1. There's a sensor bar that senses the movements of your remote/nunchuck.  You have to attach it to the top of your tv or in front of the tv.  Makes the system hard to move from room to room, which my kids like to do.

2. The remote/nunchuck makes noises during gameplay.  And there's no way to turn the sound down.  At least as far as I know.  A problem when your kid wants to play till 3am and everyone else wants to go to bed!

Like I said, those are just small little things. The system is just great, and I'm sure we'll be getting more games and controllers soon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_225?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=225&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We have two young children that love all kinds of sports. Unfortunately they have a very inactive mom who knows nothing about sports except Yoga. Wii comes to our rescue and we are on our way to become top athletes in five sports areas that come with the initial Wii console. They are very easy to install and you can play instantly once the cables are plugged in and several bottoms pushed. My daughter (ages 5) loves especially the Mii where you create little you for the Wii games. She creates all our relatives and friends so we get huge audience to cheer and watch us play sports. She changes our hairstyles daily and adjusts Dad's weight according to his diet results. Very fun to watch! The kids love bowling, golfing and tennis. My son tries the boxing and to my relief, it is not graphic at all and in the end both opponents dance happily together. Whether going to bowling or winning the Bronze medals were illusions or not, the pain we felt the next day after the workout was certainly real.

Family","SERIOUSLY- WHO GET'S THEIR TURN FIRST!!!","January 23, 2010","Decided to get the Wii after a bit of research on the internet. My main reason for purchase was all of the positive feedback on the Wii Fit Plus. This is a additional item that you purchase in addition to the Wii gaming Console.
I was inspired for how fun it is and can be to do virtual workouts- while also losing weight and inches. While results are not drastic- It does get you up and excited to complete each day to see and track your progress. That seemed to me like a something I would enjoy. I have yet to make the purchase for the Wii fit plus- but the Wii is very fun. It's fun to watch the family aiming at things as though they exist in front of them. The control has a nice gel pad for added protection from the unexpected (Accidental tossing of the remotes). LOL!!! It has a bit of sound and vibrations that come from it as you use or play the item. While my family is not completely the gamer type- The Wii has options. The item arrived within days from Amazon- and I appreciate the fact that I do not have to pay tax on items I order from them.

Drouin","Gets some major things right, but leaves out some other major features","December 14, 2008","The Wii is a console of perplexing decisions. Revolutionary control scheme? It has that, but the hardware in the wiimote lacks accuracy for finer movements, leaving most games to rely on broad, simple strokes and the pointer features.

How about the built in wi-fi? This is a fantastic feature, and it's great to see it on such a low priced unit. But it lacks a built in network jack, instead requiring the user to buy a Nintendo USB dongle to connect the thing to your network ""the old fashion way"".

Nintendo also released a while back it's Wii ware channel. This is sort of Nintendo's response to Xbox Live arcade or Xbox live community games. It's a great feature that lets smaller developers get there games out to a much larger audience. The problem is that the Wii only has 256 megs of built in memory to store those games on, and no hard drive support is promised. Things get tight quickly.

On the audio visual side this console is a joke. For a full 50 bucks less you can buy a machine that does HD graphics and supports proper surround sound. Dolby Digital 5.1 has been around for a long, long time now, and to not even include an optical port on the Nintendo wii is vexing to say the least. If you care at all about how your games look or sound, avoid this platform. The graphics hardware it's self is essentially a game cube repackaged. If you get a chance, run the original Halo that came out as a launch game for the Xbox against any Wii game. Halo typically looks better, and it came out 6 years ago.

Next there is the online experience. As mentioned before, Nintendo was kind enough to provide wifi support on the console and with that connection they give you access to free online gaming. But rather than having a unified friends list like Xbox live or PSN, your required to trade 16-digit friend codes in order to friend someone, and those friends don't necessarily persist from game to game. This means swapping friend codes for every single game you play on the wii. Not my idea of fun. In addition to the online gaming, Nintendo also offers a news reader, weather channel, web surfing and some other fun extras. These features ultimately are fairly useless as most people who have a Wii connected via wifi also have a PC connected that can run it's screen at a higher resolution and thus make for a much more pleasant web surfing experience.

So what is good about this thing? Where the Wii proves to be at it's best is in exactly the same spots where Nintendo consoles have always been at there best - local multilayer gaming. 4-player split screen Mario kart will always be fun, and Wii sports shows that introducing motion controls allows simple sports movements to be replicated in a party atmosphere with some degree of accuracy (although, admittedly, not all that much accuracy either). If your the type of person who wants to have 4 people in front of the TV to game, then this console is a good buy. Just remember: 3 extra wii motes and nunchucks will run you approximately an extra 180 dollars (although you can save a bit buy buying online). At that price, you could have a blu-ray playing PS3.

Lastly, there is the software. This console has shown it's self to be just like every other Nintendo console ever made - First party Nintendo games sell great but everyone else not so much. The result has been smaller, lower funded development teams developing piles of shovel ware for the system. This console lacks any major AAA 3erd party games. Generally the only AAA games on this platform are Nintendo made, and even those are generally retreads of older Nintendo game such as Smash Bros and Mario Kart. We've played these games before, and they want us to spend 60 bucks to play them again.

To any a/v nut or anyone who loves AAA games out there, this console is an utter waste of your time and money. I couldn't recommend it less. But to anyone who just wants a simple, go have fun with your friends on the couch experience, it would be hard for me to recommend a better platform. It will be a smash hit at thanksgiving and Christmas get together, but when your board on a Wednesday night and alone, this consoles poor online and lack of AAA games will leave you board.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_232?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=232&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was skeptical that it would really be all THAT fun, but I was wrong.  Currently, I spend about equal amounts of time playing the Wii as I do my Xbox 360.  Sadly, my PS3 has been mostly used for Blu Ray movies.

The Wii is an entirely different gaming experience that the 360.  In fact, it's unlike anything I've ever experienced thus far.  For the most part, I play games like Gears of War, Crackdown, FEAR, etc. on my Xbox 360.  These are games that take full advantage of the processing power of the Xbox - this is the 1080i stuff that just looks amazing on my XBR2.  However, when I want to play something that's just plain fun. . . the Wii is fast and easy to use!

I know there are games like Madden '07 that are available on both systems, but the graphics aren't going to approach the same quality as that of the Xbox.  So, that begs the question, why buy the Wii version?  For the new type of game playing. . . motion detection in the Wii remote!  The WAY you play the games can actually be more important than the raw processing power of the unit itself!  Yeah!  Sounds crazy, but it's true!

Nintendo certainly hit one out of the park with the Wii!  There are some in-depth shooters for this system (Red Steel, COD3, Far Cry, etc.) and some more on the way (Metroid Prime 3 Corruption) as well as games that don't require as much involvement or commitment (Elebits, Smooth Moves, Ray Man, etc.).  Either way, the Wii is a LOT of fun and the controllers aren't an issue for extended gaming periods.

I think a lot of people expected to be able to walk into stores and just pick up a Wii a few weeks after launch.  The irony is that I've seen PS3s just collecting dust on shelves in Best Buy and Wal-Mart, while I've yet to see a Wii on the store shelves!  Obviously Wii would like to play!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_197?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=197&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Some new features besides motion control have been added though, and now you can: view photos off SD cards, create weird little people that kind of look like you called Miis, and (given you have a wi-fi connection or adapter) download Nintendo's entire back catalog of games, vote on stuff, view the weather, read the news, and surf the internet with it (including youtube, myspace, and flash game sites).

On the games side, the Wii is pretty boring if you don't have any friends or family to play with, mainly because there are just two good single-player games that have come out: Zelda and Super Paper Mario. Soon that will change though as Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, Super Mario Galaxy, Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, and Soul Calibur Legends arrive on store shelves. Overall it's a good system but one that only excels above the others in price and controller innovation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_216?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=216&reviewerType=all_reviews"

System was sold as hacked","March 7, 2018","I don't usually write reviews unless really happy or really disappointed in a purchase/product, but I feel this one necessary to write to share my disappointment and frustrations. My son was having difficulties getting this system to do updates so he could sync the system to the internet from the moment he took it out of the box. It was not allowing him to do so and consistently sending ""code error"". We ""chatted"" with Nintendo for a good 45 minutes (they were very nice) and they had us do Speed tests on our internet and asked us to try many things to troubleshoot. The best they could come up with the FIRST time we called Nintendo was to call our internet service provider and check from them to see if our speed was ok and if that was the problem. We did and they said there was no problem from their end. A couple days later WHEN I FOUND YET MORE ""FREE"" TIME my son and I called Nintendo and this time it was about 25 minute call. This person had us do a few things and BINGO... The system was ""Home brew hacked"". Not knowing anything about this, and knowing my son wanted to play a few games and this hacking prevented him to do so, the man I spoke with said the system was compromised.  In all, I believe we WASTED over two hours of time to find out we were sold a system that was NOT stripped or refurbished to factory settings. Now, I have to take the time to pack it up, print label, bring to UPS. Do yourself a favor and ask if it TRULY is being sold as reset to the factory settings. I kicked myself for not going to GameStop to look for a pre-owned system, because they had plenty and I paid $79.99 and can go locally to get any help if needed. They assured me the system was re-set and that they'd never sell any system compromised such as this one was. I'm just so frustrated they would sell this. Would have been nice to use all the WASTED time playing a game on the wii with my son, not troubleshooting from the minute it came out of the box.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I got the Wii for Christmas and haven't stopped playing. The Wii is the best video game system I've ever played and I've played them all. I was with my in-laws for Christmas when I got the Wii. I opened it and figured I'd take it upstairs and set it up because they wouldn't be interested. Boy was I wrong. They all told me to hook it up downstairs, so I did. We spent the next few hours taking turns playing Wii sports against each other. Even people who had never played video games in there life played the Wii, including parents that are almost 70. The Wii did exactly what it was made to do. It brought the whole family together and got people to play video games that had never played before. Nintendo would be proud.

The gameplay is amazing and extremely fun. It presents a whole new way of playing video games. The motion sensing is almost flawless once you get use to it. It even gives you a little exercise. My right arm is sore from all the wii sports I was playing. The graphics are great, much better than the gamecube and these are only first generation games. Things will only get better once more software developers create more and better ways to use the wii-mote.

Overall, I would say the Nintendo Wii is a MUST BUY for everyone. It provides hours of entertainment and has something for everyone. Gameplay is awesome 5 stars, and the graphics are great 5 stars. (of course not as good as Xbox360 or PS3, but graphics can only get so good then you have to create better gameplay, the graphics are good enough, Zelda looks awesome)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_208?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=208&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The system is intuitively designed and, if you enjoy the motion sensing novelty, can be extremely enjoyable. However, one of my biggest reservations about buying the Wii in the first place was that it lacked a range of RPG titles, leaving me with games like Mario Kart and Super Smash Bros that are fun, to be sure, but provide me with many less hours of entertainment than my PS2 did.

Albeit the Accessories you need or want to purchase on top of buying the system and expensive games are costly, and there is a lack of decent games for the Wii as it is. If you are looking for a system that would be fun to play with friends and family then I highly recommend the Wii. Easy to play games make it fun for all ages, but you will need to purchase expense wiimotes and nunchucks in order to have up to four players in a game. Its an addition $40 for each wiimote and another $20 for each nunchuck. Not to mention if you want to buy a charging station with rechargeable battery packs for your wiimotes (theres another $40 or so) and then there are the games you would buy for it and possibly the cost of Wii points to download games to your system. You might also need a memory card for the Wii if you intend to save a lot of data. All in all, its a good system but you have to know what you want it for. I personally bought it to play new versions of the Nintendo brand games I know and love. Also it does make a good game night with friends, so that is an added benefit.

The point: If you are willing to invest $250 just to buy the system, be prepared to spend another $250 or more on equipment and games, 3 more wiimotes and nunchucks alone with set you back another $180.

The future: I look forward to the day when gaming systems with become generic like televisions, and you only need to worry about which brand to  buy because they all play the same games. Its a bright future, lets hope we get to that point. Then perhaps focus can be drawn to the games themselves and quality of gaming experiences will increase 10 fold.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_36?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=36&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Amick","Wii Well Worth the Price!","November 2, 2009","We had been waiting to purchase a Wii for some time and so when the prices dropped and Amazon offered free shipping and a $25 gift card toward the purchase of another Wii product, we had to order!  We absolutely love it!  However, I am still awaiting arrival of that $25 gift card!  Hopefully it will arrive soon.  We plan to purchase the Wii Fit Plus with it.  Cannot wait!  You really do get a work out with this unit just playing the simple games that come with it so we really want the Wii Fit to get in shape and lose weight over the winter months.  Plus, it's just plain fun!  The whole family can use this product it's so simple!  I highly recommend one to everyone!

I just want to add to the review of yesterday that, while we love are Wii and have no complaints about it, I do have a problem with Amazon and the way they do business!  When I purchased the Wii I was of the understanding, by their description, I would receive a $25 gift card as described above.  It sounded as though it was an automatic receipt, no instructions were included how to obtain it.  After waiting over 2 weeks I contacted them to find that apparently I must enter a promo code, which I did not have, and set it as a ""purchase"" in order to obtain the gift card!  Well Amazon can keep their gift card, I want my Wii Fit now!  That being said, I will simply go to Wal Mart and purchase it since I was going to have to purchase it with a credit card anyway!  Way to go Amazon!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Hawkins","Just plain fun","December 21, 2006","In the few weeks since I finally got my hands on Wii the thing that has surprised my most has been how much I've just enjoyed playing fun, simple games like Wii sports.  I've played first person shooters for years, and have loved them.  Over the years though I've discovered they are a lot like action movies though, same plot, often enjoyable, but fairly repetitive and predictable.  I bought a Wii in hopes of experiencing different types of games.  And so far I have been pleasantly surprised.  I never thought I'd want to play tennis every day, but it's a great little 20 minute break from work to get me re-energized and get me out of my chair (the joys and perils of the home office).  Ultimately I think this system has great potential and I hope the game designers take advantage of the new possibilities.  It's been exactly what I was looking for in a game system, fun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_232?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=232&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I LOVE this gaming system, because it IS fun, and it IS a good workout. All the games are interactive, and thats what makes me so into the Wii. I have owned the nintendo, the sega genesis, playstation, PS2, x box and gameboys(regular, color, DS, etc...) AND the Wii is the only one that i still play. sitting in front of a TV is boring to me, and it makes me not want to play video games. the only other system that remotely compares to the Wii is my DS, but still i give the Wii 5 stars. its really is good clean fun, and a great way to get fit while you play. i can spend 3 hours playing a workout game, and not even realize how long i was playing for. then wake up the next day with my arms sore (so i KNOW im getting good exercise which is great). i would recommend this to anyone of any age from young children to teens to adults :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_189?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=189&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Played great for Sports Plus but after buying Zelda SS I noticed lots of mis-placed pixels. I googled the prob and everything said fried GPU (Graphics Card). I informed the seller who promptly offered a refund so long as I paid for it to be shipped back. I don't feel I should have been responsible for shipping considering I ordered a LIKE NEW item, but the seller would not bend. I did pay because losing out on $12.00 is better than being stuck with a broken Wii. My return shipment took two days to arrive compared to the two weeks I waited for arrival.

First, I was a bit hesitant because I kept expecting another ""Gameboy Advance - Now with brighter screen!"" fiasco. Uh huh. Spend the money on a Wii and they come out with a new one several months later. Or a smaller version - the WiiLite perhaps? So I stayed on that fence for quite a while and waved my hand at any encouragement to go out and buy one.

Then one day I was at a friend's house and he asked if I'd liked to play a game of bowling on his new Wii. I said sure, what the heck. It was free. So he started it up and handed me a Wiimote. That was all it took. After a day's worth of gaming on the Wii I was hooked. I was immediately impressed with the fluid responsiveness of the remote - picking up even the slightest wrist movement could turn your throw into a wicked curve or a straight on dead shot. Another thing that amazed me is that after playing a days worth of bowling and golf I was sore for a week.

The following week my brother came by to visit and I mentioned I had played the Wii and he shocked me by saying he had played it too and loved the bowling game. This was news to me since I knew my brother did not care for video games. Since he was hanging out for the evening I decided to take the plunge and we went to our local Gamestop and I picked up the Wii and an extra controller. We went home and I hooked the console up and we spent the evening bowling. It was the most fun we'd had together since camping as kids.

This is the main reason I love the Wii, because Nintendo has done exactly what they set out to do - they have created a gaming console that gets you up, gets you involved, and gets people together. They should have stuck with their original name, because in this regard the Wii is definitely a revolution.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_176?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=176&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Xbox 360 sucks after a while because the only game i hear about is Gears of War *Notice Gears of War is just another Halo* and no one else is online when i play my other games 75% of my friends are playing Gears of War. PS3 sucks because everyone who brought it is either a Kingdom Hearts Fan or Final Fantasy Fan or just want Assis. Creed which by the looks of what i've seen is just another Prince Of Persia with better graphics. Zelda isn't the greatest game since they said over 50 hours or game play and i beat it in less then 15 hours.

after the 1st two nights of playing the baseball game that comes with it my muscles were sore and it felt as if i had been working out for a week. this is not to say a lot of the games are a workout you can sit down for quite a few, somewhat defeating the purpose behind the system. the ability to buy the wii points through the system is a great idea ensuring you dont have to run to the store if you want to get a classic game.
for the most part a lot of classic games are on the and they keep adding new ones everyday. ive downloaded supermario bros3 and it only took about 5 minutes to download and it works perfectly, you can even use the start-select trick.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_229?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=229&reviewerType=all_reviews"

And I do mean EVERYONE! Whether you're an advanced gamer, a novice gamer, a mother, a father, a grandparent, kids, whoever! Doesnt matter if you have been playing for years or never have played in your entire life. YOU WILL WANT TO PLAY THIS!

My wife has been playing the new Zelda & Wii Sports games for like 4 days straight! And she NEVER used to play games. She loves the motion sensing controls of the system & says its easier to learn because it feels more natural than just mashing a bunch of buttons on some huge brick of a controller like the other guys (Sony & MS) have. And its totally affordable too, so its a GREAT deal for what all you get with the system. The graphics aren't quite as good as the PS3 or Xbox 360, but they are still great & will still knock your socks off. Be sure to get the component cables for even better looking graphics too!

Mark this on your calendars folks. Its the time in history when Nintendo took gaming to the next level. Bravo!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_244?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=244&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have boxed with with mother-in-law, played tennis with my dad and went bowling with my friends. And while I wouldn't recommend this for a strenous aerobic workout, it certainly gets you and and moving. There was a little bit of a learning curve only because the controllers are unlike any other game controllers from consoles past. In reality, both my parents and in-laws (who are far removed from the gaming ""culture"") picked it up very quickly and had an enjoyable time.

As new games come on the market, the wide-range of capabilities because more realized as seen in the myriad of ""poses"" in Wario Ware: Smooth Moves. Using the contollers for games such as The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess bring an entirely new dimension to adventure games.

Overall, the Wii is an incredibly innovative and fun.

More importantly, if you are thinking about buying one, the most promising aspect of this system is the potential for group gaming. The controllers, like Nintendo advertised, offers a lot of fun for gamers and people who have never touched a video game before--this aspect beats out the other two, more powerful systems. For the most part the controllers are strong.

Now sure there are games out there that are worth playing by yourself such as Zelda, but I think the biggest grab this system has is the ability to make gaming fun for everyone.

This system has the promise of being the number 2 system because of its price and its ability to be played by almost anyone.

The one lacking point is the graphics. Sure, this may only be a minor aspect for some gamers but I argue the shelf life on this system may only run for about 6 years, while other systems such as Playstation 3 have a lot more time due to people lacking the current top of the line technology that the other systems offer, ex. blue-ray HDTV etc.

Recommended as a system for group gaming, fans of Nintendo games, and for serious gamers as a second system.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_262?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=262&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We bought this because the seller was well-rated and a new WII was not in our budget. We probably should have just bit the bullet and bought it new with a warranty. First, the system came set in Spanish. This we found quite amusing, and with minimal detective work, we had the language set to English. No big deal. Life went on fine, until last week, when the WII suddenly stopped reading discs properly. It completely freezes with an error reading, and has to be unplugged to even get it to return to the main screen. We have tried cleaning the discs, and attempted to use several different games, all to the same end...a black error screen. Now I realize it is a refurb, but any system that has been professionally repaired and cleaned should last longer than that.

I brought it home and became bored pretty fast. This is what everybody is after? If it wasn't so cheap, it wouldn't be nearly as popular as it is. The Wii remote isn't as advanced as you see on the TV. I was hoping that the motion sensors would actually copy the player's movements, but it doesn't. It just knows when you move and does it's own thing. Not to mention, the graphics aren't as good as the PS3 or 360 and the Wii doesn't release nearly half the games the other two do.

Overall, this is great for families looking for fun with the kids or a cheap system to buy if they can find it. If, however, you are a serious gamer, then this will only be impressive for the first few days. Afterwards, it definitely just isn't that fun. The best game is Super Smash Brothers Brawl and you don't even use the motion sensor in that game.

While it is not the strongest system out there, it definetly is a lot of fun. Family and Friends who normally have no interest in gaming at all will pick up and play games with us for a bit on this system. NEVER happened with any other system.

We have also started picking up some of the workout games and I really enjoy that. Who need to watch tv while you work out when you can just interact with a work out game.

We had an original model that ended up being defective after about 7 months (all of the games started freezing up), the process to ship to Nintendo and get a new one was quick and painless.

The recent price cuts and deals make this system even more valuable. Yes, it does not have all of the top of the line graphics and some games, but you do not need that for every system you own. We are PC gamers who supplement with goofy fun on our wii. With games like Wii Sports, Zelda, Mario Party 8, EA Active and more, kids,  parents and even grandparents can find these games fun!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_195?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=195&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The whole family ended up playing it and we all loved it. My husband and I loved it so much, that our parents, and us included, all pitched in to buy one for our Anniversary. We have been playing it all weekend. The great thing about the Wii is that it is family oriented. Nintendo doesnt put out games that are violent in nature and laced with sex and profanity. Which is great because not all people are interested in games like that. I think the Wii has an excellent variety of games for any age group to enjoy. I love the accessories, and the fact that it comes with a game when you buy it. I have and XBOX360 and I like playing my high end games, like Madden and such on it. But I like the different games the Wii offers that the other consoles dont. This is a great unit, and so much addictive fun for ANYONE who owns one.

I can totally understand the high demand craze for this system. Granted, the graphics are not as good as the XBOX360 or the PS3, but what Nintendo has done is brought gaming back as it should be. No high dollar price to get extras like dvd playing, music, internet, etc. They focused on making this a GAME console. If you want a DVD option, get a DVD player. If you want music, buy an Ipod or a stereo. If you want the internet, buy a computer. Consoles are supposed to be for GAMES. These other high end units have taken that away, although they are great, they are overpriced because of these features.

I say Kudos for Nintendo for making such a fun system, and I am glad to see what a success that it is, and why it continues to be in high demand and sells out. People can appreciate getting a system for the WHOLE famly, and investing in an affordable GAMING console without all of the extra mumbo jumbo at a high priced cost that the competitors offer on their units.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_183?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=183&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The controller--it's weird at first but honestly, I can't stand all of those freaking buttons on the other consoles' controllers. You'll get used to it quickly enough-and it's fun to fling that thing around.

Can cheaply download old Nintendo/Sega games...

This is the third line I've stood in since launch and it was so worth it. If you have young kids (mine are 7 and 8) this is the system for you. We've been enjoying playing the Wii Sports all morning and my kids picked up on how to use the Wiimote pretty fast. I heard stories of people dropping/throwing the Wiimote on accident but so far we have had no problems. I think my kids favorite is Rayman Raving Rabbids and mine is either Zelda or Avatar. If you can't get a Wii right away and want one...just wait it out for restocking at stores. Don't buy the auctions, etc. with the high prices.

I am a puzzle game person.  I love Tetris.  I loved Dr. Mario.  I like Super Mario Bros.  I like games that require strategy, timing and reflexes.

I am also a quitter.  I was left behind when games went to moving the camera, aiming, AND sneaking/running/walking...whew!  I was in the dust.  I want to be challenged; not frustrated.  I want to have fun; I am not romanced by dark shoot-'em up games.  There is also so much to be said for the difference in playing TOGETHER from watching someone else sneak/run/walk/aim/and look for an hour.

The controls are incredibly intuitive.  I didn't get frustrated.  The sports games are soo much fun.  And cute...I like cute too.  (Highly recommend Rayman also.)

This is so much more satisfying than what has been left for players like me...Bejeweled...Mahjong.  I was laughing out loud, for hours.  I LOVE IT.

In recent times I've asked myself, ""What ever happened to great videogame consoles like the Sega Saturn and the SNK Neo-Geo?"" The last great system in my opinion was the Sega Dreamcast, which I thought was the best system of the last generation. While the PS2 and GameCube had both good libraries (the XBox was the most overrated console in the universe), they didn't strike a chord with me like the machines of yesteryear.

Nintendo understands what direction to take. They know that the future of gaming is about innovative entertainment, NOT processing power. After all, how much more upgrading in hardware specs can we stomach until we finally realize we've been playing the same kind of games for years? Everything about the Wii is NO JOKE. It's fresh and innovative. It's small. It's light. It's well-priced. It comes bundled with a game. It's accessible to all ages. It's about the fun, the interactivity, and the replay value.

At first, I thought everything about the Wii was all gimmick. I was wrong. Wii Sports, while not the most impressive graphically, has tremendous replay value (especially with the Mii feature). No longer will playing Nintendo, or games in general, be called a lazy couch potato hobby. The Remote, Nunchuk, and overall motion sensor capabilities more than impressed me. I can't imagine Sony even trying to market such hardware with their shoddy parts. As for other games? For starters, it's backwards compatible with GC games and has the Virtual Console to play classics. It has many exclusives that utilize the controller in unique ways such as Raving Rabbids, Twilight Princess, WarioWare, and Red Steel. Players have other games to look forward to such as Super Mario Galaxy, Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition, and Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

Nintendo struggled in the late 90's, but has slowly came back with the GC, GBA, DS, and now the Wii. I am downright convinced Nintendo now and will always stay true to real gaming, and am glad they are still around since SNK and Sega have backed out from the console wars years ago. I don't even care if the Wii doesn't win this generation's console wars (though it deserves it). Nintendo still created the best console of them all which I'd find myself still playing with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_205?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=205&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I finally gave in and purchased both and I love them! I have now become a Wii junkie am always looking for new games and fun stuff to go with my Wii.

On the surface, it seems like a pricey game, however, it is worth every penny and more.  I have not ever been a ""gamer"" so I didn't see the point and I also wouldn't know the difference between the Wii and Xbox or any other game system.  I just know that it gets us off our butts and playing something really fun as a family or alone.

It also has wireless internet capability.  If you have wireless internet, you can do a lot with that including downloading more games at reasonable cost.

I highly recommend the Wii along with Wii Fit.  You won't regret it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_202?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=202&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Don't overlook Internet and Camera features.","July 2, 2007","Wii is an absolutely awesome video game system. Kids and parents alike love it.  The kinematic ""controllers"" let us stand up and excercise while we play. The machine is so small that it can stand up vertically beside the TV even in a cramped cabinet.

I recommend purchasing it with along with the Wii Play bundle that includes a game and an extra controller. That way you end up with two great family game disks and two much-needed controllers.

If you have Wi-Fi internet in your home, don't forget to set up your Wii to connect to the internet.  It is easy! You can access News and Weather Channels for free. The Weather Channel is surprisingly like a game in which you can explore and even spin the globe. From the Wii Store, you can purchase compatible games designed for earlier Nintendo systems for good prices.  You can also download a free Opera based web browser.  The web browser isn't great, because the effective screen resolution is low. But, it is worth a try.

If you have SD cards for your digital camera, try putting the card into the Wii's SD slot and running the Photo Channel.  The Photo Channel design is very creative and fun for kids.  They can scribble on top of photos and videos and even make puzzles out of photos and videos.  The slide show feature is excellent because of the way photos automatically pan to background music.  Try it out!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you are interested in its wide capability of game then you should read this review. I have played a lot of games on all most every game system that existed but this one is a nice wireless game system that is allowing you to play a game just by a flick in the wrist. The wii controller can die out on you if it is left on or miss used so i would only recommend it to parents and children 8 and up. If you have a child who is youger than eight he should probable not be using it. The wii has a little light on the top of it that tells you if it is on or not if it is red then it is off but if it is green then it is on.

  Now i am going to talk about how hard it is to set the wii system up. If you are able to set a TV up or any game system up than you will be done just as fast as you would with any thing else. In fact i did not need any help setting it up in the first place ,but occasionally the movement sense will fall or get lost because of a horrible sticky pad. If you do have trouble seting it up then the Nintendo company can help. I really have nothing else to say about setting it up because there is not much to it.

now i am going to tell you about what comes in it. The box contains the wii system, a wii controller, a wii sensing board, a wii game that is ever wii sports or wii play. It also comes with a exstention cord.

This was a Great system and i hope my preview helped you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_203?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=203&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Peek","Great System","January 4, 2008","My wife wanted to get our daughter a Wii for a gift.  I was very resistant as she has several gaming systems and I couldn't really see the point.

I lost and we got it.  As reluctant as I was to get this system, I must admit that it is great.  The games are very interactive and require quite a bit of movement.  It is much better than the typical 'couch potato' interaction of most video games.  That is not to say that playing Wii sports should be confused with exercise.  It is not that, but at least players must be somewhat active.  That is a big plus in and of itself.

In addition to the activity level required in some of the games, it is very fun for all ages.  I have only played the Wii sports games so far myself, but those are a lot of fun.  The games that come with the system include boxing, tennis, bowling, baseball, and golf.  I have played four of those so far and they are all quite fun.

I have noticed that the prices have gotten a bit crazy on these systems this season.  Although it is a lot of fun, I don't think it is worth some of the extreme prices that it is being sold for currently.  I would recommend watching and waiting for it at the normal prices, which is about $250.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_182?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=182&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Yes the gamecube had some quality titles, but were the handful enough to justify owning the system? Not for me. When the Wii came out I was VERY skeptical and had a feeling I'd end of passing it up. Well after some more consideration I thought it might be something fun for me and my wife to play (before I sound too old here, note I'm in my 20's). After weeks of searching hard to track down the Wii I finally managed to buy one.

The system started out fun, I enjoyed playing Mario Galaxy, Smash Bros, etc. Basically the system had those typical quality first part Nintendo titles. Flash forward and Mario Kart was released and was definitely interesting to play, though personally I preferred the control precision offered with an analog stick and not the wheel. After about 6 months more of the system sitting around collecting dust I kept searching and searching for quality Wii games...they were no where to be found. Yes the system has some great titles, but once again just a small handful like the gamecube did. It seems 96% of what's released on the system are poorly thrown together mini games that score 4.0-6.0 ratings and just flat out suck. I can't tell you how many times I stopped to look at the Wii games in Electronics only to be disappointed time after time with what's available. Overall Nintendo is *STILL* lacking quality third party titles.

Graphics completely aside, all this time while the Wii was sitting I was getting tons of use out of the PS3 with many great titles. To me the Wii isn't quite the bargain everyone makes it out to be. Just because the initial system purchase seems small does *NOT* mean the overall cost of ownership is. I spent just as much money on the Wii as I did my PS3 once you factor in grabbing a couple controllers / other shells needed for games. That is the whole point of the system right...to play with other people and have fun? Nintendo makes a KILLING on remotes for this thing. Sure..$199 for the system with the price drop, plus $40 for another WiiMote + 20 dollars for another Nunchuck...oh but wait now there's ""Wii motion plus"" ok another 20 dollars for each controller you own. These costs add up very fast.

Nintendo also seems to enjoy crippling their own services. So they offer all those games via the Wii Shopping channel, the games that you can only put on a 512mb internal storage or 2gb SD card...are you kidding? In the day in age where you can get 8gb flash drives for $29, 4gb microsd cards the size of your pinky for $13...I think Nintendo could of offered a better means of giving us storage for the games. Personally to me, the Wii is NOT worth the $250 it was launched for and still isn't worth the $199 it's now selling for. When you look at what the console is capable of doing in comparison to it's competition it's nowhere even close and I don't mean just graphically. Both the 360 and the PS3 offer tremendously more features. Yes the Wii has the motion sensing controller but it seems very few developers make good use of it and even the games that do make interesting use of it..you still lose precision more often than not over a standard (and much more comfortable to hold for long gaming sessions) controller.

It also really annoys me that other than the games running at a max of 480p resolution, Nintendo offers no means of improving what old titles look like. Both the 360 and PS3 offer smoothing effects and also use anti aliasing to clean up the older titles and make them a lot clearer / more vivid. It amazes me that even the most poorly written emulators on the PC (sorry not illegal when I own the old systems / games) offer screen smoothing, anti aliasing, etc to make the games look SO much better, yet Nintendo doesn't do this!

I realize hardware isn't everything, but it is nice to feel immersed in a game with gorgeous graphics and detailed sound. Yes the Wii is selling good, it seems quite popular among families, that's great. For myself, I sold it and recently bought the Holiday Bundle Xbox 360 elite. It's already got more playtime than my Wii had in a year of owning it...sorry Nintendo but this was my last let down system from you!","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_261?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=261&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have not owned console in years and finally found a great deal right on this site.  If you do your reseach you will know that the Nintendo Wii is not the most powerful console but it is the top seller beating out the X-Box 360 and Playstaion 3 for a reason.  It's FUN!!!  The free disc the comes with the system lets you play various sporting games and gets you used to a new way of playing games. You dont have to worry about hitting ten different buttons while playing games like other systems.  If possible, you have to connect your Wii to the internet wirelessly.  I enjoy the PC but having access to all of my sites right before or after games is a blast.  Do yourself a favor and buy this system.  Have some fun...it's worth the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

For the price ($150 last year just before Christmas) it's a pretty great gaming system. I like that it does so much. I've always loved nintendo and in fact haven't owned any other system, so I can't compare it to xbox or ps3 or anything. It's great to be able to download games from online, and I can play my old gamecube games on it too. It's also nice to watch netflix vids on the wii. I will say that I'm not a big fan of the games where you just sit there and shake the remote or something, I prefer the games where you really move. I think the wii is great for what it is and worth the price. For instance the Wii Sports game rocks! I love the games and you really get into it, so much so that after playing for hours yesterday my arms are killing me. I'm a big fan of boxing, which is really fun to play. I have heard about xbox's new game with Kinect where, basically like the wii but without remotes, and it sounds fun. I'm hoping that eventually they develop something like that for the wii, but buying an xbox and kinect for $400 is way too much. Anyway, if you're a nintendo fan you'll probably like the wii, if you aren't, you may like it you may not. It's definitely great for families and such. My grandma even plays wii bowling at her senior center.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_179?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=179&reviewerType=all_reviews"

  The console itself is downright tiny--easily the smallest and lightest of the new generation of game machines. At 1.75 inches high by 6.25 inches wide by 8.5 inches deep (when oriented horizontally). But with different kinds of wii games, you can do what you want to do.
  It is a season for giving gifts. Thanks to the EBay 30% cash back through Live.com for BIN items.
  I bought two wiis from Ebay and get $192 cash back from live.com, the final price is much cheaper than AMAZON.
  For those unfamiliar, you basically go to Live.com and do a search for an item like ipod, wii, etc. It will take you to a page with a 30% off link for EBay for the item. Once you click that, it will redirect you to EBay and show a 30% icon at the top of the EBay page which will apply to any BIN item on EBay (not just the item you searched for). You also can find a full instructions from the item page I bought.

The Nintendo Wii is the only console I have ever seen that really and truly appeals to absolutely everyone I know in one way or another.

To give you a basic idea of the complete range of this system, the following people have played and enjoyed our Wii:
27 year old female (me), 28 year old male (hubby), 4 year old male (son), 22 year old male (brother, ended up buying himself one), 25 year old male (other brother), 52 year old female (mom), 58 year old male (dad), 25 year old female (sister in law), 26 year old female (friend), 31 year old male (friend), 27 year old female (friend), 30 year old male (friend), 15 year old female (cousin), 15 year old male (cousin, also got one for himself), 12 year old female (cousin), and many many many more.

Games like Super Mario Galaxy, Metroid Prime, and Mario Kart keep my video game fanatic of a husband intrigued and challenged. Wii Sports has had everyone I know at least TRY (and thoroughly enjoy) the system which does not happen. This is the first time I have ever seen my mother play any type of video game and we have had video games in our house for decades. I love games like Mario Party and My Sims and am currently really getting a kick out of my Wii Fit as well. My four year old son adores the Wii Sports and the Mario Kart. My almost 2 year old daughter doesn't really care what's going on as long as she's holding on to a WiiMote.

This is definitely fun for the entire family. This is entertainment at its best-- people getting together and having a great time OR enjoying some time to yourself to unwind.

This is NOT progression in video gaming technology as far as competing with the XBox 360 or PS3. I think it's completely ridiculous to try and compare these systems. I can understand debating between an X Box or a PS 3 but the Wii is completely separate. This is not about amazing graphics and smooth controls, compelling story lines, and innovative plot development. This is a completely new way to play and should be seen that way.

I don't believe it's too kiddy for anyone. There are plenty of titles out there to appeal to all types of players and more are coming. This is by far the most rewarding video game purchase we have made and I have no qualms of continuing investing into it with each new title (Mario Kart with a wheel!) or feature (have I mentioned how much I adore the new Wii Fit?).

Thank you so much Nintendo. Keep it coming!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_177?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=177&reviewerType=all_reviews"

While I would recommend the 360 as your primary home gaming console, this thing is definately worth buying for the party games alone!

I got mine in on thursday, and only had wii sports at the time.  A bunch of friends were meeting at my place before we headed down to a wedding.  I fired this thing up, and we played bowling untill 3am!  Only reason we went to bed was cause we were going to be up all weekend.  Everybody had fun, game enthusiest and non.  Although you don't have to, we were actually going through the complete bowling motions, steps and all, and it felt right!  Trash talking ensued, and a good time was had by all.

There is everything for a family to enjoy together. While other games makes the players just sit down and play, Wii's interactive feature allows you to be part of the game and move, run with it. So children won't end-up being couch potatoes. The console features are so simple that everyone can figure out very easily. Once you get the feel of it you'll never leave the game. The only weakness I found is graphics. Perhaps this is good in a way that players can focus more on playing the game than viewing it. Overall, it's a worthwile investment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_220?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=220&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So I am not going to mention how fun it is.

Instead, I would like to point out the pros and cons of Wii at the current 2.0U firmware. Things may change for future firmware updates.

The reason I give 3 Stars is because I average two major categories: Innovation and Technology.  I give Innovation for 5 stars, and technological achievement and convenience for 2 stars.

Motion Sensing technology is nothing new, it has been applied to cell phone gaming and vehicle air bags for quite a while.  The system is barely an upgrade from the Gamecube.  It is extremely inconvenient to share game save data compare to PS3 and even Gamecube.  The innovation point is how Nintendo has achieved to redesign the motion sensors for even better game play experience.

Pros:

- Parental Control

- Able to count amount of time user has spent to play different Wii channels. Best for parents tracking kids video game time.

- Motion Sensing Controller is extremely similar as Playstatoin 3's Six-Axis Controller.  This brings brand new intuitive gaming experience.

- Bluetooth wireless technology in Wii Remote prevents cord wind up hazzles and less wireless signal interference.

- AC Adaptor is separated from the console. This makes it the smallest Next Generation Console on the Market at this moment.

- Backward Compatibility to Gamecube and Virtual Consoles.

- White color in a very clean design.

- Built in WiFi for internet downloads.

- New Internet Browser is available for download in April 2007

- Cheapest amaong XBOX360 and PS3

- Suitable for all ages as long as you can hold the remote and know how to swing it.

- My 90 Year Old Grandpa was able to get a strike in bowling, hole in one in Golf, some tennis racket swing and boxing punches.

Cons:

- Games are not Region Free. Unlike Playstation3 and PSP, that are region free, user cannot play import games at all without modifying their Wii's hardware.  American gamers are going to miss out a lot of interesting Japanese games such as Gundam, Naruto, Super Robot War, and many many others, even those games that don't really require people to understand Japanese!

- Unable to count the amount of time the user playing Gamecube games.

- Cannot easily exchange the game save data from one Wii to another. Let me elaborate this problem.

  If you want to share your Zelda progress to another friend, you cannot simply store your game save in the SD card and bring to your friend's house to load in his Wii console.  Instead, you have to do the following

  1. overwrite his save file. Make sure you tell your friend to backup his own save data. Or,

  2. if he hasn't played the game yet, you have to create a save file by playing the game and save at the first save point.  After that, you have to overwrite the the save on the console with the one in the SD card.

- You must need a gamecube memory card and controller to play Gamecube games.  You cannot backup or save any data on the Wii console's internal 512MB memory nor SD card.  If you want to know how ripoff Nintendo is on Gamecube memory cards, please read my other reviews on ""Gamecube memory card 1019 and 59 Blocks"".

- The system resets itself even from minor configuration.

- Cannot use the Wii Remote to call up the system menu when playing Gamecube.  Therefore, you cannot even turn off the system with the remote.

- Lacking DVD movie support even Wii game disc has the memory and physical size of a DVD.

- The system gets warm during standby mode. Not sure the power consumption during Standby mode.  Anybody can clearify this?

- It does not have an option for automatic firmware update in standby mode.

- Somtetimes takes nearly 30 minutes or more to receive messages or Mii from other players.

- Virtual Console Account is depended on the system's serial number instead of an online account.  That means if you have purchased any games/software from Wii Shop and suddenly your Wii is malfunctioning, either for an exchange or brand new replacement, you CANNOT redownload the contents for free in any replacement system.  You might need to contact Nintendo regarding to giving you back the Wii Points for in-store exchange/manufacture warrenty to redownload the content to the replacement system.

- It creates a noise from the disc reader trying to read the disc even the slot is empty everytime the user resets or turn on the sytem.

- Currently, most games are party games, it is fun when you have a buch of friends sitting side by side to each other.  There is currently no online games available.

- The GPU and CPU is a lot inferior compare to XBOX360 and PS3; therefore, the graphics and controls are really bad especially for any kind of First Person Shooters. We'll see how well Metroid Prime perform in Wii soon.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_237?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=237&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you want to buy online, I recommend you to use a debit card with just the right ammount of money charged, that is, the price of the object you are going to buy, the shipping charge, the tax charges (if it is neccesary) and a little extra money, just in case. Even when amazon is a very secure site for buying,taking some extra measures to avoid internet phising or any other ciber problems its indeed a good thing to do.

It will work for a 2nd game box but I'm not happy with it being in black and white instead of color. I was told the reason for the problem was it had probably got too hot at one time.

We like it because it gets our kids up and moving.  We have long winters where we live, so being able to get the kids active is hard at times.
Oh, yea, FYI!  When you buy the game system, plan on spending a whole lot more money for all the extras.  We bought 3 extra sets of the remote and nanchuki-thing (about $80 per set), Mario Kart along with four steering wheels, Mario party is a must, the entire Rock Band set (love this, I play the drums while my 11 year old son rocks out on the guitar!).  You also need to splurge for the remote charger base in order to keep from replacing AA batteries. All in all, we ended up spending about $600 on the extra stuff. My next purchase will be the wii fit...at least when I can find it in stock somewhere.:)

Sure the other systems have downloadable content, but here, you have Nintendo's classics, so this system is a great ""museum"" in a sense of gaming history, as corny as that sounds.  You will need a classic controller or Gamecube controller for SNES/N64 games so keep that in mind.  So far I've never had a problem using the motion controls, they are very reliable.  I will say the included Wii Sports is a bit dated with the release of Wii Sports Resort.  Wii Sports was a fun game but to me, there isn't enough motion control since you don't really aim your golfswings and bowling balls at all with the wii mote, rather it only gages strength, speed, and timing, which is a bit of a let down since aiming your pitches, swings etc, would've been way more interactive and that's what I think about when I think of motion controls.  Wii Sports Resort, the new sequel for sale, seems to rectify this, but that's sold separately.

Just to cover up a few concerns and negative stereotypes of this system

1.  Graphics to me are fine.  They are like a cleaned up high budget Gamecube game at worst case scenario.  Best case scenario it looks like an EARLY Xbox 360 game but in standard def and some games just released or about to be released in 2010 are pushing the system to what it can really do (google images from the upcoming game Monster Hunter Tri to see some impressive graphics)

2.  The game library to me is just fine.  I heard many people complain there wasn't enough games or there were only childish/simple games available.  While that USED to be the case, 2009 filled out the Wii's library with mature titles suitable for more serious gamers, so there's literally something for everyone, just go on a gaming site and check out the whole library of games.  I was gaging on which console to get, and believe it or not, I found the Wii's library to be the best in terms of variety and later this year to 2010 looks like it will be a HUGE year with many AAA titles coming.  IMO by Xmas of 2010 the Wii will have the deepest library if things hold up.  Hopefully I don't sound like a fanboy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_188?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=188&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Everyone plays with that. Kids, Women, Old people, young people, people with fancy evening clothes! etc...

Price is good, and the potential is great. Zelda is awesome. Have you ever tried to play a game where you actually holding a sword???

Fishing, throwing etc..  become realistic. That's where the revolution relies. You can do more money from enhancement experience than eye candy. At the end, that's what we want. We would like to be _in_ the game. Holding something that is closed to the reality. Wii sports is amazing.

It worth standing in line and getting the vary last one!

EA and other will start using that potential. Every _family_ that visit my living room is going to buy one. That's a fact. ""I want one of these"" is a common phrase.

Nintendo will probably take the profit and build there next gen to rule that market. Good for them.

Adams","Had High Expectations; Was Still Blown Away","November 20, 2006","Ever since I heard that Nintendo's newest console was going to play old Nintendo games (NES, SNES, etc) I started listening. When I saw the controller the first time, I was hooked.  Console gamers have been using the same old same old controller for years, and it never seemed like it was going to end, but then Nintendo said ""No, we're going to do something really DIFFERENT.""

But although the Wii is different, and in a good way, it can appeal to diehard gamers the same way Nintendo wants to bring in new gamers.  My brother, who is a big Xbox/Halo fan, said that the controller was ""Dumb"" when I first showed him pictures of it, but when he actually got it in his hand, and started to see what it could so, I started hearing something different from him: ""This is so cool. This is the best system.""

Nintendo has a winner on its hand, even if it doesn't seem like it at first. The DS was plaged with people (including me) not getting it at first, but now, it's destroyed the PSP in the marketplace.  I think we'll see something similar happen with the Wii in the coming months.  Sony, get ready to lose your top seat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_206?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=206&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I ordered the Wii recently and it came in yesterday. After less than ten minutes of installation I put Wii Sports in and was immediately pleasantly surprised. I expected simple little games, with a little motion sensing finish, but I didn't expect them to be highly addictive and fun.

Wii Sports is like five games in one. For instance in Boxing you beat your first oponent and the next and they progressively become more difficult, challenging you a little bit more one after the other. I won't spoil anything else for you, but if your into fun, addictive, family games than the Nintendo Wii is for you. On the flipside, you've got the new games coming out, with a much darker finish.

In short, the Wii is a sure-thing to appeal to the hard-core gamer for its innovation, as well as the casual gamer who just wants to sit down every once and a while. (Like my mother, for instance. She never plays videogames, but there she was whacking those tennis-balls!)

Having the game pad (wii-mote) sense the intensity, direction and rotational speed and translate into game play while so obvious in hind-sight is nothing short of revolutionary.

My 6 year old son who I play this with, absolutely loves it - so much so - we use it as the carrot for getting his school homework done.

As for the technical details, this is one very well made electronic device on which significant thought has been put into ease of everyday use.  Be it the upright positioning or the wireless network or the hideaway SD card slot or the connection to the Sensor bar on the Tv which allows this unit to be hidden away from sight or the ability to power it on/off with the remote or the user interface - every single detail has been carefully thought out.

Here's an example of the thoroughness of the design - the wireless network allows you to place it in a place where it can be hidden and no messy wires to connect. Also, the wireless network supports either B or G networks and has WPA2 security built in.  Allows for connection to routers where the SSID broadcast is intentionally off.  Or, if you have a default wireless network, the Wii allows for a DHCP connection from a list of available networks.  Or if your router is AOSS enabled, it allows for connection using AOSS.

While still technically quite good, the strength of this console stems from the fact that it was designed to make playing games easy and nothing detracts from this.

We have a couple of other game consoles that we have at home and apart from the initial play those consoles have received, they are pretty much gathering dust, just because game play was not intuitive and tough to get a hang off.

I don't consider myself a gamer by any stretch and am very happy that I bought this - Both my son and I play regularly on this and have to force ourselves to stop.  The included Wii Sports is hours of fun.

This is definitely something that I don't have buyer's remorse on.  My wife who is not keen on any electronics has actually said more than once that she thought the enjoyment that the both of us got from the console was definitely worth the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_214?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=214&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have been playing the Wii since it came out, and it's still going strong.  But for the record, let me point out that you should read this review with the understanding that I am a huge Nintendo fan.  Also, I am a 22 year old Male who's been playing video games since the original NES.

The Wii is truly awesome.  The motion controls, from swinging the remote as a sword to using it as a steering wheel, make for some very exciting experiences.  Although some games don't use this feature very well (sloppy motion to on-screen translation), the ones that apply it properly are gems.  Some examples are Madworld, Mario Party 8, Zelda: Twilight Princess, Mario Kart, and Wii Play.

The pointer is a huge plus.  It reads extremely well on every game I have played that utilizes this feature.  Metroid Prime 3, Super Mario Galaxy, Zelda, Wii Play, and Red Steel are great examples of how good this can work.  Shooters, like Metroid Prime 3, are greatly augmented by being able to point and shoot with such accuracy.  It adds a realistic layer of skill to shooters that I find very immersing.

There are plenty of games that can use the Gamecube controller or Classic controller attachment instead for those that don't like the Wii controller--Guilty Gear XX Accent Core, Super Smash Brothers Brawl, etc.  Virtual Console downloads are awesome, as well as some of the Wii Ware games that have emerged.  Having the opportunity to download great games from the NES, SNES, NeoGeo, Sega, Turbo Grafx, etc. adds some serious value to the Wii, in my opinion.  Backwards compatibility with all GCN games is cool as well.

The Wii has frozen a few times in the middle of a game, but it's very rare.  The overall performance of the Wii is excellent.  It doesn't over heat, the electric power usage is (understandably) less than the other major systems, and its nice compact size is very appealing.

The problem that a lot of people have with this system is the ""lack"" of ""mature"" games.  I will admit that if you are into hard core shooters, the Wii is not the best system (although the Conduit might change that).  RPGs aren't very common either.  However, there are plenty of great games that older gamers can enjoy on the Wii.  For example, Zelda, Metroid Prime 3, Mad World, No More Heroes, Medal of Honor: Heroes, Super Mario Galaxy, Battalion Wars 2, Okami (a PS2 port with Motion Controls added), Resident Evil 4 (what many people consider to be the best version), Excite Truck, and others.  There are also many more coming out in the future.

To summarize my points, the Wii's controller features can be very effective when used properly.  The pointer is very efficient for shooters, the motion controls add plenty of depth, and there are some really great games for the system.  It's not going to be everybody's favorite, but it's definitely mine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_175?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=175&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pull","get one","November 20, 2009","It's great fun, but you have probably heard that already.  There are a ton of fun group games you can play with this thing: it's not a high definition gaming monster, but if you want to entertain your friends, there's no video gaming option like the Wii for finding games that they can just pick up a controller and play somewhat competently.

If you had any appreciation for Super Mario Bros, or SMB3, you'll need to pick up the New Super Mario Brothers Wii.  It's one of the most fun games you'll ever play with 2 or three others.

Cons:
* by the time you get done buying extra wiimotes and nunchucks and hd cables and batteries and balance boards and all that jazz, it's not too tough to have spent $400 or more.
* not high definition

Pros:
* great for parties
* fun controllers
* mario, zelda, and metroid
* ability to download and play ""old-school"" games
* just about everything else
* your old parents can play it and have fun
* your even older grandparents can play it and have fun

Capturing that feeling of gameplay, making it totally interactive, creative, something we've never seen before, we become part of the video game again. The system is smaller than i thought it would be - fits nicely in an entertainment system- very sleek. The controllers are so easy to use and after about 30 minutes you'll wonder how you ever played a game without them. The graphics are beautiful, smooth lines and rounded edges everywhere -no pixelated graphics here. The interface is simple to use, the instructions are self explanatory. If there were ever a system to wait 6 hours on line in Times Square in the cold, it was this one. The experience was not one I'll soon forget and owning the Wii is definitly something I won't regret. As for the price- it beats out the Xbox360 and PS3. It's affordable, innovative, fun for the whole family - kids will love the nunchuck controller and wii sports, swinging the controller around!!! I absolutely love Nintendo because they do a great job putting a high quality on the market that is affordable for everyone and innovative all at the same time.

I enjoyed it for the first couple of months and started to get bored with it. It was fun because I never played games in a manner of getting up and moving, but it got old, quick.

I haven't honestly turned it on in the past 6 months.

I grew up with SNES so I've grown accustomed to stagnant game playing (meaning I don't like moving around to play a game).

It's not a bad system, but it's not that great either. Maybe for kids and younger teenagers it is a good system, but I personally don't see any appeal in it.

If it weren't for the fact that the system belongs to both my brother and I, I would sell it so someone else could get enjoyment out of it.

There also aren't many games out for my tastes. Most games I see are directed towards kids, so I never see anything I would want to play.

So, to be straight forward, Wii is a good system for kids and younger teenagers (and even adults who don't normally play games), it just wasn't for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_251?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=251&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Shaughnessy","Wii love it!","January 7, 2009","My wife and I had some reservations about introducing a video game console to our kids (ages 7 & 8) because we've always been opposed to traditional video games where kids just vegetate on the couch in front of the TV and only exercise their thumbs.  Well, I'm sure anyone reading this review by now knows that the Wii is an entirely different kind of gaming platform, and ""Wii love it!""

The Wii Sports games that come with the console are all very fun, and will leave your muscles sore the next morning (that's a good sign!) The console comes with one Wii remote and one Wii nunchuck - you'll definitely want to buy a second Wii remote and second nunchuck (so you can play 2 player games.)  If you have plenty of room in front of your TV, you might want to have 4 Wii remotes so that 4 players could play tennis together, but 2 remotes have worked just fine for us so far.

The Wii console has Wifi capability, so you can connect it to the internet through your wireless router.  This enables a few other features such as: Wii Shop (you can buy and download other games directly off the internet), Weather (which has a very nice user interface) and News (again with a very nice UI for reading the latest news stories including viewing high quality photos that accompany some stories). The internet connection also enables the Nintendo channel which has videos of all the latest games as they are released, and a couple of other fun diversions (Check Mii Out channel and Wii Vote channel.)

Installation was very simple - we were up and running (literally) very quickly! Our whole family has enjoyed it, and now we have Wii nights with our neighbors (who also got a Wii for xmas).  If you haven't bought one yet, what are you waiting for?

One last thing... the Wii Fit (sold separately) is AWESOME!  That should be your very next purchase after the Wii console itself.  Check out those reviews too.

Small boxes

You ever have that feeling of complete bliss? We have those moments when your memories from the past have slipped within a secret compartment in your mind, a doorway that shows you a peaceful, wonderful place living inside your mind. This body creates sketches, pages, pictures, feelings, from our life and puts it all in a small little box, neatly stored away to see and flip thru like an old picture book. Well, if you have been in that state or in a convertible, driving along a highway and the wind in your hair, music swirls around you from the stereo and the road showing you no end in sight for it seems like the car has wings. It's great, isn't it? The way the music can take you and your past, blend them together like a beautiful sonnet and recite back to you the emotions of that time.

I am speaking of a small box, a wonder that can strangely, bring these feelings to the surface. You can sense them in your mind and body. It's called a Wii. The Nintendo Wii is a gaming console that is beyond just an ordinary game machine. I am sure most of you reading this are thinking, what's he is on about. I have just wanted to share the moments that I have had enjoying the Wii and perhaps to show you a different appreciation of something so simple.

Starting with the music, I mean the games that you're playing along with the notes, mostly with a guitar and just trying hard not to screw up the song. There's a line of games all under the banner of Guitar Hero and others named Rock Band as well. There are many versions of both games with a large variety of music that compares to you just sitting around and playing some old LP's. When you use to mix your CD's, records, anything really you could get your hands on and make some silly mix tape for a girl, thinking this will move the world for her. That time when you came home from work or school, popped in a tape in your car or walkman and just existed, enjoying the melodies of what is to come. I know, because of my age I will be speaking to a certain generation but most can understand and just rock out to plain, old, good, music. These games have created this for me and remind me of a time lost, placed in a small box, forgotten.

So now, you have the guitar strapped on, place that game in the machine and let it roll. The game boots up and suddenly, you're in this other world. Now, like most games, some take you immediately to that environment that they are trying to convey to you and others, leave you standing at the bus stop with no ride. You choose a band name, a look and feel for yourself and dive into this revisiting of thoughts. I use to love those afternoons with a childhood friend of mine, we would, always on Sunday, turn up the radio to listen to Casey Kasem's top 40. It was splendid. A tremendous variety of music and we would hear something, record it right away on our cheap tape decks, usually badly with his voice being part of the track and cutting it off a little too early so you don't have to hear his over powering grandeur again. Everything from Journey, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, The Police, Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, The Beatles, Hendrix, Steve Miller Band, Blondie, The Ramones, Wings, Elton John, Phil Collins, Blue Oyster Cult, Boston, Ted Nugent, Ray Charles, Bill Holiday, The Alarm, Queen, Bowie, Supertramp, Fleetwood Mac, and of course the endless saga of Hotel California blaring always in our ears were just some of the tunes playing over the airways and in our tape decks at the time. Truly bad hair styles but now thinking about it, a great and blessed experience to be part of this music at that time. You eyes open again; you have this guitar still on and had a little nap time while we were telling you a story. I string along with the tunes this game presents to me, it brings me to that moment and others. I could sit here and recant all the times or those times when I really thought I was a rock DJ or something, but not really going to torture you that way unless there's drinks involved. I just listen to the music, hear it like the first time and remember it but most importantly, feel the passion behind the stories they are singing about. There's a pain, happiness, truth, beauty, honesty in its notes and lyrics. Even the craziest rips by Ted Nugent or the screaming, screeching verbiage by Bob Dylan were at times, left you're wondering, is someone strangling him while he sings? Neil Young telling us of his endless searches and loves that I do adore. The Stones telling us what to do and what to drink, where and when to do it and with how many girls. AC/DC just truly trying to blow your mind and speakers so that your mother will throw your stereo so far out the window, it grows wings! Paul McCartney singing along with his wife with blissful melodies of a place he speaks of. Elton John, tugging away at every inch of your pain and your love's suffering, all in his musical enchanting voice for all to be heard. Freddy Mercury screaming and singing so softly at times with his sexy voice to explain why he likes fat bottom girls and that you should believe in yourself in some way. Steven Perry speaking to all the girls of the planet and telling all the lads that you will never be as cool as he is, never! Then there's Ozzy, ripping to shreds the notes on the paper, the bats in his mouth and the physical existence that is Ozzy.

These artists and many others can explain so many things to us. A changing of a time, in ourselves or in the place we live. All can come and go as we see it and change but for some reason, more than other memories or thoughts, these musical doors are always open.

So, don't wait. There's no need to ever surrender or give up on what is truly an inspiration to your own being. If you want to be something or do something, be that being. Just perhaps, maybe, a little time of just enjoying yourself in your home, with your Nintendo Wii and that Guitar Hero game, you can once visit a memory that you believe was lost or erased. It never was lost or gone, just had to feel it again, inside, flowing all around your body and mind. Your eyes will gleam with joy so put on that guitar and rock your neighbors into calling the cops. Enjoy the Wii, life needs a break.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_228?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=228&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The controller is very responsive and the whole thing is easy to use and to hook up.

So why not perfect? Well...

Here is ""My Wii Adventure"".

I put a reso down on a Wii at GameCrazy back a month or so ago, so I knew I was going to get one. I don't have high speed internet at home, so I went out and got a cable modem.

Well, I get the thing home yesterday, spend entirely too long getting my modem hooked up (that's another story, but not a fun one), and was finally ready go to online with my Wii!

That's when I learned that it's wireless only.

And the LAN adapter won't be out until next year.

Nooooooooooooooo!

But I rallied. My ISP doesn't provide wireless access, but eventually I get either get a Wii adapter or buy a wireless thingy for my cable modem, so that's good.

However!

The Wii had one last nasty surprise!

I went to my local Wal-Mart and bought a Classic Controller, having been told by many that it could be used to control GameCube games, and I wanted me a GameCube game! I then went and traded in a stack of DVDs at my local GameStop (I'm not very loyal to my retailers), and...

...

...

... found out the Classic Controller can't be used to play GameCube games on the Wii... *sigh*

So I instead bought a used GameCube controller and I'll have to deal with that. I returned the Classic Controller to Wal-Mart.

Despite those minor errors, and they are REALLY minor, the system is really excellent and I highly recommend it! :D","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_193?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=193&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Wii Sports is great for the whole family! Easy to operate(even for my 4 year old). The added bonus is, you can actually get a little exercise while playing! This is well worth the price! Don't hesitate to pick one up. Another thing that's nice is the games don't seem to be as expensive as some of the other systems.

I was tipped off by a best buy employee that this past sunday they would be selling 42 Wii's. I asked when they opened, and they told me 9Am. So I decided to try and get there an hour early to be first in line. well I arrived at 8:05 to find a cop car out front of best buy for shopper protection, and Best Buy was ALREADY OPEN!!! I watched person after person walk out of the store with a new nintendo Wii as I dashed inside with hopes and prayers that there was any left!

I got to customer service, and waited in line behind one other person buying a Wii. As soon as I got to the counter and asked for a Wii, some guy comes running claiming that he was first in line, and that he had been waiting in line for an hour. Well come to find out that he was in that line until he left to get to a shorter line which actually took him longer. There was only 1 Wii left, so we argued our cases in front of the manager there, and the manager said that he can't make the decision for us, so he was just gona hold onto it and sell it later. So I suggested a coin toss, and the manager agreed. I picked heads, and WON THE TOSS!!!!

So I get the Wii home, and set it all up, and within minutes I was hooked. My wife who never played video games before was hooked too! I couldn't get her off of it! We thought that Wii sports was highly addictive, and although people claim that the motion sensing is not 100% accurate for force, I think its close enough to make any game played on the Wii amazing. I was praying that nintendo would redeeme themselves after the flop of the game cube, nintendo 64, and virtual boy. My god, they redeemed themselves a thousand times over. Rayman is a blast with the Wii, and I can't see playing that game with anything other than a motion sensing controller!

Before anyone goes bashing the accuracy of force with the Wii's controllers, you tell me what other game system has ever even attempted this? I played Need for Speed Carbon, and you turn the controller sideways and use it like a steering wheel! Forget tapping directional pads, this is amazing!

Still thinking if you should buy it? well consider this, I can walk into a game stop or walmart anywhere in a 25 mile radius of my house, and pick up an Xbox or a PS3, but the Wii continues to sell out within 10 minutes of a store opening. My friends, this is the system to have. Unless you want to pay an arm and a leg for a system with great graphics and no fun gameplay. I for one am all for the fun being put back into the game rather than having flashy graphics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_229?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=229&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Wii absolutely revolutionizes video games.  My wife can't stand video games . . . and then she played the Wii with me - fresh out of the box - she played it with me as she always used to do - out of a sense of obligation, just to spend time with me, but now she plays because she can't get enough of it herself!  Once I got the hang of the controller, it became like an extension of me and I love it!  The feeling of being ""in the game"" has been redefined by this game system.  I loved the N64 (in it's day), hated the Gamecube, and now, I think the Wii may actually make me forget about gaming on any other system.  I know people at a popular game company in California, and they are all telling me that they have twice as much fun with the Wii than they do with the PS3 - I will get a PS3 (of course!) but HD graphics and a Blueray DVD are NOT going to be enough to defeat the immersive gaming experience of the Nintendo Wii.  My wife and I invited friends over to play the Wii with us, and you should've seen their mouths hanging open!  It was awesome!  Everyone of them left saying they wanted one.  Nintendo . . .

It will change the way you think about gaming, and open up entirely new experiences.

The controllers are extremely well-designed, and are modular to allow different attachments and expansions.  The motion controls allow for games to be controlled more precisely and more immersively than ever before

There are some true masterpieces on this system, but watch out for cheap imitations and low-budget titles.  ""Rapidly shake the Wii Remote"" has become the new ""rapidly press the A button,"" and cheap titles will tell you about their motion controls when really they have little or no purpose.  Read up on games before you buy them, and make sure the developers have taken the time to truly take advantage of this amazing controller's capabilities.

If you want to see what this system does best get Metroid Prime Trilogy, Super Mario Galaxy, and Battalion Wars II.  For some expanded hardware and new experiences, get Wii Fit Plus and Wii Sports Resort.  Some other excellent games are Super Smash Bros. Brawl and The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (although they don't use motion as much).

Some people criticize the Wii for being less powerful.  It has less graphical power than its competitors and doesn't support HD (although it does have widescreen and progressive scan).  But the gameplay is what really matters, and the Wii delivers an experience unlike any other.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_194?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=194&reviewerType=all_reviews"

With 4 infrared remotes, the entire family or group of friends can compete in a fun atmosphere.  Although the graphics are not high definition, the interface for gaming is where this excels.

The accompanying game disk, Wii Sports, is by far the most thrilling of the games.  It includes Baseball, Tennis, Golf, Bowling, and Boxing.  The simple interface and lifelike interactions can keep you gaming for hours.  From bowling to Golf to boxing, you can simulate the actual actions of the sport.

In addition to gaming possibilities, I have hooked mine up to my wireless network, to quickly check weather and the news.

The set up of the system is rather easy for something with so many peripherals.  Extra controllers need to be synced with your system.

My minor gripe is the infrared detecting device has fallen off of the flatscreen TV, many times.

Internal memory allows many game saves without us having to resort to accessory memory.

I have considered other gaming systems such as the Playstation 3 and the XBOX 360 but so many games oriented towards my daughter (age appropriate), I feel like I made the best choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_180?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=180&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It was 250 when I bought it. It seemed a little steep at the time, but fortunately the price has fallen considerably. With that in mind, I'd recommend the Wii to anyone and everyone. It's good fun for the price.

As most surely know by now, the Wii makes use of motion controls. I won't beat around the bush: Waggling your remote around can be both tedious and annoying on some games. But fortunately, there are enough games that use normal control schemes. The Wii Remote is often flipped horizontally and implemented as if it was a NES controller. Also, they make a Classic Controller attachment for the Wii Remote (sold separately). With that add-on, you can play quite a few Wii games with SNES-styled dual analog controller.

There aren't many graphical masterpieces on the Wii. People often say that its graphics aren't very different from those present on the N64, but this isn't exactly true. The Wii's image quality really is a lot sharper than most of the games present on that system. But since we can make some comparisons with a system released almost seventeen years ago, the Wii obviously can't compete with graphically with its HD competition.

The Wii has some online functionality. It doesn't have a social network implemented in the same way the Xbox 360 and the PS3 do, but it does have a Wii Friend code system for playing with people you know. Many games implement online multiplayers. You can also download and purchase video games from Nintendo through the Wii Shop Channel. In additional to all that, you can even browse the web from your console. But unfortunately, the web browser is pretty terrible in terms of functionality.

That's pretty much all I can say about the Wii, except this one additional thing: You can get a Wii through Amazon for as little as 70 bucks now. If you don't have a game console and are looking for a good form of entertainment, why not pick up a Wii? Most of the second and third party games are really cheap now too. The Wii is probably worth 150 bucks new, and its a downright steal for the price you can get it at used.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_175?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=175&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When it first came out in 2006, the Wii was very popular and with the demand of many gamers, the Wii was hard to find. After wishing for the Wii in Christmas of 06, my family finally found one at the local Wal-Mart.

The Wii was my to begin with but my brother couldn't resist playing it. Soon friends started coming over to the house to play Super Paper Mario,Cooking Mama: Cook Off, and Excite Truck. The Wii was the coolest thing in the world then, but later became easier to stock up on shelves. Now in 2010, the Wii can be found basically at every video game retail store. But that doesn't mean it still isn't as fun as in 2006.

The first thing about the Wii is that it is family friendly. If you want to buy a gaming system for the whole family to enjoy my first reaction would be to say ""the Wii"". But still the Wii might not be for every family because sometimes ""a non-motion"" controller is the best. The Wii is user friendly with games like the Wii Sports series that has simple controls like to swing a tennis ratchet or to roll a bowling ball.

The Wii has many functions that I probably can't all write about. But first the Wii can be hooked up to the internet. My Wii came with a wireless card and works pretty well but now I have it wired. The internet is now a big requirement in gaming, but I haven't experienced a lot with the ""Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection"". My first experience with the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection was with Mario Kart Wii with Wii Wheel. The Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection works great and playing games with people around the world makes a rain day with video games a lot more rewarding and fun.

With internet connection, the Wii can do a lot of other things like buying games with Nintendo 2000 Points Card (DSi or Wii), checking the weather, and more. When having a Wii, I highly recommend hooking it up to the internet. You can experience more with the Wii.

The Wii's motion controller is very accurate for it capabilities. I have not had many problems with the remotes except for one case but I thing the reason for it was because of a game. I still have my very first Wii remote that came with my Wii and works perfectly fine and the only sigh of age is the dust and dirt that has collected. Wii remotes are surprisingly expensive charging usually $40-$50 per remote. But the Wii remote has an add on that makes the Wii remote more ""sensitive' to you motions. Wii MotionPlus is an attachment to the Wii remote that can be attached to the base of the remote, where the Nunchuck attaches. The Wii Remote Plus - White is now out which has Wii Motion Plus built in.

The Nunchuck is quite strange looking but is comfortable when used to it. This part of the controller is used with games that are compatible.

The Wii does have a wide selection of games but the Wii doesn't stand out with realistic graphics like the Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 have. That doesn't mean that you can't enjoy the graphics on the Wii, games like New Super Mario Bros. Wii don't need realistic but excel in colorful artistic graphic that leave me entertained.

The Wii is a great system but may not be for everyone. The Wii appeals to me when I want to have fun and relax but can still entertain the gamer in me.

Bennington","Family Fun","October 28, 2009","This is actually the second Wii that I have bought, this one is for my parents for Christmas.  We love it for our family!  It has something to offer to all ages.  I have been a gamer for decades and love it.  My family is new to games and loves it.  We play Mario Kart, Guitar Hero, Wii Sports Resort.  My 4-yr-old can play at least some of any given game.  The multi-player functionality is what we like the most as it is easy to have up to 4 players on most games and everyone can play and have fun at the same time.

Overall, highly recommend for families with kids from 3 and up.  Very accessible for all ages with intuitive game-play.  Hardcore gamers may be disappointed as graphics and in-depth RPG games are lacking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Unlike PS3 and X360, the Wii was more so targeting to family friendly and group games. The Wii has a tons of games for the casual game audience and those who love social gaming, but it's also hard to find a game that's hard-core and solo because of it.

I love casual gaming, but there are also times where I want to kick some butt. Finding games that suit my need to blow up or smash some enemies is hard in Wii. They have few games that suit the hard-core gamers. (And Mario just don't cut it) The Wii doesn't cater to my RPG lover needs enough, forcing me back to my old PS2 for some action.

Another draw back is the fact that I need batteries for my consoles, which had to be the stupidest thing for the developers of Wii to do. Ever extra equipment I get for Wii needs a battery and I hate it.

Another draw back is the fact that I can't watch movies on my Wii. This is a huge drawback and just ridiculous. I like my Wii and I always wanted one. I was prepared for the lack of hard-core games they produced, but the fact that I can't watch movies, or would have to repeatedly by batteries for my controllers sucks.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_55?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=55&reviewerType=all_reviews"

While the Wii's wireless interface was originally appealing, it got boring fast. There still aren't too many games that really appeal to gaming newbies, and this is a rather expensive purchase to play ""Wii Sports"" and ""Mario Kart"" once a month. Bottom line: if you don't care for video games already, this won't make you like them much more. If you want to play tennis and bowling, you can spend less on a racket and the appropriate shoes and get out of the house.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_279?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=279&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I love what Nintendo has done with this console; instead of just mashing buttons, the player becomes more involved in the game through motion-sensing technology.  But like any system, it has its good and bad points.

First, the good:

The technology itself.  I love the Wii Remote, and how it makes the player a part of the game.  This is a technology, that when used to the proper extent on games like Twilight Princess, is amazing and completely captivating.  Nintendo hits it out of the park on this one.

Second, I like the Mii channel, where you can create a video game sprite in your own image.  It's cool.

Third, the system is easy to set up.  I had this thing up and running in less than 15 minutes.  That's my idea of a well-designed console.

And finally, the Virtual Console.  For those who grew up on Mario, Zelda, Castlevania, Kid Icarus, Ninja Gaiden, etc., this is a godsend.  Being able to play all those old-school games is simply great.

But there is the bad...

First, Wii scalpers.  Seriously, you guys are dicks.  I live in a small town and it took me 18 months to find a Wii because of you people.  It would be nice if you'd let some ordinary gamers who only want one system buy a console at retail price.  You people suck.

Second, every now and then the remote and the sensor bar don't exactly cooperate with each other.  But this is rare, and not a big deal.

Finally, there are too many middling and unappealing games for the Wii.  Most of the best stuff has come from Nintendo itself.  It seems most companies haven't yet figured out how to best take advantage of the Wii technology.  I hope they figure this out, because this is a great system and I would like to see some better games for it.

But the Wii is fun and user-friendly.  And that's what matters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_189?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=189&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Potential for the hardcore gamer.","February 21, 2007","I've been playing video games since I was [..] Each generation has showed us amazing advancements in both graphics and gameplay. However with each advancement it seems like more and more casual gamers have been turned off. People just want to be able to play and not think about control schemes and complicated gameplay. The wii seems to be the remedy for people who are normally intimidated by video games.

I myself was very skeptical about the Wii. I always loved nintendo but the gamecube was not very impressive and it seemed like this was a radical new approach that could ultimately be the fall of nintendo. Fortunately I think it is the very opposite of what I thought it would be. It's possibly the most fun I've had playing video games since I can remember.

As for the games... the best games right now are all multiplayer type games. (Wario Ware, Rayman, wii sports etc.) None of these games are very long and even though I have a LOT of fun with them I rarely find myself playing for longer than an hour at a time.

For the hardcore gamer Zelda is really the only great game out right now. (I'd say it's on par with Ocarina of Time, arguably one of the best games ever.) Nintendo's line up does look promising though. Games like Mario galaxy and Super Smash Bros are something to look forward too. 3rd party developers also seem very interested so who knows what else we'll see on the wii.

So is the wii worth it? If you are a casual player or you just want some fun you should defiantly try it out. If your a hardcore gamer and you like the zelda series it's probably a good investment but if you are interested in FPS' online play and RPG's you should probably wait and stick with your PC/PS/XBOX until the wii develops some more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_223?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=223&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I actually had the Wii over Thanksgiving weekend
and took it to my fiance's families' dinner parties and it was a huge hit! I hooked it up a few hours before the thanksgiving feast and her parents saw it. They were so impressed they were actually eager to try it. We played some Wii tennis, bowling, and a few holes of golf (golf was FUN can you believe it?).

At the actual dinner when the guests came, my fiance's mom actually asked me to show the guests the Wii--and then they all got into it too! It was crazy, never seen this many 50 yr-olds playing video games--probably because it's not like traditional video games. One of the guests said ""This is incredible! This is too much fun!"" and later he went to my fiance and told her that she has to take the Wii away from me otherwise she will never see me again.

Two days later, we tried it out at my fiance's aunt's house with her mother's side of the family. Again, her mom brought up the Wii and I hooked it up and everyone was watching or playing. Even her 9 yr-old cousin tried it and she wouldn't put it down when everyone was leaving--she was as good at the game as anyone else--Wii is this easy to use--only takes couple of tries to learn how to play. 4 player tennis and bowling action! Baseball was fun too, but only 2 players.

I mean I knew it was going to be fun for ME, but wasn't expecting it to be a huge hit across all ages. Making Miis is one of the most fun aspects of the Wii. You can make virtual avatars to use in Mii compatible games such as Wii Sports. I specialize in politicians and celebrities, including Dubya, Cheney, Hilary, Kerry, Saddam, Kim Jung Il, Michael Jackson, various Star Trek characters, etc. It's very amusing to use these fun avatars in your games: imagine tennis matches of Dubya and Cheney vs Saddam and Kim Jung Il.

The Wii has a lot of good games, like Wii Sports(which i highly recommend), Wii Play, etc. One other great thing about the Wii is that they make games like Star Wars: Lightsaber Duels where you can actually make the Wii remote as your lightsaber. They make Tennis like your holding a Tennis racket. It is really amazing! But good things have to come to an end. The graphics on the Wii aren't great like the Playstation 3 (which is better in graphics). Nintendo spent so much time on the movements of the Wii, they did not do a good job with the graphics (the Wii graphics are not terrible, but they just not as good as the other game systems).

Condon","Wiisistance is futile","November 28, 2006","The Nintendo Wii is of course Nintendo's newest system, being its 'entry' into the 'next-gen' console wars.  That being said, its difficult to not overhype this system, as it does not deliver on what many gamers believe to be next-gen  (this isn't a bad thing).

1.  Graphics:  True to Nintendo's history, the Wii does not deliver 'superior graphics capability' as its nemesi (Xbox 360 and PS3) claim, but thats never really been Nintendo's focus anyway.  The concentration is FUN, and that it is (we'll get back to this).
The Wii does not natively support HDTV.  It comes with 'dated' composite cables to plug into the TV (yellow for vid, red and white for sound).  You can order componoent video cables from online, but in my opinion its not really needed yet as not many games out now really need it yet.  Although through firmware updates later might change this.

2. Gameplay:  this is the Wii's strong point.  First off, the Wii is the first system to come packaged WITH a free game since.. the SNES years and years ago.  This game is 'Wii Sports', which as the title suggests, is a pack of sports games:  Bowling, tennis, golf, boxing, and baseball.  This is a great showcase for the innovative new controller for the system and they are great fun, even for people who dont like the real-life versions of these games (such as yours truly).  The catch is, the Wii only comes with ONE controller, so to make it a real 'play-with-your-friends' game, you have to shell out another bunch of money for additional controllers ([...] for the wii-remote, $20 for the 'num-chuck' attachment.. which is only needed for the boxing part of Wii-sports, so you could pass on that if necessary).
The system also accepts Gamecube games, and those games will require Gamecube controllers (which the system has 4 built-in ports for), along with the Gamecube memory cards (of which the Wii has slots for 2). -- and while i'm in that general area.. NOTE:  the Wii does NOT play DVDs.  Although Nintendo MAY decide to add this feature later on.  This is not too much an issue though as most people these days have at least one DVD player in the house already, if not more.

3.  Control
  The Wii-remote (Wiimote?) is probably one of the most notable 'differences' with this system.  It looks like a standard remote control, and has an 'optional' Num-Chuck attachment that connects to the bottom of it with a wire.  You pick options on the screen with a pointer, which you move about by pointing the wii-remote at the screen.  The wii-mote is equipped with motion sensors, and thus provides most of the Wii games to use a much more interactive way to play the game, such as actually swinging the Wiimote like a sword to slash the sword in the game.  This of course could be a hinderance to some game-players, and it does take some getting used to, but in the end it generally makes gaming quite a bit more fun, and in most cases more intuitive.  The controller uses 2 AA batteries, and the provided ones are standard, so if you want a 'rechargable' option you'll have to provide those yourself.
4. other stuff.
  Mii's:  one of the 'channels' in the Wii system is the 'Mii' channel.  A Mii is a graphical avatar that you create with a variety of options to make it look somewhat like you (or not).  This 'Mii' then will start showing up in games that support the Mii feature (such as Wii Sports), you can make quite alot of different Mii's, and you choose one within the game(s) to represent you.  If you're connect to the net and have the Mii's Mingle option turned on, they'll 'roam' onto your friend's Wii where they can save it to their system and it (your Mii) will start showing up in their game(s) too.  Upto 8 Mii's can also be downloaded to the Wii-remote and transferred to other systems that way too.
  like Internet:  the wii does NOT have a built-in network adaptor (wired), instead it has a wireless connection.  This has its pluses and minuses, that is, its fine and very easy to hook up IF you have a wireless router, if you dont have a wireless router, then you'll either have to get one, or get Nintendo's USB-WiFi adaptor that it orginally had marketed for the DS.  Once you are connected, you can befriend other friends' Wii's (once you exchange system friend codes) and such.  Later on when Nintendo gets the respective services going, you'll be able to check news and weather channels too.. and a web-browser (which is supposedly going to be free until Jun/jul '07).  The system DOES have optional parental controls for those who are concerned.  As far as 'what type of news' will show up in the news channel... no one can say at this point, we'll have to wait and see.
There is also the Virtual Console and the Wii Shop..
The Virtual Console (VC) is where users can download and play a variety of games from earlier systems, namely the orginal NES, the SNES, the Sega Genesis, and the TurboGrafx 16 systems.  They all cost from [...] in 'Wii points' (which are roughly 1 point=1 cent ) which can be purchased through the system or in-store via point-cards.  The Wii-shop is where you can buy these games, and/or more Wii-points, and eventually dl the browser and other utilities once Nintendo makes them available.

By and large, the system is ..GREAT, and at approx. [...] you can't go wrong...","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_198?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=198&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Like most things, you play the system a lot and then you start to realize something.  When it's just you in front of the Wii, it's not all that fun.

The Nintendo Wii was made to show off at parties.  Let people stand around and watch you act stupid and have lots of fun, but when the parties over and it's just you then you'll find yourself playing VC games and wondering why you bought that part game that never gets played anymore.

There's a couple things to remember about the Wii.  It is the only system that actually makes money from each purchase.  Nintendo chose to charge an extra $40.00 for the system so that they could make real profit.  In doing so, they've made us spend $249.99 on a system that does not do anything in HD, and a system that has far too many DS game ports to the Wii.  No 3rd party company is taking the system seriously, so we find ourselves looking at games that quite frankly are terrible.

I hope that 2008 will be the year Nintendo actually shows us some great games for the Wii.  Until then I can endorse the system, but only if your not the only person playing it.  If you are one of those alone people, then perhaps you should either stick with your computer or spend the $249.99 on a number of nice dates.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_259?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=259&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I found the motion tracking to be awful! and could'nt get into it because of it. You might as well just push buttons instead, like classic controller games. I thought the idea was great but the technology was not up to par... at that time....
Recently however my girlfeind started bugging me into getting her one for xmas, but I was not so keen on it. But then I heard about the sports resort with the new motionplus, so, I decided to give it another try. My friend lent me his console once again but this time using motionplus/sports resort.....

WOW! now we're talking!
I no longer think of wii as a gimmick, but a taste of reality of future home entertainment!
NINTENDO--BRAVO !!!!!!!
of course ps3 and xbox will now be forced to get into the action, but I must declare a big thankyou to nintendo for taking a chance and opening the doors to a new world!!!

I have to admit as extra bonus I notice it brings family together having fun while at the same time actually making it feel like you had a workout to a certain degree(definitely more than just sitting on your couch pressing buttons)

I have been playing games for over 20 years and to me the Wii is the biggest leap in the way we interact with games since the invention of the gamepad and the 8-bit NES. PS3 , X360...nice for what they are but not much new in the way you actually play the games...im not impressed. After all I have been playing games in high resolutions for many years on my PC and those 2 systems bring nothing to the table that my PC cant. But nintendo took a different approach , and its like a breath of fresh air. Incredibly fun, interactive , simple to use.

I can't say enough good things about it.  First, let me say that I'm 67 years old.  I was tired of sitting around playing and surfing the web and wanted to get off my butt.  It is the summer here in AZ and the weather is not too conducive to long outdoor activities.  The Wii fills the bill for having fun while getting fit.  I enjoy the Wii Sports that came with the console and purchased the Wii fit and love doing it every day.  I have lost weight and seem to be getting more balanced (if you have the Wii Fit you know what that means).

I just received the Wii Sports Resort game a couple of days ago and played it today. Extremely entertaining.  When I stopped working out/playing today the system told be I had been playing for 3hrs and 37 minutes.  I got carried away. But I feel great and have felt good for the rest of the day, probably due to the fact I got some good exercise. This has been great fun for me.  Even for a friend that came over and we bowled together.  Highly recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Then along comes the Wii.  At first I was not really on board, growing up with a regular controller and making fun of the people that always used to turn the controller thinking it would somehow help them out.  But then I went to a friend's house and played some of the games and it was amazing.  I swing, my character swings, I turn the wheel, my car turns, I point at something on the screen and hit my button and things happen.  But probably the best part is that others that do not like having to learn all of the buttons and joysticks of the old style controls don't have to, for many of the games you just need to move the remote and hit one or two buttons and you are playing.

Basically if you want a system that non-gamer friends can come over and pick up very quickly that offers a multitude of party friendly, easy to pick up titles, you can't go wrong with the Wii.  It is also a better option if you are busy and don't have hours every day to master games, because many of the games don't require a huge time investment to learn and have fun playing, like Mario cart, Wii Sports, or Lego Star Wars all of which I was able to quickly pick up and actually do stuff before I really had any idea what it was I was suppose to be doing...the frustration level of the games I have played so far is much lower than the majority of the hundreds of games I have had in the past.

So if you are looking for a fun, easy to learn, multi-player friendly system that offers the newest adventures of some of the all time best characters ever created, look no further than the Wii.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The only game I've played on it so far is Wii Sports, and I can't stop! I've had friends over and we play all of the games. Even golf (a sport I suck at) was fun for me! It's really a game for all ages. My 5 year old nephew has played everything and is actually doing better than most of the adults. He has also tried racing games and even my mom has bought a game for herself (that's an accomplishment since she's definitely not the video game type).

My only problems are with the controller. In golf, when you try to lightly tap the ball into the hole, it doesn't work. It just doesn't seem to pick up the movement until you move your hand backwards. That's also a problem (inverting the motion of the controller). Even if you start with your hand positioned exactly as the character's, it can invert the motion, or not even pick it up.

Also with boxing, it really can't seem to pick up the motion very well at all. We figured out the main problem is that we are punching too quickly, but even when slowing down, the controller doesn't always pick up the motion. Also, when trying to block, holding your hands completely together doesn't put your character's arms together. We realized that the only way for the characters to block is by crossing our arms. Nothing is in the way when this happens either, so it's pretty frustrating.

And in bowling, the ball will curve to the left, even when someone is holding their arm completely straight, or even try curving their hand towards the right.

Besides all those minor problems, the Wii really is fun. Everyone has really gotten into the game and made their own characters. (Which is also a fun process).","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_287?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=287&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have a fairly high end SLI equipped gaming PC running a 30"" Dell monitor. So, as far as top of the line graphics for action games, MMOs and whathaveyou, I don't need a console.

However, the Wii complements the gaming rig nicely given the controls and interface.  Naturally, the graphics are 2 generations behind in complexity, but this is more than made up for by the fun factor of the games.

Also, if you are trying to get someone that isn't into video games to start playing, this is your gateway drug.  It certainly isn't Crysis, WoW or Halo3 which probably would reinforce the negative aspects of video gaming to those that might be coming in with a negative vibe.  The reason is that the games are ridiculously simple.  Wii baseball, for example only has pitching and batting, you don't have to deal with all the 'usual' complexity of fielding, base-stealing, substitutions and so on.  You just swing the bat, that's it!  Trust me, put that controller in their hand, load up Wii sports and watch the addiction start :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_182?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=182&reviewerType=all_reviews"

While it does not boast the graphical innovation of the Playstation 3 or Xbox 360, it does provide a refreshingly different style of gaming with it motion sensitive controller.  The Wii Remote, nicknamed the ""Wiimote"", allows the gamer to operate in 3D space.  Instead of simply hitting buttons, you can swing, shove, and twirl the remote to simulate a baseball bat, a sword, or anything else you can think of.

Also an interesting feature of the Wii is ""Wii Channels"".  Each channel has a specific function, such as a game channel, a forecast channel, and even an internet channel.  However, note that'll you'll need a USB adapter or Wireless Router for channels that require an internet connection.

WiiConnect24 is the name given to the service that puts the Wii in Standby mode, which allows it to receive updates and messages.  From personal experience, I don't recommend keeping the Wii in standby.  My Wii would heat up after leaving it in standby overnight.  After a little research, I found out this was common, but I'd rather not take the chance.  The main reason for this, I believe, is the lack of a running fan during Standby mode.

Wii is a great system for never-touched-a-video-game-before novices and more experienced gamers alike.  While I'm not a ""hardcore"" gamer, I do enjoy it and try to keep up with the latest advancements.  My mother and father on the other hand try to steer clear of most ""technological"" things.  It wasn't long, however, until they were up and playing with the Wii and having just as much fun as I was.

Overall, this is a great system with a fairly descent line up of games.  I would recommend ""The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess"" as a starting game, along with the packaged ""Wii Sports"".  I definitely give the Wii 5 starts and two thumbs way up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_189?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=189&reviewerType=all_reviews"

A lot of thought went into the product and its design and it shows.  The price point is another delighter.

Tired of flashy things like graphics, gameplay, story and sound? Tired of the common drinking games and need something new to play with the frat boys? Well - then the Wii is for you. Simply put - the hardware (i.e. the controller) is unique and offers a new feel to playing video games. From there - things go down hill. Almost every game is the same (how many people would REALLY buy bowling games for the fun of bowling and not the controller?) and revolves around showing off the great technology of the controller. However, the games are simple cookie cutters of each other (with some limited exceptions)and there isn't one that stands out on it's own merits.

I own all 3 consoles (PS3, Xbox 360, Wii) and have a 12 year old son. The Xbox 360 is playing 75% of the time, the PS3 about 20% and the Wii gets the last 5% when Grandma comes over and everyone is tired of playing cards. The Wii is a perfect example of hype and ""keeping up with the Joneses"" helps sell items. Like the Tickle Me Elmo of old - the Wii continues to sell becuase they are hard to get - thus fueling the ""I want"" feeding frenzie. If you want a 'game and media' console, get the 360 or even the PS3 (though I'd argue that the game selection and online offerings of the 360 should make it the first pick). If you want a cool tech demo that Grandma can play - then the Wii is for you.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_230?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=230&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But when I try to play by myself I realize that I look like a mental patient plus I get tire of swinging my arms just for the character hit a ball.

  So the way I see it the Wii is fun and innovative to a point because the technical specs are not worthy to be call next generation (looks like they just jam an improve version of the old Gamecube inside the Wii), for me it was fun to play with family and friends not when you are alone. In the contrary the way you play the games its really innovative, but to be honest it gets old really quickly.

  Maybe I'm to old for this console in fact if you look at the game list, its clear that Nintendo intended this console to be for kids. I keep my Wii as a novelty or party trick if you will since I don't use it very often.

Mean while I get my game on my xbox360 he understand that I just want to play High Definition, awesome graphics, online first person shooters and car racing games, all that while sitting in my lazyboy.

  This is a good choice as a family fun game or for small kids, but for true gamers or people ages 16 to 35 this console will be a waste of time and money.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Nintendo was the one to revolutionize every controller that Xbox and Sony ever picked up.  Who had the thumb sticks first???? NINTENDO.  So, with that being said.......you will more then likely see sony and xbox come out with something very similar to what you get when you buy the Wii.

I stood in line for 16 hours, slept 3 hours of it on a cold concrete walk out front of my local best buy. ( I really wanted to make sure I got a system). Came home after buying all the things to get the Wii running and hooked up so the whole family can play.(ie. Extra remotes, 2gb mem card, and 3 games). The wife was not fond of the money that was spent on the system and the games, until she played it for the first time.  On the games we have played the remote response has been great, the graphics are good, and the time the family spends together playing it each night is priceless.  I give the Wii system 2 thumbs up plus some.  I recommend this system to anyone that I talk to.  You will get your moneys worth plus out of the system.  Who cares if it does not play blu-ray dvd's.  Blu-Ray = problems.  Nintendo did a great job again on another awesome system.  Get this before blowing the money on the PS3 which is going to have nothing but problems, just read the reviews on it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_218?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=218&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I mean, I totally understand if it is all about the profit margin, Amazon.com, but seriously, the Wii is garbage.

Or rather, Nintendo is garbage. I was loyal to them ever since the original 8-bit NES came out. But now?

They won't even let me get into the Wii Shopping center, and they TOOK MY MONEY WITHOUT GIVING ANYTHING IN RETURN. You know, like the points I should have received. Or access to the Wii Shop at ALL.

I know that nowadays freedom of speech is a questionable thing at best in the USA, but as a United States Soldier, I find this just a little bit disappointing.

Seriously?

My comrades deserve better than this, and not all of us are stupid enough to not understand the concept of exchanging things considered to be of value for other things that are considered to be of value. Like money.

But to be fair, I'm just going to write this off as a loss. And I will never buy another Nintendo product as long as I live.

Luckily for Nintendo, I might get nailed by an IED in the next year or two, so I doubt they would care too much about me as a lost customer.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_181?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=181&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They had a Playstation and I thought this would be a great upgrade and they'd enjoy the new features you can only get with the Wii.  Big Disappointment.  The Wii gets old very quickly.  The Wii game selection is only a fraction of what you can get with other gaming systems like the PS.  I think this console is more for teens/adults and social gatherings and not for everyday playing of sports, etc.  Therefore, looks like we'll be putting out [...] again this Christmas for the PS3....plus games - cha ching.  Lot's of hype over this console - it is pretty neat - but gets old very quickly.

Just my experience / opinion.

Made additional mistake of letting my wife try it.","December 10, 2006","We got our Wii on the launch day after spending a few hours in line the previous week to reserve it.  Initially, I wanted to re-sell the unit on eBay and then pick one up for myself next year after the initial kinks get worked out.  I noted the box could be opened and the items removed without breaking any shrinkwrap, so I decided to briefly test out Wii sports and make sure everything was working.  I also invited my wife to try it our since she is not really an avid gamer (other than a few DS games and the Sims/Animal crossing on the Gamecube.)

Those 2 mistakes ended any idea of parting with the unit on eBay - at any price.

There are lots of good reviews of these systems on gamespot and IGN.  If you are trying to decide whether to get a console and which one that is largely a matter of taste.  For us - we like party games, both with sober family or the occasional inebriated friends.  I've tried playing golf with non-gamers before and it has never been much success - you know ""push up then down then back up and press these buttons"" etc falls on deaf ears.

There is nothing to ""teach"" on how to play the Wii.  My dad who, never plays videogames but likes to go bowling is a great example.  He normally scores around 220 in real life.  The first and only time he bowled on the Wii (it was a short visit) he scored a 217.  That was higher than any of the rest of us scored - and in real life hah hah that is about right.  So if that is any measure of how well the controller works, you have to conclude it works great.

If you are lucky enough to score a Wii - pick up Raymin Rabbids with it too.  The party games are awesome.  Can't really explain why they are so much fun since they are borderline ridiculous - never-the-less my wife can't stop playing and the rail-hunt shooting rabbits with toilet plungers has yet to grow old.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_218?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=218&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Let me just say, we opened it up yesterday and we had the best night! I know the WII U is out but really this is all I need. I have Hulu plus on here. It connects to your wifi...it is easy set-up and it was only 129.00 so I bought Mario and we played both. I also bought another controller (generic version but works perfect and is cooler than the one that comes with it) It is cool because you can ""multiplay"" so Mario and Luigi didn't have to wait for the other to finish. We really had a blast and I am ready to play again tonight. If you want to connect and get off your behind get this Wii. I do triathlons and I was sweating during boxing last night.  The wii even offers all the old games on the console to buy right there. It really is amazing and fun. I would HIGHLY recommend this as a gift for ANYONE!

Buy it!","August 3, 2007","Disclaimer, I am not a hardcore gamer. I in no way consider myself an authority on game systems.  This is just my humble opinion (simply from a wife and mother's point of view).  :o)

What is most appealing to me is that the wii is starting a wave of new generation interactive game systems.  It is not just ""yet another cookie cutter"" game.  Don't get me wrong.  I have MUCH respect for all the other game systems.  But the wii finally broke out of the mold.  All game systems have pro's and con's including the wii, but this is a great little system for the money.

* Yes, the graphics won't knock you off your feet - but it's not horrible.
* Yes, the Wii doesn't come with a DVD player - it would be nice but come on, exactly how many DVD players does one household really need? It's a good bet almost every tv in your place already has a DVD player and I'm sure most people have another game system which can play DVD's.  - Not a deal breaker. (Don't quote me on this, but I heard the second generation wii should be able to play DVD's). ???????
* Yes, there should be a better bundle of accessories, at the very least a second remote and nun-chuck and some starter wii points so we can down load a couple of games online, out of the box. And why not have ankle sensors?? - But this keeps the price down a little and I do like the fact you can pick your own accessories and that you aren't stuck with unnecessary items you don't want or don't need.
* Yes, some of the games are pricey for the `game quality / game play' - I suggest reading reviews and maybe trying to rent any game you may question first and try it, before you decide to buy.  Always look for sales / good deals.  Sometimes you can find the game you want for $10 less if you take the time to shop around (especially online).  How good a game is, is in the eye of the beholder.  One person let's say a hard core gamer, may think a particular game sucks, but someone else may really like / love that same game. It all depends on your wants and needs.  Maybe you're a hard core gamer, maybe you're a child, maybe you're a person who loves video games, but didn't play much until now because the other game systems just kept getting more and more complicated, maybe you're an older person who can now play video games with their grandchildren instead of watching on the sidelines.  I'm sure ALL the game platforms have some excellent, good and very bad games. (And yes, we do have an `ok' size library of wii games already).
* Yes, there aren't a lot of dedicated wii games out yet - But they are coming, hang in there.
* Yes, some games are more fun / interesting while playing in a group, than by yourself. - It's also fun when the kids go to bed and the adults have the nerve to get really competitive and silly.  At times we have friends over and the testosterone between the men start flying. At times you can get so engrossed in the games you almost forget it's not an Xbox or PS3.
* Yes, it sucks that some of the games (designed for multi-players) you can only play in a one player mode until you beat a certain amount of levels to unlock a `code', then other players can join in. - OK --- yes this really does suck! If the game states more than one player can play, then I do expect to be able to play any game in any mode with more than one player. - But at least most of these games have a bunch of mini games included in the software which are multi-player.  This will help with impatient kids.  I do hope they don't make too many more games like that (but that's just me).

Will the wii ever measure up to the Xbox, Playstation and the other's? Most likely not, but the wii has its own niche, which at this point that is not duplicated by any of the other game system platforms.  That alone makes it a stand out game. It get you up off the couch or chair and before you know it, in some cases you've just gotten a nice little work out while actually having fun!!! Shhhhhhhh

It is a nice family game system.  I have a 5 year old daughter and a 6 year son. The whole family including aunts, cousins and grandparents have all joined in on the fun.  But the great thing is it's not just for families.

(Have your cake and eat it too!)  I didn't know this, but there these consoles out there (OK men and hard core gamers, I know you already know these consoles exist. My husband found one of these things online.  This is simply an fyi for out of touch people like myself.) They are system selectors. They are supposed to save you time and trouble. Instead of having to fool around with wires, disconnecting one game system to connect another one, you are supposed to be able to connect them all (depending how many the console supports, the number varies) through a system selector console and choose from any of gaming consoles by pressing a button.  I believe the platforms these consoles are able to support are the PS, PS 2 & 3, Nintendo Wii, Xbox & 360 and GameCube.

These are just my personal little pet peeves (everyone has their own).

- Because I have young children and have found some of the games which are rated ""E"" for everyone, you would `think' depending on the game content should be easy and fun for kids to play also, but this is not always the case.  Some of these games we have found to be frustrating for the kids.  You don't want any game to be too easy, but they should be fun and not bring kids to tears out of frustration if it received an ""E"" rating.
- They also have games which again you would think would be geared toward kids, but are rated ""E 10+"" (suggested for everyone 10 and above) - like Barnyard, Surf's Up, Ice Age 2 and Shrek The Third.  Again, not a big deal, just makes me wonder why themes like these would not be slightly more toned down. Maybe it's more of a `CYA' type of thing??
- I would have personally liked to have seen the Wii have gone one step further at launch with the interactive gear and have introduced / included ankle sensors too.  Since my upper body is already getting a work out by playing most of these games, why not the lower half too.  I would love be able to kick at the TV like I'm pretending to do a karate or soccer kick.  Maybe even some cool dance moves too. Hopefully if enough people inquire about adding a feature like this, they'll do it in the next couple of generations???

Bottom line is it's not an Xbox or Playstation, but you still can't go wrong with buying this unique Nintendo Wii System!  As everyone knows they are hard to find in stock, so grab one when you can.  We found ours just by chance.

I will admit that you shouldn't have to pay more than the $249.00 retail price. That is unless you can find a really great wii game bundle with accessories and games you'll actually use. Other wise just go for the core system and try not to pay more than $249.00 + tax.  Hang in there and just keep looking around, if you're patient and/or one of the lucky ones like us, you'll be able to find the core system for this price.

The only reason why I didn't give this system 5 stars is because even though it's a great system, as with almost anything there is room for improvement.  We'll see what the future brings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Out of the box, you get a Wii (with about 512 mb of built in storage for game saves and downloads) with one controller, a standard a/v line, and Wii sports. If you have hdtv, you'll have to buy the component cables seperately which can cost an additional 20-40 dollars depending on the brand.

The one thing Nintendo does well is making unique systems that appeals to all ages. Wii is no exception; it's small, affordable, and the primary method of control is through motion sensors. I remember when my parents bought me a NES console back in the 80s and I remember the most unique thing I have ever seen would be the light gun. I thought it was so awesome and thus far no other system has given me that much excitement until the Wii came about.

I am surprised about the motion sensor. It's very well. The included game, Wii Sports, include a verity of games that you can play. The one that stands out to me would be the boxing. It's quite amazing to see your character bounce around on screen responding to your motion. It's quite fun, and exciting. The best way to describe it would be to stand in front of a mirror and pretend to box with yourself.

The only problem with the Wii sensor is that it doesn't seem to respond to how hard you hit and it doesn't exactly know if you are in fact doing the motion correctly or not. So basically, you could be sitting down on your couch and just doing some weird lazy motion and the game will work. I don't know why people would do this though.

If you buy a Wii, I highly recommend making a lot of room for movement. It's quite fun to play tennis and running back and fort in front of your TV.

The built in 512 mb is a lot of space for people who do not go online. I have purchased about five games in total, and the space is quite useful for just saving games. I don't go online with the console, but I would imagine that if you did, you would probably want to purchase a 2 gig memory card with your Wii which can cost about 20-30 dollars extra.

The up coming game library sounds wonderful. I won't get into games, since this review is mainly about the Wii console. However, I found I like games like Mario Galaxy, Super Swing Golf 2, MLB Power Pro, Smash Bro, Zelda, and countless others. A very good set of library to play with and there are a few Mature rated games on the system as well for those looking to play M-rated games.

For those with Gamecube games, fear not. Wii is 100% backwards compatible. All you need to keep is your controller, memory cards, and of course, games. You can pretty much play any game from Gamecube on your Wii. I have a small collection of Resident Evil, Zelda, and a few other titles from my Gamecube. They all play without a hiccup on the Wii. If you have a third party controller or memory card, it may not work on your Wii.

Overall, I am pleased with Wii. I am a bit surprised that it's hard to find, though. I went to my local game store, asked for one, and they pulled it right out brand new, in the box sealed. If you plan to buy this product, what I heard is that you should go to your local game store every Friday around noon to see if you can get one. I know it's quite hard to find and that it's beyond the control of Nintendo, but I hope people don't pay too much for the console.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_176?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=176&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My 4 year old is bowling as I am sitting here writing this and he's not doing to bad - for a 4 year old. Since a lot of the games are for multiple people on the sports disk that comes with the console, you'll want multiple controllers so that everyone can play!

I can see that expansion in this is in the works as well.

If you enjoy gaming and don't pick this up (when it's ""soon"" available) you're only cheating yourself.

For everyone I know who has decided to get rid of their Wii it's because they just want a system that they can sit and play a 'normal' game that doesn't require much body movement. But what many don't take into account is that you can easily buy GameCube games CHEAP (but as a caution you must also buy the GC controllers), and play GameCube on Wii as well as download numerous classic games where you can sit as long as you want and still be entertained for hours. I have downloaded 9 games so far on my Wii. I even use the Wii to surf the internet and watch youtube videos. If you can't stand using the Wiimote for typing, just attach a USB keyboard to your Wii. I even bought a 'Classic Controller' because I get tired of putting the Wiimote on its side to play certain games.

Highly highly HIGHLY recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_234?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=234&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess

My girls (12 and a pair of 7 year olds) received this for Christmas.  My 74 year father and 45 year old brother took it over to play golf after being trounced by on of the twins in bowling.  The girls have even more fun creating Miis.  The Zelda game is too difficult for the  twins but the 12 year old can't seem to get enough of it.  I love the fact they can ""rediscover"" their older Game Cube games.  Once school began I used the incitement of playing on the Wii to get homework finished in record time.

Young","Thinking outside the box","November 23, 2007","We were talking about the Wii at Thanksgiving dinner and I ended up waking up this morning and going over to the GameStop by our house, and lo and behold almost an hour after they opened they still had some Wiis left. So naturally I got one. I have to say my wife and I are extremely impressed. We are both 25 years old and neither really played anything beyond the classic Nintendo, Super Nintendo, or Sega Genesis. The sports pack that comes with the Wii is just a lot of fun - and decent exercise as far as being in front of the TV is concerned, especially the boxing and to some extent the tennis if you play quickly. Best of all, it's an ageless system. I'm sure come Christmastime we will have everyone from my 14-year-old nephew to my 67-year-old father-in-law playing. If you are a serious gamer, you wouldn't even consider the Wii because you'd be concerned about the graphics or lack of specialty games but to the majority of us the Wii has enough to keep you entertained and at a major discount to the other next gen systems out there. If you are seriously interested, try to refrain from paying twice the price and go by your local GameStop or EBGames and if they don't have any, ask the manager on duty when the next shipment is set to come in. They are much more knowledgeable and likely to know than the associate at Best Buy or one of the other big box stores. Also check out dealnews.com for the latest postings (usually bundles for an extra $100-200 but includes extra Wii Motes, Nunchucks, chargers and games, so a good deal), if you own a Mac you can also subscribe to dealnews as an RSS feed and have quicker access when a new Wii deal is posted.

Flynn","Wii is an excellent call this holiday season","November 21, 2006","A bit of disclosure- I was excited about the Wii before I played one. I was camped outside Target all night to ensure that I got one on launch day. So I was All About The Wii.

I'm here to say that my expectations were met.

One, the bundled Wii Sports was a great move by Nintendo. It may not be as deep as other games, but I've spent a fair amount of time playing tennis and boxing and such things. And it makes for a fun party game; my brothers and I enjoyed 4-player games of tennis and bowling from the word go.

Also, it's nice to not only get a relatively inexpensive system, but have something to play out of the box. The last time I saw that was many years ago.

The controller is fun. My poor, now-overworked muscles are glad not everything has the grand gestures of Wii Sports (and yes, I'm aware that technically you only have to flick your wrist, but come on, where's the fun in that?), but it's still a neat switch up to the traditional means of playing a game. Also, it has helped some people who have been turned off by gaming in the last few years (""Too many buttons!"" is a common complaint) to give it a go again.

I can't recommend the Wii enough. Maybe it's not the graphical powerhouse that the Xbox 360 or PS3 are, but what it lacks in glamour it makes up for in fun and innovation. I am especially excited for games that come out six months from now, when developers have gotten a better feel for using the Wii control system. Can anyone say Star Wars games using lightsabers? Oh yes please.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_183?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=183&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Nintendo games, such as Mario Galaxy, Wii Fit, Zelda!!!!, Mario Kart, Guitar Hero and Rockband, and many more.

Motion sensor controller. Sure so does PS3 but at least Wii utilizes it.

Backwards Compatibility with all gamecube titles. Neither Microsoft nor Sony offers this, PS3 offers no backwards compatibility which sucks because PS3 games are like 60 bucks.

WI-FI so u can play against others, not quite up to speed with Xbox Live though but hey its free.

Virtual console Not only do you get backwards compatibility, if they dont sell a nintendo game in gamecube format, such as Zelda ocarina of time, then u can just buy it off of the nintendo store, u can download Sega( i know genesis but i am not sure if saturn or dream cast are included) NES SNES N64

Its relatively cheap $250- while the previous generation of game consoles now go for about 100 bucks such as PS2 for 130 brand new. this is a relatively cheap price, PS3 is really expensive Xbox 360 is 300 for 60g hardrive and 199 for like the crappiest xbox.

Cheap games as well - you may be telling yourself taht 50 bucks for a brand new game is not cheap but it is about 10 bucsk cheaper per game than XBOX or Playstastion.

Small- its not huge like xbox 360 or ps3 so it is easily portable and it there is no need to make room in your home entertainment system.

Pretty tame titles - if you have younger kids then this is a good console. most of the games are E or T with like maybe 10 m games total. the games are usually pretty easy but there are hard ones for the older kids such as Zelda. there are also games such as Guitar hero which are tailored for all skill levels. so if you have a multi age family you could look into a game like that. The Wii is a better choice than PS3 Or X360 because PS3 and Xbox mostly have games which contain a lot of violence and or gore and many 6 year olds dont need to play that.

While it does have many cool things about it there are also things in which it lagged behind the other consoles in.

The Wii has worse graphics than Xbox or Playstation.

i would say that the graphics are about the same as the original xbox if not a little better, it certainly isnt going to look anywhere near as nice as a PS3 or Xbox360 on a Hi-def 1000 dollar TV so if you went out and bought one of those then your wii wont exactly look like the bluray discs that the PS3 uses.

There is no ""classic controller"" like the Xbox has. so if you want to play a shoot 'em up your going to have to live with the hard to use aiming found on the wii. while it is cool to use motion sensor it sucks when you are trying to hit a small target such as on zelda, it took me like 3 tries to hit this pole and on the gamecube i can easily hit anything. It cna be very frustrating to turn around alsoas the ""aimer"" on most games is also used to look around.

The wii doesnt have the same games as xbox and Playstation, so if your buddy gets the new call of duty and you like it a lot  you better hope that your computer is good enough to play it because the wii doesnt have a lot of hit titles such as Fallout 3 oblivion Call of duty 4 and call of duty world at war, midnight club and such. so if you are a hard core gamer then get a nd xbox or playstation because i find it anoying when i hear about a lot of cool games but i dont have an xbox and none of my friends do so i never play the new games such as Halo 3.

no hard drive. if you play a lot of games then you will find it frustrating to use memmory cards in place of the 60 gig or 120 gig hard rive on the xbox.

the wii is a great toy to play with but it can be frustrating when you dont have access tio the games and features found on other systems, the best bet is to get yourself a good computer or and xbox, xbox is cheaper, and then buy a wii as well, many people dont have the budget so if you like the sound of Wii then you probably wont be disapointed but if you are into games like Gears of war or halo and all of your friends have those games buy and xbox you it makes more sense also it is cheaper to buy xbox controllers than wii controllers so if you want to have a ""Halo party"" then xbox is cheaper","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_197?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=197&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My friends and their families really like it, theyre all addicted to it, they all want to get their own now. One of them even wants to get one for their work.

The Wii Sports is what my friends and i play mostly so far. We love bowling and the golf. And tennis is fun too. The boxing game actually put us all in a sweat! It was so much fun.

Last night we had a party at our friends apartment and everybody wanted to play bowling, it was hilarious, but again, GREAT FUN.

So theres one of the very very strong points about the Nintendo Wii, is that its the best multi-player/ party system ever. You actually are physically apart of the game, you use the remote and swing it like a baseball bat and hit a homerun, or knock a golf ball 100 yards away or connect the analog stick nunchuck to the remote and use it to knock someone out in boxing. Its awesome.

It gets everyone involved and its most excitment ive had playing videogames ever, becouse your not just having to sit there twingling your thumbs, mashing on buttons....you actually can get up, hold the remote, bring it back, and follow through like your hold a bowling ball and release the B button (back TRIGGER) to let the ball fly down the lane to get another strike!

I even heard theres going to be games where you can use the remote as a SWORD! that is sweet! I love that.

The controllers are pretty accurate and precise. And you can even adjust the senistivity of the remote and things.

When i play by myself at home, theres more to love about the Wii becouse i connect to the internet and check the weather and news on the fly. I can even get my 5 day forcast! You can even buy the Wii Internet Channel, that lets you browse websites, which is very affordable and is a one time price of 5 dollars ( a.k.a: 500 points)

Speaking of the points, if you connect to the internet on your wii, regardless if you have the seperate INTERNET CHANNEL or not...Not only can you check your local, national or international weather and news, but you can go on the WII STORE and either purchase of download Wii Ware or go into the Virtual Console section and purchase and download classic beloved games like the original super mario, metroid, contra, ninja gaiden, zelda, donkey kong and much more, even sega games! and super nintendo and nintendo 64 games!

Every week, they add more games to the catalog of classic games, so it will get even better as time goes on...and they add the not-so popular games too, so if you have an old hard to find favorites like Maniac Mansion or Skate Or Die 2, its possiable those games will one day be released, besides all the popular high demanded games like Double Dragon and Mega Man.

And i must say, the Browser used for surfing the Internet Channel is easy to use, and you can do pretty much anything on your computer besides saving random things, but you can go on myspace and youtune with ease, just as an example. It uses the critically acclaimed OPERA browser and using the remote is pretty user friendly , and easy to use. You can zoom in and out of pages easily. Its a good browser and will probubly become more upgraded with features in the future, like having an equvilent to right clicking and saving images or something. Still, you can go back and forth, save links as favorites and search for stuff effortlessly. Its easy, trust me.

 And did i mention the Wii has a photo center ??? Yep, thats correct.
Use an SD memory card, put it into the wii sysytem, and view pictures youve taken. You can even do some basic editing and add a little bit of fun effects to them, or make a puzzle game out of one your photos.

I also found out, the photo center played my video i took at a concert...my camera happens to use the AVI video format and i was suprised it playing it. So the wii can play your videos! I know for certain AVI vids are compatiable, and im sure other ones are to, like WMV probubly as well, or perhaps MPEG or MOV.  Though i havent tried to edit the videos, so im not sure if you can edit a video. BUT I DOUBT IT.

 The Mii chanel they have is a place where you can create your own little guy that looks like you or others, using various selection of traits, like eyes , hair, skin color, noses, height, weight, and stuff...pretty basic but fun, not to mention how you can adjust the size or color of those characteristics, or move them up down or whatever. Pretty customizable. But remeber, they are like cartoon-ish versions of you and others, that you can use as your player selection when you play games like Wii sports or are involved in various wii communites or online play and messaging.

Oh ya, that reminds me, you can add peoples Wii ""friend codes"". Its a 16 digit numeric code that you have for your particular sysyem, and others can add you or you can add them to your ""friendlist"" as it were, to communicate or play against in games like madden football or pokemon or whatever other wi-fi/online compatible games.

The online play is absolutly free, but the closer the person lives to you, the better the smoothness of the experience. For example, playing someone from around your state or city has a better online experience sometimes than playing some guy living in Japan or Antartica...like if your playing a shooting game or a racing game. So playing people atleast in your own country might be more fluid and have a quicker connection.

But im hoping in the future that nintendo will offer an OPTIONAL premium service for a small montly that lets you have a stronger connection and access to a faster server or what not, with some extra perks, yet still offering the basic free online play. I hope they will think of that to contend with services like Xbox Live.

Remember you can have up to four controllers for the wii, not to mention it has a hidden compartment of sorts for your old gamecube controllers and memory cards, so can still use your gamecube games, like Zelda:The Wind Waker or Super Smash Brothers Mele or Mario Sunshine or whatever.

This is the most back-ward compatiable game sysytem ever, which is great. And the system actually puts you in the game! You take aim at a the brain washed cult following in Resident Evil 4, you blow them away with pin point accuracy. You knock the ball out of the park in Wii Sport's baseball, you make a grandslam or strike your friends out throughing a lightning fast pitch.

Speaking of Resident Evil 4..... its the first game i bought for the wii, and its beatifully dark game, with photo-realistic visuals, and horrifying characters that band together to kill you. Like the psychotic towns people and the guy with a chainsaw...its scary and creepy and gave me the chills. Reload your gun with a movement of the remote or swing your knife.  You connect the anolog nunchuck thing to the remote and that lets you move around while the remote lets you aim with the cursor. Its awesome. The best Resident Evil game ive ever played, and the Wiis motion sensing controlls make the game so much more fun, you are more involved in blowing a freaks head off. Not to mention the fact that the remote has the the rumble vibration feature and has a small speaker on it, that makes sounds for various moves you make, for various games, like hearing the clang of two swords meeting in battle. Very very cool, talk about your surround sound.

 The Wii is the greatest system ever made becouse it gives everyone the chance to have so much fun, and thats what its all about ...FUN...and getting everyone involved...your friends and family. It actually makes video games an EVENT, me and my friends are actually excited about video games more than ever now. Parents, bosses, grandparents, kids..everyone can pick up and play and inevitably love the Wii. Its so inviting and easy to use. Its great. Its the great gameing system ive ever seen, thats very affordable and state of the art at the same time, really revolutionising and changing the way we all look at video games now.

This is TRULY video gameing for the new millinium, for the future, for the 21st century. No more sitting on around pushing on buttons alone. Now when you pick up that sword, bat, or machine gun, that machine gun is in your hands, and what you do with it and how you use it is all up to you. Actually swing that sword, actually smack that ball, actually reload your gun.

Mark my words...Wii Will Rock You!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_199?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=199&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Atari, Coleco, the original NES, Genesis, Super NES, and TG16.

Then, I have to admit, games stopped being fun. They were work with 50 buttons and combos to memorize. All this work for something that is supposed to be relaxing after a hard day at the office?

My parents asked me if I wanted a WII for Christmas. At first I told them no. That was until I played it. My Uncle got one and I loved it. The game play was incredible - natural movements with an occasional one or two buttons. I had to have one and joined the rat race to get one for Christmas. I couldn't find one but the manager at EB came through for me on the day after. I was so excited.

When I got it home and hooked it up, everyone was immediately impressed with how easy and fun it is. I can't tell you the number of Christmas, New Years, and January WII parties I've had. One of the best features is the Virtual Console that lets you download classic games by using WII points. Nintendo releases 4 games every Monday with games from the original NES, SNES, N64, Genesis, and the TurboGraphix 16. I've downloaded a few but so far my favorite is Bomberman '93 for the TurboGraphix 16.

Pros: great price, built in WiFi, comfortable controllers, downwards compatible with Game Cube games, controllers, and accessories, Virtual Console allows you to play the classics

Cons: virtual console games are too expensive ($[...] for a NES game you can get at Martha's garage sale down the street for [...]¢), only comes with one controller/ numchuck combo (an extra $[...] for the controller and $[...] for the numchuck)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_178?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=178&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My wife actually asks me to play the Wii with her this is a feat that wouldn't likely be recreated with the xbox360/PS3. If I have company over my Xbox 360 collects dust while the boys and girls get amped up for some Wii bowling. I have also gotten the baby boomer generation to join in with me and this would never happen with titles such as Halo or Metal Gear Solid (this is a generalization of course).

The Wii is the first real physically active console (I have actually been drippinng sweat before playing the Wii). Every game involves you to actually move around whether it's swinging your controller like a bat, bowling ball, racquet, boxing glove (this involves holding two controllers in your fist) or you name it. Gone will the days that gaming is just a sedentary experience. What a great way for young kids to play fun games while actually burning calories. Speaking of kids the Wii games tend to be family oriented so it will be much easier to find fun games that exclude all the gore/profanity(always check the ratings though).

The Wii graphics are good at best. Don't expect this console to be keeping up with the 360/PS3 because in this department it simply doesn't. This system lacks next gen graphics but that's overall ok because of the completely new direction the Wii has gone in.

My final thoughts are buy the Wii knowing that this is a family oriented console. Most popular main stream title games out there will be second rate on the Wii. Some of the finest Wii games are those made specifically for the Wii due to the completely different controls, like Wii bowling. This console really earns it weight in gold when played in a group settings.

Extra Note: The Wii Fit is really a must buy for the Wii it's going to cost an extra $90 but it's worth it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_183?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=183&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm not willing to dish out the money for a PS3, its just too much and honestly I don't need another dvd player (let alone an expensive one I can't really tell a difference in).  But Nintendo Wii went far beyond my expectations.

I'm usually against camping out.. but for some reason decided it was worth it.  I'm glad i proved myself right.  6 1/2 hours at the local target did it.  Took this baby home and after a nap and shower.. we were ready to go.

I love it.  It's fun, innovative and unlike anything else.  The controls are comfortable once you get past the initial shock.  The system and all the games I bought (5)  plus extra controller and nunchuck... are still cheaper then what I've spent thus far on my Xbox360.  I'm definitely a happy ""camper"".  This sleek little baby will definitely be loved and nurtured ;)

I have to say though.. as far a the lazy video gamer stereotype goes.. this broke that i truly believe..  I've been playing wii sports and Rayman for a few hours and my arms are tired.. haha.  And yes this is a family item.  My dad who last played video games when PAcMan, centipede and pong were in actually took an interest.  We taught him how to bowl and play golf.. he had a blast as did my technologically impaired mom.  And within a few weeks... nintendo plans to have 62 titles for our selection.. who could ask for more?  REally the selection out now is relatively good and broad and plentiful compared to the launches of late and even the last gen of these consoles.

I'm happy and definitely would do it all over again.  Nintendo seems to be making a decent effort to satisfy demand.  i dont think you all will have to wait that long to get your hands on this...

I am trying to be as informative and educational as possible so that people can make a smart purchase. A disclaimer right up front, I'm writing this review to help people whom I feel might have incorrect perceptions based on mainstream media hype for the Wii console. In my apartment, I do have an Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii, and have many hours of experience will all of the systems.

What is the Wii?
-The Nintendo Wii is the successor to the Nintendo Gamecube console, and is presumably in competition with the Microsoft Xbox 360 (""X360"") and Sony Playstation 3 (""PS3"") consoles. However, there is considerable debate as to what degree the target market of the Wii overlaps with the target markets of the X360 and PS3. That is not to say that the X360 and PS3 are not targeting young, new, and/or female gamers, as they both are, nor that the Wii is not targeting experienced videogame players, as it is.  But there is considerable evidence, especially in the Japanese market but also in America, of people who had zero prior interest in any videogames at all, purchasing Wii systems for their interest in titles like Wii Sports, Wii Play, Wii Fit, Mario Party, and possibly other simple ""party-game"" style titles. This is an important distinction to make because people, including children, who actually play videogames will often quickly grow tired of the aforementioned games because they lack any of the depth of play that has been associated with good videogames since before Nintendo released its first system in the 1980s. (so this has nothing to do with the graphics capabilities of the Wii, but the character of its popular game titles).

But aren't good games available on the Wii?
-Yes, absolutely. Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Mario Galaxy, and The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess are a few examples of superb videogames available exclusively on the Wii that exemplify the ""depth"" and ""character"" of videogames that I was talking about before. However, the relevant question is whether there are perhaps more and better videogames available on the X360 and PS3. To answer this question, I would have to say that yes, there definitely are. To offer objective statistics to back up this assertion, I point you to Game Rankings or another website that aggregates professional videogame reviewer scores and combines them to an overall consensus score out of 100%. Lets say that ""great"" games are those that have a consensus score of 85% or greater. Using this objective metric on Game Rankings, we find that the Wii has 9 ""great"" games while the X360 and PS3 have 34 and 20 ""great"" games each respectively.

But graphics aren't everything, right?
-Yes, again that's absolutely true. In the same way that I think some Nintendo Entertainment System games from the late 1980's are better than some videogames being made now, its also true that some Wii games are better than some games being made with better graphics but overall worse gameplay for the X360 and PS3. While graphics are not everything, they're certainly something. Compare better graphics with better camera technology, special effects, and bigger production budgets in movies. Spartacus, the 1960 film starring Kirk Douglas, is a great movie. But is it better than Gladiator, the 2000 film starring Russell Crowe? Despite any feelings of nostalgia, I think most people will agree that Gladiator is the better film. In the same way, videogame developers work extremely hard to leverage the better graphics capabilities of the X360 and PS3 to make games that are overall better. The latest important trend is videogame design has been the adoption of techniques from blockbuster movies to add cinematic qualities and the feel of ""high producion values"" to videogames. Start up a game of Call of Duty 4: Modern Combat, available for both the X360 and PS3, and you're put in the rear seat of a rickety passenger car, traveling a middle eastern city in the middle of warfare chaos. You watch as you speed past people in gunfights, buildings exploding out in the distance, civilians scurrying for cover, etc. The Wii simply lacks the hardware capability to pull off the same kind of scenario. Its graphics are incapable of allowing the player to ""suspend disbelief"" for a real-life scenario.

In conclusion:
-The Wii is a decent system, and has several exclusive titles, predominately made by Nintendo, that videogames players would truly enjoy getting to. However, the X360 and PS3 are better systems with more and better games, and for anyone who is known to play videogames, I would always recommend an Xbox 360 or Playstation 3.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_256?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=256&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I signed up to be informed of which website gets it first and it wasn't cheap. But I feel it was well worth it in the end. It did however not want to play my Brawl game so since it was under warranty it was no big on getting it fixed. I was happy since day one though up until I had to sell her away. So I do highly recommend this product from this seller to anyone whos always wanted a Nintendo Wii system close to new without having to spend more for the quality of the product.

At first you may be like, huh?  But, after a bit of Tennis or Baseball, etc.  it is very cool!!!  It's a fun system but you also get excersice with the physical interaction.  My son loves it and the price is nice.

BTW, the wireless adapter built in to the Wii is funny and may need to be refreshed a bit to see your SSID, happened to me when all pda/laptops see it immediately.

I gave a 4 for the slow internet, lack of digital sound and HD support and shortage on component video cables, but the innovation and excercise factors (price, too) kinda make up for that.

The Wii has a real nostalgic, but fresh feel to it. The library of games provide the good ol' classic characters with a fun new experience. Up until now the N64 has pretty much been my favorite console I've ever had, but the Wii might replace it's title as my fav.

Pros:
-The new Wii remote makes the game more fun by making you feel more part of the game.
-The console itself is very sleek and stylish.
-It is very small and lightweight, which is good if your spending the night at a friends house and you want to bring it over.
-Its really fun messing around with the Miis, and games like Mario Kart Wii let you play the game as your Mii.
-It has up to four ports where you can use the GameCube controllers and two slots for GameCube memory cards.
-It comes with Wii Sports which help people new to the console get used to the controls, and the mini games are pretty fun.
-The whole family can get involved.
-It has WiFi.
-It's very quiet and does not heat up as much as Xbox 360s and PS3s.

Cons:
-Even though the controls are real cool they are a bit awkward at first and may take some time to get used to.
-It does not support HD. This isn't a problem for everybody, but I have an HDTV and I would have liked to see Mario in high-def.
-In order to get a 480p resolution you have to buy an extra component cable.
-It does not have an ethernet port. I use WiFi, but this is a problem for people who don't have WiFi.
-Graphics. I know it's not a big deal, but for some reason I feel like I'm getting an enhanced GameCube sometimes. I know it was Nintendo's intentions to make the Wii more appealing to families, but when the graphics are not much of an improvement from last gen consoles I feel a bit ripped off.

I definitely recommend the Wii to everyone, with the exception of the hardcore gamers. It's great fun and it's what video games should be. If you loved all of Nintendo's past consoles you will surely love this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_215?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=215&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Ive read the stats for months now, know the pros and cons of all of them, can talk long winded hours on each of them.  They all have their strengths.  However, standing here, in my living room, roughly 3 days after hooking up the wii next to the other two next gens, and watching the reaction it gets from my friends, their kids, even their wives/husbands... its really hands down as far as which is getting more traffic.

Now we know the graphics arguement.  But you really REALLY have to consider this thought process.... what do graphics matter if the game play is no different then it was on the past generation?  If there is no difference in response, in condition, then the development is purely surface.  A common theory is that we have entered into a stage of development where we dont create new, we simply improve upon the old.

Wii may be an improvement on old concepts, but it is a new.  It is not simply wireless remote with tilt response.  it is a vast responsive system.  It measures speed, and angle, gyration.  its connection to the system is very tight.  I had my doubts about how responsive it would be.. I was foolish to doubt.

Going back to graphics and game play.  The demo disc (wii sports) that was included is a good example of group play.  Bowling and golf are very strong titles, offering complex control of your tilt and curve of your remote.  In bowling, A friend of mine has a wicked slice and was able to simulate that perfectly by going through the same motions he does when he bowls.  Same story with golf.

Tennis and Baseball is about  your swing. You dont control the physical movement of your player, done automatically, but it shows the potential.  Also your pitch is influence by your throw style as well.

Boxing requires the most response from the control system, and for the most part delivers.  In the heat of the fight, you tend to move less controlled, and the remote wont throw a punch unless it is a solid punch/jab, so half-a** punchs dont always register... DONT TAKE THIS the wrong way, its very minor and not often this happens.

Again, the graphics are not PS3/360 level... but why do they need to be.  We arent talking atari 4600 or ps1 level here.  We are talking crisp graphics that even the ps2 would have balked at.  smooth lines, blurs, clean.  Its nice and eye pleasing.

Outside the game, you can make your own avatar (mii) for you and your friends, if you have internet, you can set them to wander other systems, and in the end you can even have mii visitors.  The virtual console channel (its all set around channels) lets you buy new games from older consoles, so if you have the option, buy the classic controller (it hooks to the remote, so its wireless) too.  cost is no more then [..] per game, so enjoy the potential that is supposed to grow weekly (wait and see).  More channels like weather, news, and browser, are to be unlocked through january... here's hoping for more.

So, if I didnt own all of them what would I do?  Buy the wii first.  BEST all around FUN machine.  The graphics are pretty, the game play is tight, and the enjoyment certainly lasted a LOT longer then it did on the others.  More then this, it fulfilled its promise, people who arent gamers were playing, laughing, and having fun.  And then they did something else, they wanted to come back and play it more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The last time I owned a video game console and really even cared about games was with the Sega Genesis. (Yeah, I know, it's been a long time.) When I heard about the Wii, it was the first time in years that video games interested me. So I watched and waited. I read the reviews. And finally, after waiting eight hours in snow and cold weather, I snagged a Wii. Amazingly, it actually exceeds my expectations. I didn't realize how well the motion sensor would work. For Wii Sports in particular, you are literally making the same movements you would make in reality when playing these games. You won't understand it until you try it yourself. Get a Wii; it is fun and amazing technology. You won't regret it.

P.S. Making Mii characters of yourself and your family members is very fun. :-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_200?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=200&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The processing is always quite clear and impressive, the virtual console is amazing, some of the specialty games ROCK (woot for Super Smash Brothers Brawl!!!!), and it's just a great system. The wii controls are perfect on most games (just be sure to check game reviews BEFORE you buy them, cause some games have really bad controls. I'd recommend using some video game review magazine or website, just to check out that the game you want isn't a stinker.

Everyone complains about the pricing of the system, and its graphics. Well, the system is 250 bucks if you can find it new and not on ebay, and  a good quality xbox 360 is still 350 bucks, while a good ps3 is 400 bucks, so actually, no, they are NOT the same price of a next-gen console. As for the graphics: Yes, they aren't anywhere near the ps3 or xbox 360, but I think that video games have gotten to a point where the graphics are good enough to allow just about any game to achieve its full potential, so unless you have a big 50"" HD television, the low graphics really won't mess you up, cause they DO look good.

Simple and plain, this is a great buy. Nintendo makes great games, the controls work well, the hardware and system updates are fluid, and I love everything about it. If I really had to complain about anything, it would be the cost of batteries for the wii remote. But hey, that's what rechargeable batteries are for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_194?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=194&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It also seems to have real trouble connecting to some modern WiFi routers, I've yet to get it online with mine.  If you're prepared to use it in isolation, these are fine.  But the platform it sunsetting so you may be disappointed if you expect it to work the way it would have in 2008.

In fact, before getting a Wii I would have thought that impossible.  However, such is the appeal of this ground-breaking game system that I actually have to fight for time at the controller.

There are a lot of reviews here for the Wii, and if the previous thousand or so don't convince you to buy one then my review probably isn't going to be the tipping point.  However, if you are sitting on the fence over this, then I say fall off.  Go and get yourself a Wii.

The Wii is so utterly and completely different from previous gaming systems, not only because of its unique controller but also just because of the variety of people who are willing to play.  Everyone wants to give it a go, and everyone is hooked once they do.  The Wii is perfect for family gatherings, because everyone plays together and has a good time as well.

The fact that you are standing up and moving around makes a huge difference as well.  We worked off some Thanksgiving turkey playing tennis, and some old-fashioned brotherly aggression with the boxing game.

If there is a single sore point to the Wii, it is that there really isn't any game more fun than the Wii sports that comes with the system.  I am hoping that Nintendo will invest in some games now that the system is taking off, but we aren't there yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_190?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=190&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Ege/Acedoh","It's a Wii world out there","December 24, 2006","I have noticed something about gaming the past several years.  It seemed to become a cumalitive effect and eventually would have caused another crash in the console market.  That is until Nintendo took a fierce and wonderful chance.  By creating a console that did not provide hi-def graphics or digital sound or for the most part on-line gaming.  It almost sounds like I am talking about last gen gaming.  Except I am talking about the best gaming console on the market right now.  The Nintendo Wii has brought fun back into gaming.  Whether you are playing with just yourself or 3 friends the Wii is the most innovative gaming device anywhere.  I have had more fun than I have had in many years playing these games.  I am the proud owner of six games.  Even with that said there are still a few more quality titles I have yet to invest in.  Sometimes it's not so easy to get used to using body movement to control a character on screen.  Some games are actually a little difficult to get used to.  Blame that on many, many years of traditional gaming.  Although now I am having a lot of fun and am not afraid to admit it.  I was die hard Sony fan over the past several years.  I am now a proud Nintendo owner.  They have done what others don't.  It may be what is needed to shake up the gaming industry that has become very stale and unimaginative the past decade.  If gaming is going to reach the mainstream it must take bold steps and chances like we see with the Wii.  Not everyone wants cutting edge graphics and sound.  It's about the games...","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_217?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=217&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I had always been a hardcore Nintendo fan so I wanted them to succeed, that's why I got it the day it was released.

  The Wii has great potential because I believe it is beginning the path that videogames need to take.  Videogames have the potential of easily transitioning into more personal experiences, like in ""Minority Report.""  I gave Nintendo the benefit of the doubt but as time passed I realized they were not attempting to make a splash, only a ripple.

  After a year, regret set in.  If I could some how keep my virtual console games for perhaps the Wii2 or 3, I would sell this thing in a heartbeat!!!!!

I love the Wii and it is a ton of fun for the whole family, but there are a few things that it is lacking.
1.  No HDMI (component video with an extra cable is the best you will do)
2.  No digital audio (no coax, optical, or HDMI audio)

I am a little confused why Nintindo would leave these things out.  Even the cheapest DVD players for the past 2 years have had HDMI.

But, if you can overlook these things, the Wii is great and you and your kids will love it.

Worth Camping Out For","December 23, 2006","My wife and I had to camp out at Target at 4AM last Sunday to get a Wii, and I have now had a few days to play Wii Sports, Zelda: Twilight Princess, Call of Duty3 and Rampage: Total Destruction on the Wii. All I can say is Wow! This is the way video gaming was meant to be. Aiming weapons has never been better or more intuitive. After playing the Wii for several hours I went back to an old-style controller to play on the PS2 and it felt like I had stepped back in time. The other video game console manufacturers simply don't get it. Pressing buttons is no substitute for imitating the real action, I don't care how hi-def the graphics might be. The graphics on the Wii are as good as you can get on a standard TV anyway. Game play is the real key to satisfying entertainment. I don't want to have to pause a game to look at the manual just to figure out how to swing a sword, I want to just swing! With the Wii, this is exactly what I can do. The result is that you feel emancipated from the controls, and you can get right to the action. Fortunately there are some truly awesome games already available for the Wii, such as The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, one of the most amazing games I have ever encountered. The gameplay in Zelda is so intuitive that it makes you wonder why the other video game companies make you press hard-to-remember button combinations instead.

My wife and I are 43 years old and have no kids, so we bought the Wii just for ourselves. The Wii is turning out to be quite addictive, despite the fact we have only three games we bought for it, and roughly two-dozen for the PS2 and the GC. My wife and I have had a blast playing the bolwing game in Wii sports, which with the surround sound and the real-life controller action felt as close to being at the bowling lanes as it is possible in a video game. Hard to beleive that this much fun was so cheap compared to the other alternatives!

I can't wait to see what the next installment of Metroid Prime will be like on the Wii. In the meantime, I'll be enjoying Zelda: Twilight Princess, one of the most fun-to-play games I've ever played.

I can tell you that I fully expect to be buying only Wii games in the future, and if a game will have Wii and non-Wii versions, I'll always be buying the Wii version, even if I have to wait for it. The Wii-mote is that much better to use than any other controller.

Overall, the Wii is a definite must-have. Seldom has a single innovation changed the quality of a product as much as the Wii-mote has for video games.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_213?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=213&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I must admit, I rarely write reviews, but with consoles being so pricey, we all need to hear enough info to make a decision on which one to go for.  I picked up a Wii on Launch Day - 11/19 along with Zelda Twilight Princess, and here's my take:

This is the MOST sensory encompassing video game experience to date.  Pure user interface genious.  You WILL feel more like you are in-the-game than EVER before!

  - For the novice:
You have to deal with no more than two buttons in each hand (most of the time), one control stick, and a few wrist flicks.  While the motion sensitive activies change the range of motion (sword attacks take different motion swings than shooting an arrow, or fishing), the motion is how you would think it would be -- I'm pulling and winding my reel when fishing, and swinging my arm and stabbing when sword fighting.  Don't worry, the beginning is basically a tutorial teaching you how to use the controller (although, the fishing explanation confused me, not having played the last two Zelda games -- if you get stuck, try dropping your rod in the water, waiting for the bobber to go under, then yank the remote back toward you like you're trying to pull in a big fish).

  - For the hardcore gamer:
You have 4 motion sensing moves across 2 hands, doubled when you have A-button pressed, plus they change for each weapon/item, providing you a wide range of ""activities"" to master.  Plus the IR sensor provides a target to shoot slingshot bullets and other ranged weapons.  Also, there are +/-, 1, 2 buttons for maps, menu options, and other utility screens.

  - For the socialite:
The Wii has a message system, digital avatars which you can share with your friends and parade around, a digital photo sharing system, and soon weather and news headlines across the country.

  - Cons:
Message System:  Text typing is tedious -- Nintendo needs a word recognition program similar to cell phones.

Remote Control:  Recommended distance from the sensor is 2'-8'.  My couch is ~ 12'-15'.  The control actually works suitably from that range except for the IR sensor.  The screen target, moved by the IR on the front of the remote, jiggles due to the distance.

Weather & News Aren't Available Yet:  It says I need to download an update, but when I do, it then says there is none to download.  (I expect Nintendo will fix this soon enough w/ a software patch).

4-Player Mayhem:  I have yet to test four adults jammed together in the 2'-8' fan of controller recognition space while flailing their arms to work the motion sensor and see if it works flawlessly.  I'm worried about my 6', 250lb buddies bumping into each other as they use the motion sensors.  We'll see...

  - Overall:
While the graphics pale in comparison to the PS3, the new user interface makes you feel more into the game than EVER before.  You don't get the best of both worlds with the SIXAXIS controller of the PS3 -- it just can't do the motion sensing like two separate controls - remote & nunchuk can provide.  This has really rejuvinated my gaming desire more than any other launch system.  All these years, we've been getting graphical facelifts, when finally, Nintendo has decided to perform a complete body overhaul.  Graphics aren't the only important aspect of gaming -- don't believe me?  Try the Wii.

  - Tips:
1) Gamecube controllers and memnory cards are ONLY used for GC games.  You can't use the Wii controller, nor it's internal 512MB memory.

2) Wii Classic controller is used with a remote to wirelessly play the classic games that you download -- Nintendo, SNES, Genesis, Turbographics 16, N64.  But you can use the gamecube controllers to play the classic games.

3) Any SD memory card will work -- you don't need any special Wii only card that costs $$$ because it has Wii stamped on the packaging.

4) It has plenty of parental controls to make sure your kids are only talking to their friends, and to prevent them from buying every virtual console game listed there without your password.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_175?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=175&reviewerType=all_reviews"

There are myriad party games and some innovative titles, but anyone looking for a heavier game experience may be disapointed. After beating Twilight Princess, I hardly touched the system. In fact, I just sold the wii and and plan on purchasing a 360.
However, the wii is a real crowd pleaser with family and those who do not typically play video games. It's been said a million times before, but it's true. The hardware is very reliable, and knowing Nintendo, they will eventually come out with some unique/ compelling software.
For me though, marginally improved graphics from gamecube ports got tired relatively quickly.

Now, it sits in a closet unused, except occasionally when a friend comes over and wants to try it.  When I want to play vidoe games I want to sit down and relax, but with the Wii you have to always be moving around.  Also, they have hardly any fun games.  Now we have an Xbox 360 and we love it.  We've had it close to a year now and still have fun with it.  Microsoft does a great job making fun games, and not making to many of the same ones (give Mario a break for once).  Notice how Microsoft didn't knew when to stop at Halo 3.  So if you have smaller children, get them a Wii.  Otherwise get them a 360.

EDIT: If you have never owned a Nintendo console they used to be great.  It is 2009 and I still play with my N 64.  Some of the best games that were ever made were with Nintendo, but they have begun to soil their name sadly.  I think Microsoft is the way to go nowadays (The PS3 is way over priced and they have very few exclusive games.)

All that being said, Nintendo does a fantastic job with hand-helds.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_247?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=247&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Once I got it, the first thing I tried out was the Wii sports package...  No, actually, the first thing I tried out was the Wii menu system.  This system allows you to navigate the different options available, including the Wii shopping channel, the `Mii channel,' the Disc channel, (Can you see that all options are `channels' here?)  The interface is spectacular in design, but for a nearsighter, it lacks in function.  Unless I memorize the different blocks and what they lead to, I don't know what I'm aiming at.  Not a big deal there.  Enough colors and designs to let you know, and once you've traversed the routine questions, you know which bubble is OK and Back, Yes and No, etc.  The biggest difficulty for me is finding a spot where I'm close enough to see what's going on, but far enough away for the Wii sensor bar to properly detect my motions.  (Too close and it won't pick them up, or the motions are exaggerated.)  On to the games.

The games present a somewhat different difficulty for a nearsighter.  As opposed to standard menus, your environment is constantly changing.  Also, in order to read some of the request prompts, you have to have your pointer on the screen...  Guess what happens if you're too close to the screen, reading the text?  Yep, it goes away, replaced by ""Point your remote at the screen to continue.""

After making a `Mii' representation, I started playing the Wii Sports.  This is HILARIOUS, seeing a cartoon version of yourself bowling, in a boxing match, playing Golf (horribly) and volleying tennis balls.  I wasn't that good at the Baseball, as I couldn't see the ball.  Oh well, at least I can rest easier knowing the ball can't really hit me in the forehead, eye, nose, shoulder, arm, stomach, leg or crotch... yes, CROTCH.

Super Mario Galaxy is a BLAST!  You're controlling Mario on small round planets, sometimes upside down.  You might occasionally find yourself tilting your head sideways.  There is, however, a lot of reading involved, so I have to scoot up and read, then scoot back to play.  Once again, a minor inconvenience when compared to game play.

Tim, Michelle and a few others know I'm a die hard Metroid fan.  The last two games, Metroid Hunters and Metroid Prime 3 have been a struggle for me.  Hunters, because of the REQUIRED dependency on the touchscreen, and the small viewing area, (I understood, when I bought the game, that this/these  might be an issue.) and Prime 3 because  of the new controls.  The hardest part of Prime 3 for me is knowing what to shoot at.  One of the first tasks is to `calibrate your weapons' by aiming at 4 targets.  Unless you're (I am) standing face to face with them, they're hard to target properly.  The Wii remote controls your facing direction.  Your Nunchuck controller thumbstick moves you forward, back, left, right.  The other buttons have various functions.  In my first skirmish with space pirates, I had a hard time making them out from the flashing backgrounds and walls.  A lot of the time, the only way I could target an enemy (I haven't learned how to lock on like you could in Primes 1 and 2.) is see where the purple projectiles were coming from, move toward that spot and fire.  Not good for the health meter.

Do I regret buying the Wii?  Not at all.  I, and other nearsighters just need to understand there will be difficulties to work around.  Otherwise, it's an excellent way to uproot a couch potato and give them a little bit of exercise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_36?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=36&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, I have young kids (7 and 3) and the number of games the Wii offers for kids, compared to the PS3, is unbelievable. If you have young kids and are buying something with them in mind, do them a favor and get the Wii. Of course, the demos for the PS3 wand (you can see on Youtube) make me think that will blow away the Wii. But, with no pricing on the wand available yet, no idea whether they will start marketing more games for the kids or not, I am still thinking the Wii is the best family choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

(by Laura)","September 27, 2009","At a time where the Playstation 3 was too pricey, and the XBOX 360 was too boring, the refreshingly revolutionary Wii came out: and, let me tell you, it's one of the BEST gaming systems out there!  In this review, I will describe the Wii's strongest and weakest points, starting with the stronger:

1.  Revolutionary motion controls.  Though there are a few ""traditional"" games, most of the Wii's games feature controls based on movement (e.g. swinging your arms to throw a punch, or pointing to select an option).  These controls are AWESOME!  They work pretty well, even before the fancier things like Wii Motion Plus and the Wii Balance Board came out (each sold separately).  With motion on your side, this system is also probably the most calorie-burning game system on the market today.  The motion controls make games a MUCH more immersive experience; like you're playing them instead of watching them!  VERY revolutionary indeed!

2.  Easy to set up.  I won't lie: this is the first game system I managed to set up without any parental assistance.  Just make sure that you find the right TV channel that will show the Wii screens (for me, it's Video 2, using the input button; but it probably varies).  Once you get the hang of it, it will only take about ten to fifteen minutes to set up before play, if you choose to take it down.  In other words, the fun starts almost instantly!

3.  FUN games!  Many great games have come out for the Wii since it's release (e.g. ""Sonic Unleashed,"" ""Super Smash Brothers Brawl,"" ""Sonic and the Black Knight,"" ""Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games,"" etcetera; each sold separately).  In fact, ""Wii Sports"" alone is a great game, and it comes WITH the Wii!  Buying a Wii is basically like buying a mine that holds gold; you're going to get a LOT of rich experiences out of it!

4.  Gamecube game compatibility!  All of the great games you can play on Gamecube can be played ON the Wii!  There are some GREAT Gamecube games to boot!  So, if you buy a Wii, you're basically buying TWO great systems at once!  How's that for a deal?

5.  Most inexpensive of the newest systems.  The price has even come down since I bought it!  At the price it is now, it is MORE than remarkable!

6.  Decent graphic capabilities.  I've heard many people complain that the graphics for the Wii games aren't any good; those people obviously haven't played games like ""Sonic Unleashed.""  You buy that game and tell me: do the graphics stink?  NO way!  True, they may not be the VERY best graphics on the market, but that's basically just splitting hairs; the graphics still hold their own, even when compared to the other latest systems.

7.  Fun features!  The Wii is capable of interacting with the internet to allow multiplayer capabilities through online resources, weather updates, shopping, and more!  It can also do stuff with pictures, but I've never explored it; this thing has thousands of features, but, alas, most of it is useless if you don't have Wi-Fi.  Still, if you're internet savvy, this is one of the BEST systems to have!  My favorite non-internet feature is creating the Miis (basically little computer people for some games); it's AWESOME to create an in-game version of yourself, and your family!  That feature alone will keep you entertained for at least a couple of hours!

Well, that's all I can think of on the great features; and, trust me, there are a LOT of good features with this system!  Still, it has it's weaknesses; and, while I don't think they're deal-breakers, each buyer should be aware of the system's limitations:

1.  Questionable durability.  Though I have never tested the durability for myself, the Wii just doesn't feel the strongest; while it may be able to take a hit or two (I don't know; I've never dared to try), I wouldn't throw it on a hard surface, drop it, or hit it in any way shape or form.  Because I don't trust its durability, I never use the stand it comes with (which can make the system stand vertically) prefering, instead, to lay it down horizontally.  At least it won't fall apart the second you touch it, and it doesn't overheat easily if you follow the directions on ventilation (trust me, if it did, mine would be dead by now); but, again, no hard hits.

2.  LOTS of parts.  Unlike a PS3 or an XBOX 360, which probably only come with a remote control and a few wires, the Wii has many parts: a sensor bar (for reading the motions), wireless remote controls (which can easily get lost if kept away from the system itself), and a couple of wires (for audio and visuals) all come with the package.  It's easy to forget items like the sensor bar; and, guess what, without the sensor bar you can't play as the Wii loses the ability to sense motion.  Just something to make note of.

3.  The Wii remote runs on AA batteries, because it is wireless.  This means you'll throw more money down the tubes keeping the Wii remote powered in order to play.  Have some Energizer batteries handy: you'll need them.  Constant play will wear out Wii remote batteries in about two to three days (six to a week if you only play only an hour or two a day).

4.  Synchronizing is needed for multiple controls.  In order to add controllers and, therefore, multiplayer gameplay, you have to do this thing called synchronizing: basically, making it so the system can sense the movement of the remote.  While I've never done it (I'm a mostly single player), the process looks confusing compared to simply plugging in the controller and starting.  Also, speaking of multiplayer, bear in mind that the system itself only comes with ONE Wii remote and ONE Nunchuk; you'll need to buy more remotes and nunchuks separately if you wish to engage in multiplayer.

Conclusion: well, that's that.  The Wii IS oriented on family fun and exercise: so, get your family together and play!  However, if you're mostly a single player (like I am), don't stress: there's a lot of great things for you too!  Overall, the Wii is one of the BEST consoles of the times; and, maybe, the decade!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_185?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=185&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I hadn't tried the Boxing and Baseball games until I got my Wii, and found them to be fun as well. The Boxing in particular will give you a pretty good workout. And that's part of the fun of this game and system--it's very interactive, far more than these types of games on a PC, which I also have. I have tried a few other games on Wii, including driving (Need for Speed) and FPS (Resident Evil), but I find those types of games are better on a PC. The system itself is practically idiot-proof--extremely well thought out design, with superb instructions. I recently purchased Wii Sports Resort and it is even more fun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Timerson","The most FUN system available","January 22, 2007","For the past several years, Nintendo has really been taking a back seat to the video game industry. Boy, how things have changed! With this Wii (and the DS Lite) they really are on top of things now. I dont necessarilly mean the utmost power, but (I think) the utmost fun. I just got a Wii yesterday and I have to tell you that the ENTIRE family had a blast all night! We just played the Wii Sports disc that came with it.. Bowling is a blast, Tennis is great, Golf seemed a little hard (need practice I guess), Baseball isnt bad (its kinda basic) Boxing will make you break into a sweat, LOL There are also a couple more things to do on that same disc. The controller works great, it doesnt take long to get used to. The WiFi was easy to set up with my Linksys wireless router. The Weather Channel is SO handy, as is the ability to leave a message for another family member. A calendar is also included in the menu. Each person can set up and personalize his own ""avatar"" , which is kinda neat. There are so many different things to do with this (including surf the internet if you wish), I really cant say enough good about it. Nintendo has a winner here! I also have an Xbox 360 which is great in its own right, but I have to say that this Wii is more FUN to play, so far... However, initial set-up took a little while because of a couple of system updates and the Internet Channel download (free) This only applies if you hook it up online though. It was all very easy, just a little time consuming:)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_189?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=189&reviewerType=all_reviews"

  The Wii not only gives the typical 14-24 male a chance to have fun, but also Mom, Dad, and Grandma can play and have a blast. With their strategy to 'bring gaming back to the masses,' Nintendo have succeeded significantly. Now, all the family can play on a video game console and really have a good time, which is something not typical of video game machines. But as I have said, Nintendo has a Wiinner!
  It is a good thing that Wii Sports come with the Wii because it trully shows what the machine can do, and it's also a great party game. Get four people together and play a match of tennis or bowling and you are in Nirvana!
  Of course, there are also other great games for the Wii besides Wii Sports, but that is a trifle irrelevant. I'm here to discourse on the Wii itself and its hardware.
  Which brings me to my next point: the graphics. Now, the Wii is not a graphics powerhouse. Some have been audacious enough to call it a Gamecube 1.5. But that is of no matter. For many really don't give a hoot about the quality of the graphics as much as they do about the gameplay. Would you rather look at a georgeous monopoly board or actually play it? I'd go with the latter. How about you?
  The Wii is cheap, fun, and can get the family together. What's not to love?","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_188?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=188&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It is appalling to me that all nintendo wants to do is cater to children. I mean seriously this system has the most potential of any system ever and all they can do is pump more and more mediocre titles on the market. Everything people are saying about the system having to many of the same games and games rehashed from past systems are true statements and will ultimately be the downfall of Nintendo Wii. I'm not even into graphics that much so really I can understand why they did not follow in line with PS3 and Xbox in that category, however, at least the other two companies are trying to create news game franchises. No more heroes is for the wii and I have to admit it is probably in my top 5 favorite games of all time. It is unique in almost every conceivable way, but is this system going to be a one hit wonder in mature games as well as unique and original titles, because it certainly seems that way as of right now! Thats not to say that they can't recover but the system has been out for going on two years now and I've only seen small improvements. Basically if they keep falling behind in the good games race this will essentially be another sega dreamcast. OMG, I really just said that, but I swear to the video game gods it is true. Please Nintendo do something, because I really do not want Xbox to take over the gaming community because we all know that xbox is out for the money and only the money. They do not care about their customers, however I do feel that nintendo cares and would replace anything that tears up within a reasonable amount of time. So, overall the system is the best as far durability and originality, but with increasingly bad games being put on the market I just don't know if it will have a legacy like the nes or even the nintendo 64. Because of the aforementioned I can not recommend this system as of right now, but maybe in the future after you can see what games are available.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It arrived within two days of me ordering it.
The game was neatly packaged.
Very easy to hook up.
Loved that a sports game came with it.
Simple to program.

CONS
Price of the games are way to expensive. (not much to do with the actual console)

I love playing the sports game that came with the console. I'm not much of a outdoors person. So being able to play tennis, baseball, bowling, golf and boxing was great. I loved being able to pretend like I was really playing with another person. The tennis and boxing really make you move and you get a little exercise on the way. It's fun and healthy. Even my 3 year old can play. She loves the boxing. I would recommend this produce to anyone and any age. Wii has so many games and exercise programs. I am looking forward to building to my wii and purchasing all the ""extras"" that come along with the console.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I owned a ps2 before this and intended on getting a ps3.  I still might.  I picked this up because I liked Nintendo's strategy of going into this next generation purely focusing on gameplay.  I have not been had this much fun playing games since the early days of the Commodore.  The controls are intuitive and for once it is a game system designed for the entire family.  The graphics are not on the level of other sytems, but frankly who cares.  I'm interested in gameplay and if that's what your looking for that's what this system delivers.  Just try playing a friends system, you'll want to buy it.  The system comes with a game (a novel concept that for some reason died with the SNES) that really begins to show the potential of what this system is capable of.  I am really looking forward to future games for this system.

I would call it a semi next-gen console because of this. The graphics can be more compared with the GameCube. The only improvement is that the games are in widescreen and a slight improvement in picture quality. Some would say, though, that some of the GameCube games had better graphics. I can see that ini some games made for the Wii. I can say that the Wii has not been a good investment. This console does not have very many good games. I would say that for the limited games put out by first and third party companies, only about 20% are passable. The only game even worth a look is the Zelda Twilight Princess but then that is also available on the GameCube and I already had that. The controllers are what made this console new in a sense. But the use was force implemented in games such as Zelda Skyward Sword. Problems with the controllers were really apparent in games like New Super Mario Brothers Wii where the jumping mechanics were not well implement. I can understand why people complained about the dash. Nintendo realized the problem and put out a new controller to correct some of the problems with the Wiimote Plus. But by then the damage was done. Further, who wants to spend another forty bucks for another controller? I got the console in order to play Zelda Skyward Sword as it was not available for the GameCube as I am a fan of the Zelda series. But after having played that game I can say that it was not worth getting the Wii for. The other games were mot very good. It reminds me of the experience I had with the GameCube where there were lots of bad games. The best games for this console is actually the Wii sport and that can get quite boring without others to share the experience with. If you are getting the Wii for the fitness game, research shows that it is not an effective way to get fit. So that's out the window. Now, this console just sits collecting dust. The only plus is that it does play GameCube games but then I already have a GameCube. If you buy this, you will need to buy the GameCube controllers. I spend most of my time on the Playstation 3. I spend a small portion on the Xbox 360 as it is only for campaigns. I don't play online on Xbox 360 as I refuse to play sixty bucks just to play my games online. I used to subscribe to Xbox Gold but then after comparing online games (I even had Call of Duty World at War for both consoles and saw no difference in graphics or gameplay) I realized that Xbox Gold was a waste of money. As far as online gaming on the Wii goes, it is very archaic. You cannot actually hear what the other players are saying. Of course you can chat with your friend but the system is terrible. To add insult to injury, Nintendo came out with a microphone that they discontinued because it was that bad. That is a far cry from the Sony Playstation 3 headphones which I use for online gaming. If you want to know what it is like to play online with great sound and microphone, the Sony Playstation 3 headphones are simply the best. And don't get me on the code system just to paly with your friends online. That is just simply a pain in the ass to say the least. Further, having played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 online on the Wii, I can say that it lacks the fun of playing it on the Playstation 3.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_215?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=215&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Apart from the green and black screen GameBoy, I have never owne a nintendo system. I grew up with the Commodore 64, Sega Megadrive (Genesis) and Playstation 1.

But after seeing a demo of this in our local store, my wife and I had to have it.

It is so much fun and it doesn't feel like you are being lazy and lounging around the house as I often felt lying in front of the Playstation. I was sore for a week after my first day playing the sports pack.

I would definitely recommend getting the extra controllers and also the Wii Fit Board. They just add to the family fun!

It is not only fun, but also ""healthy"" activity after heavy family meals. Although we do have 5 different game discs, we all always end up playing Sports game and we love it. Best part is to see 56 yr women compete against 13 yr teenager and everyone else enjoying it.

Some other comments: set up was very easy, including wi-fi connection ( we do have Linksys wireless router and recognized it right away), cables in to TV and up go. I love the fact that we could order some Mario games from older versions ( although we have not played it yet) via internet store.

 I am not sure if this is system for high profile gamers, but Wii exceeds all expectations in our house, when looking for gaming system to have fun, be healthy and be appealing to everyone ages 6-66. Thanks to the online store ( accessible from Wii console via wireless router) one can never run out of games to play or can buy different channels for fun and more info.

 I was hard-core PS2 fan, my mom loved her Mario SNES, and after trying PS3 and being amazed by it's graphics and games, I realized that I can, personally, play my kind of games on laptop.Our Samsung TV is already wirelessly/via DNLA set up for media streaming from my computer, so I didn't need media center. Sure, blue-ray DVD player was added benefit of PS3, but ever since we have this system, we barely watch movies, and HD DVD player will be useful for some time.

 This is definitely system for whole family and good entertainment for any gathering. And for those easily bored, internet stores and wide variety of games on disc and accessories, sure are leaving plenty of options to find something new all the time. And plenty of options to give as gift to someone who has everything else (including Wii system).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_211?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=211&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After finally tracking down a console and purchasing one, I now know why it's still so high in demand. The graphics aren't comparable to Xbox 360 or the PS3, but the Wii was never meant to dominate when it comes to graphics. It has dominated, I believe, in how interactive and fun it is to play and in how easy it is to use. It can be used as an exercise regimen or a supplement to one. Nintendo really got down the physics of natural motions and they put out a very intuitive, easy to use, and fun product.

as a current gaming console...there's nothing good to play. zelda and mario galaxy were pretty fun but they lack the depth of comparable titles on the other two systems. This generation of gaming consoles is pretty tricky, but the wii is the most shallow and stripped down of them all. Once the magic of Wii Sports wears off, its pretty much over because there isn't anything you can really immerse yourself in. And its no cheaper than an Xbox (and somewhat compared to ps3) because if you buy controllers to play its smorgasborg of quick multiplayer games you're set back another $[...].","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_258?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=258&reviewerType=all_reviews"

DualIdentity","Great, Except For The Need To Buy More Items","December 12, 2006","The Wii is as great as I was hoping it would be. And the remote/nunchuck controllers are not nearly as unwieldy as I had read in reviews (Safety First! Always remember to attach the controllers to your arm unless you want to throw your remote out the window or through your television). Once you get past being self-conscious about how ridiculous you probably look bowling/golfing/fishing in your living room, it's really a lot of fun (and at least a little more exercise than I was getting playing games where I just sat on my bottom for several hours). The biggest drawback I have found to the whole thing is that once you buy one, you suddenly have a long laundry list of items you need to get to go with it. Aside from any Wii branded games you may want to acquire you will also need several other not initially obvious items to go with it to make it live up to it's potential.

For example to use the internet feature: your best bet is to have a wireless internet router, this obviously also requires you to have some sort of high-speed internet connection. They also have an option to hook it up via a Wi-Fi USB cable, and are eventually supposed to be coming out with a LAN adapter, but since my Wii and my computer are on different floors these last two solutions really aren't an option without some fancy wiring. Once you purchase your modem, don't forget to password protect, or every other Wii in your neighborhood (and possibly someone's laptop computer) will be hijacking your connection as well!

So I finally get online, and there aren't quite as many of the old school games as I was hoping available for download, but I hold out the hope that the selection will expand in time as more people are able to purchase this system. In order to buy these games you first need Wii points. Wii points can be purchased via a physical giftcard you buy at most electronics stores or of course you can virtually buy points via the console using a credit card (however if giving this as a gift you definitely want to consider at least the 2000 point gift card as the later generation games cost about 500 points each).

The only games that can be played with the Wii remote seem to be NES and some Sega Genesis games (basically not anything requiring more than 2 or 3 buttons). All the other games later than that (other than Wii branded titles) require you to use either a Nintendo Gamecube controller or the Wii Classic Controller. But wait, there's more!

It also plays Gamecube games, right? Yes, but you need to save your Gamecube games on a Gamecube memory card, not the memory that comes in the Wii. Also you again can only use a Gamecube controller to play these. My advice unless it really bothers you to play SNES and/or N64 games on the Gamecube controller is to bypass purchasing a Wii Classic Controller altogether, and instead get a decent (preferably wireless) Gamecube controller so you have all your old catalog games covered. Personally I found using the Wii remote to play NES games gave me bad cramps in my left hand, so I will probably use the Gamecube control for everything except the Wii branded games (holding it the normal way doesn't hurt at all).

Lastly, pretty much any game on this system (as with all systems), if you want to play anything with more than one person at a time you will need to buy a second (or third or however many more people you want playing at one time, unless of course you expect your friends and family to BYOC) set of controllers (there is space on the console for up to 4 Gamecube controllers, and I believe the sensor can be synced for up to four Wii remote/nunchuck combos).

Despite all this, it really is a nice system. I would not recommend it as a substitute for someone who really wants a PS3 and/or Xbox360 as this will never be as powerful. Only as an addition to one of those consoles or for families with children who do not play hardware intensive games (like the upcoming Final Fantasy XIII). If you or your family will be content playing movie and television show spinoffs or Zelda/Mario/Starfox/Metroid/Sonic the Hedgehog games then by all means this can be your only system.

My main goal here was hopefully to take out some of the confusion in purchasing this system and making it as enjoyable as possible ""out of the box"". Since I was not aware when I sold my Gamecube that it would have been helpful to keep my accessory package, and now of course have to repurchase all these things over again, I was hoping to assist someone else in learning from my mistake. Hope it was helpful!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_232?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=232&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We got the console back in September and hid it from the kids for an early Christmas present.

The only game we've played so far is the Wii sports that comes with the system.  Granted, the graphics may not be as good as what you will find with the Playstation and XBox, but the time we've spent playing the Wii sports game has been great!  We enjoy the exercise required for the games and I've enjoyed seeing our kids enjoy playing with the game and interacting with each other - much more productive and more conducive to stronger relationships as opposed to just watching the tv!

If you are looking for a system oriented to families, then the Wii is for you.  If you looking for higher-quality graphics and games with more mature themes, then the Playstation or XBox will be better.

We can't wait get to get more games for the Wii and enjoy more hours of quality family entertainment and exercise!

Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_185?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=185&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Once you get over the initial weirdness of telling your friends, ""hey, I'm gonna go play with my Wii for a few hours,"" you're in for a treat indeed.

For one thing, the contraption itself looks like it could have been in, like, Star Trek or something. The main thing sits on this other thing that makes it kind of tilt up, which makes it really easy to put the disks and and also LOOKS INCREDIBLY COOL. It could totally be a sculpture.

So anyway, once you get all of the stuff hooked up, plug in all of the cords and set up the sensor bar thing (which looks a lot less high-tech than it sounds), and start 'er up. When you first turn it on, it brings you too the ""Wii Channel"" page, which includes stuff like the weather channel and the news channel and other stuff that nobody really cares about.

Because you want to PLAY A GAME. That's why you bought the thing, gosh darn it. So grab your Wiimote. Now - get this - POINT IT AT THE SCREEN. No, the other way. There you go. See? You point the thing at the screen to move around the little cursor thing. IS THAT COOL OR WHAT. 'Course, you'll probably need a few hours of practice before you're able to actually control it well enough to actually click the right channel.

The Wiimote can also vibrate and make noise. It is basically a robot.

But yeah, once you got the whole Wiimote thing down (or just use a GameCube controller, if you're against PROGRESS and CHANGE and HOPE FOR THE FUTURE), you can play games such as Super Smash Bros. Brawl (which is pretty much the greatest game of all time), or WiiSports. Which comes - oh my goodness this is amazing - FREE with the system(!).

You can also buy other games that use/require extra cool stuff, like Wii Mario Kart or WiiFit. Sweet.

So yeah, buy a Wii. They are the coolest.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_206?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=206&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I personally was slightly underwhelmed with the system since I've been playing games for awhile now I really thought there would be more to it.  Sometimes the holes in the motion sensing technology are kind of obvious (Wii Sports boxing, I'm looking at you).  I prefer one of the more traditional gaming systems for my gaming needs, but loads of casual gamers will love that the Wii offers simple, nostalgic fun.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_223?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=223&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Grossman","NINTENDO CREATES A REAL BREAKTHROUGH IN GAMING","November 20, 2006","I don't think it is fair to compare the Wii to the more pricey Xbox 360 or the PS 3. There is no question that the graphics in the two latter systems are superior to that of the Wii's. However, what I can tell you from my personal experience of being a Wii owner now for about 36 hours is that after 5 minutes of playing the tennis game that's part of the Wii Sports disc that's included with the console is that THE GRAPHICS REALLY DON'T MATTER! I have found that this NEW INTERACTIVE style of gaming has gotten me so involved in the game and acquiring the skills to improve my rating that the graphics just aren't a factor. This qaming system gets you involved beyond sitting in a chair holding a controller. In fact, the best way to play this tennis game is to STAND UP and pretend your controller is a tennis racket and swing your forehands and backhands just as you would if you were really playing tennis. Of course if you want to just sit there, you can but I'm telling you this game really promotes involvement and immersement like I never dreamed was possible for a video game.

Nintendo has really created a NEW DIMENSION IN GAMING with this interactive style of play. I tried to get a PS3 on launch day and couldn't. I spoke to my 18 year old son who's an incredible gamer and he told me about what he had heard about the soon-to-be-launched Wii. I am really glad I looked into it and bought. I'm sure the other systems are great and in terms of graphics, are far more advanced than the Wii. However, I am very happy with this and I paid less for the system, extra controllers, and three extra games than I would have paid for the PS3 console alone, had I been able to get one.

If you can, for 5 minutes, look beyond the antiquated graphics and see the Wii for what it really is; a new INTERACTIVE GAMING EXPERIENCE and appreciate it for this then you'll conclude that Nintendo has really done much more in terms of breakthrough technology than either Sony or Microsoft. Sony and Microsoft created games that access EXISTING HDTV technology. Nintendo has accomplished far more in that they have seemingly INVENTED A NEW TECHNOLOGY or at least created a gaming system that shows that Nintendo's engineers really ""thought out of the box"" to bring player involvement in the game to a level never before achieved.

Also, from what I understand this system will play all previouisly released Nintendo games...remember Mario Brothers? I haven't tried it but I think that's par of the claim.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_181?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=181&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Before the Wii U Came Out","December 13, 2013","The Wii was Nintendo's seventh generation console that was the competitor of the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360. With the next generation just now releasing, people are probably asking the question ""Is the Wii worth anything now?""

Well, I hate to break it to you, but now that the Wii U is out, it's not really. Like my other console reviews, I'll look at the Wii systematically.

1. Hardware

The Nintendo Wii, though not as powerful as the PS3 or 360, was the most revolutionary of the last generation. The ability to use motion controls was very cool, even if some third-party developers abused this ability. It became even better when Nintendo released the Wii Motion Plus, which allowed for more accuracy in the motions. Other neat features include Miis (virtual characters that are used in games such as Wii Sports) and the Virtual Console (downloadable re-releases of classic games). Unfortunately, the Wii doesn't have downloadable content or very good online functionality. Also, the system doesn't come with a charger for your remotes (which would be very useful). Still, hardware-wise, it's a pretty big improvement over any sixth-generation game console.

2. Graphics

People were disappointed when Nintendo revealed that the Wii wasn't in HD. When comparing most Wii games to most PS3 or 360 games, you can see why. Obviously, being in 480p as opposed to 1080p, it would be harder to make a game look good on the Wii as opposed to the other systems. However, games like Super Mario Galaxy, Sonic Colors, and Super Smash Bros. Brawl show that the Wii can have some pretty great graphics and that HD wasn't exactly necessary. Like I said though, the graphics generally aren't very good, even though Nintendo proves time and time again that they can be pretty great.

3. Power

The Wii's power is about the same as a sixth-generation console, aside from the fact that it can hold downloaded games and things of that nature. Like the graphics, Nintendo shows that it's not necessarily a bad thing. Super Smash Bros. Brawl was packed with more content than most of the PS3 or 360 games I've played.

4. Games

Clearly, Nintendo makes some of the best games. Looking at their score averages, you can see that most of the time, their games are in the 8's to 9's out of 10. However, aside from companies like SEGA (who gave us the awesome Sonic Colors), the Wii had very little third-party support. There was also a lacking of mature games. Most were aimed for kids. Since I can't play very many T or M games, that's not a bad thing to me. However, I can see why older gamers would find the Wii's line-up to be disappointing.

The Verdict

If I wrote this review two years earlier, I would have totally recommended the Wii. However, with the Wii U out, there really isn't any reason to. The graphics are better, the online functionality is better, the power is better, and it can even play Wii games! For those who already own a Wii, don't take this the wrong way. It's a pretty great system. I still have my old one and play it occasionally. The only thing is, with the backwards compatibility of the Wii U, there is no reason to get one now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_173?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=173&reviewerType=all_reviews"

There are plenty of reviews that break down the specs and the like I'm going to look at this from the perspective of my interaction with my step-son, I'm not very happy with alot of the titles he see's at the blockbuster for the ps2 and wants to play since he likes to emulate what he plays and  ends up getting hurt.  So my thought is get a wii and we can play together and keep him more engaged and for the most part I wouldnt have to worry.

I have a 360 and had a ps3 but the wii has been hard to get I recently found one and gave it to my step-son for valentines day.  Set it up for him and as we hadnt bought any games yet we just fired up the Wii-Sports titles and after a very short instruction period on what to do and making his very own Mii >little character that you design to be used in some games< he set out to try out the titles his face would light up every time he would bowl or get the a point in tennis the boxing I thought would be his favorite turned out to be his least favorite. He plays a little bit every day but lately the novelty has been wearing off >that and we have yet to be able to find a second controller since they are harder to find then the Wii< so we picked up Rayman's Raving Rabbids, and he was back into the game getting a workout and I can honestly say that when we visit blockbuster he isnt trying to talk me into Grand Theft Auto or anything its more wii games or even a snowboard game or something a little less violent and a little more mellow.

If you can find a second controller >we borrowed one for a day< you get a whole new experiance with your son/daughter.  We laughed constently because I did look rather goofy playing tennis.  The Wii really does bring a new level of interaction with a person because you can talk you can play the games for the most part are setup so you arent in the hunched over block the world out position and let me play they are more open and sociable.  I am very impressed with the Wii and how its actually helped bring my family a little closer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_194?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=194&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I am now wondering if Nintendo could turn around and win the console war this round despite the higher end graphics offered by the other two.

The biggest advantage that the Wii has is price.  To get the entire console at $250 is amazing!  And I appreciate their simplicity in offering only one console instead of a core system and a higher-end system, something that aggravated me about the other two consoles.

On the innovative side, the Wii comes now with the remote and nunchunk.  I was pretty surprised while playing to learn that the remote actually has a speaker inside.  That is pretty new as well.  But the remote looks like a small TV remote and adds a new level of flexibility to gameplay.  For one, if you point at the screen then it can pretty much function as a mouse.  It can also detect if the remote tilts in one way or the other.  For instance, while bowling if you tilt the remote to the left when releasing the ball then the ball will curve left.  In boxing, if you lean to the right then the body of your boxer leans to the right to dodge a blow from your opponent.  There is a driving game where you can use the remote as a steering wheel.  Again, this is completely innovative on Nintendo's part.

One complaint I have heard about the Wii remote is that it is easy to break once you get into the game.  I can see why.  While playing baseball or golf you swing it like a bat or a club.  Also in baseball you throw it like a baseball while pitching.  Instinct almost kicks in and makes me want to let go of the remote during the pitching part of baseball.

There is a learning curve to the remote as well.  However, the Wii comes with Wii Sports to get you familiar (like how Bill Gates threw in Solitaire into Windows to help learn the mouse).  Wii Sports will not keep you entertained for long because they become quite boring after you master the use of the remote but it does do a good job of getting you over the curve.

The remotes are also in short demand right now and most games seem to have written the use of the remotes into the games as an afterthought (the largest exception being Zelda).  But I think games in the future will be written throughout with the remote and nunchunk in mind and these games are going to be amazing.

The graphics are not as impressive as what you'll see on the XBox360 and the PS3, but the DVD quality is good enough when you are more interested in playing and having fun.  Don't get me wrong, the 1080 resolution is very impressive.  But after you get into a game, the graphic difference becomes irrelevant if you are having fun.  And the Nintendo Wii is a load of fun!!

One last note.  While searching for a Wii I went to many stores (Best Buy, a few WalMarts, Target, several Game Stops and many others).  I noticed that a lot of the XBox360's and PS3's were frozen or out of order.  Very few demo machines actually worked.  But I never once saw a Wii not working though all but once had a classic controller instead of the new remote.  I've read that PS3's can overheat and the XBox360 can crash on occasion (Windows!!  Typical).  So I'm glad that the Wii comes out quite solid.

So, Wii loses in graphic capabilities but wins in price, fun, stability, and innovation.  Choose which is more important to you and then go with that decision.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_184?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=184&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Beginning about October, and definitely by Black Thursday - the Friday shopping day after Thanksgiving, television, newspapers, and every advertising medium were filled with articles and advertisements for the new gaming consoles coming out just in time to put under the Christmas tree.

The gaming console picked to attract the most attention immediately was the PlayStation 3.  It touted the Blu-ray player that was part of the standard equipment, and that Blu-ray player was supposed to be the feature that crushed all other game consoles. Unfortunately, the PlayStation 3 - like its predecessor and the original Xbox and Xbox 360 - was underproduced. Supposedly the problem was in the blue diode chip that enabled the Blu-ray player to work. As a result, there were simply not enough PlayStation 3 units produced to fill every Christmas stocking.

The Xbox 360 came out the Christmas before. It, too, was underproduced and ended up inspiring a whole new generation of campers that took up the sport outside Walmart, Costco's, and other electronic outlet stores around the United States. The price tag of the PlayStation 3 was exorbitant, as was that of the 360 when it first broke.

But the same time Nintendo released its new game system called simply Wii. At $250.00 per unit, buying a Wii seemed like a no-brainer, except that people were getting wooed in by the wowser graphics offered by the PlayStation 3. But the lack of PlayStation 3 units caused a run on the Wii at Christmas that has taken months to level off.

I had been looking for a Wii since before Christmas and finally scored one at a Best Buy in May. My eighteen-year-old and I had been diligently calling the local retail stores trying to nail one down. We even called in favors from some of his friends who worked at those places to find out about incoming shipments. The problem was, those incoming units generally disappeared as soon as they hit the floor.  No one would hold one back. And you couldn't buy one over the Internet. Not even from Amazon.

We got up bright and early on a Sunday morning and hauled butt down to the local Best Buy to grab a unit seconds after it was put out. My wife thought we were crazy. My son and I thought we were mission to rescue the Holy Grail. My nine-year-old came with us.  It was his first time for such foolishness and he had a blast. After we got the unit, we hit the game shelves. Everybody got something.

Of course, Dad got the bill.

At home, we hooked the unit up to the 42-inch television in the living room and proceeded to play. The games were broken out and passed around. Then we chose up lots to see who got to play first. Everybody got to play for a little while. Even when we weren't playing our games, we all sat around watching everyone else play their game. Of course, we made comments on the player's form. Unfriendly comments that beggared gross retribution when our own time came to play.

Admittedly, I felt like an idiot waving the controller around. If someone had been looking through the window, I feel certain that the onlooker would have believed he was tuned into Discovery Channel and was watching a presentation involving tribal rituals and the sacrifice of small animals. There's just no way to look cool while playing a Wii.

The controller is incredibly easy to use. All the new games made for the Wii are already coded to respond to the wireless controller's motions. Button use is even at a minimum so you don't get the sore thumbs you normally get with console systems. Whatever the programming is that allows the motion sensitivity to work with the games is amazing. In addition to the primary wireless controller, there's also another wireless controller that plugs into it called the nunchuk. Using different configurations of these two devices allows for many permutations of movements.

Since we got the Wii right at the end of school, we had time to play on the weekends and often used it as a stress reliever in the evenings.  For the first time a long time, we were all gathered around the television and a gaming console. Over the years we've played board games and card games, but there is nothing like playing video games together or providing moral support during a hard-fought campaign. Every victory is celebrated together, and every defeat is never alone.

The Wii package we got came with a collection of sports games. The collection includes boxing, golf, bowling, tennis, and baseball. We had more fun, and more laughs, playing those games together than we did playing our individual games with support.

I fault the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 for not making more family-oriented games. They just don't bring families together the way Nintendo games always have. Of course, I have to give it up to the graphics that are available on those two games systems. Nothing short of a PC matches up to them.

But the bottom line is while the 360 and the PlayStation 3 look beautiful, they just don't put families together the way the Wii does. Not only is the price tag significantly cheaper, but if you're a family that loves to play games together, the Wii is the best way to go because there are more multi-player games that are age-friendly from parent to child.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_258?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=258&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Netflix is also a perk to having a Wii. I love being able to stream movies and TV shows straight to my TV. It's so convenient, I don't know how I put off getting Netflix for so long.

It's sold millions and has been hard to find for ages, attracting a huge market that was previously untapped.  In that vein, it's certainly a great success for those that have previously found modern gaming too complicated to get into the last 10 years.

However I couldn't rate it 5 stars myself, as my system has been left untouched for quite some time while I spend more time gaming on my XBox 360.  One big issue is the lack of steady games that interest me, and another is that I simply don't find the motion controls all that attractive or fun.  While it's great with a group of friends playing Wii Sports or Smash Bros together, the games that actually make a good use of the motion controls are few and far between.  We have a Wii Fit, and even that hasn't gotten a whole lot of play after the initial month of use.  It's not a bad system, and I understand the appeal for the old and young users that are finding it a revolution in gaming, but for someone that's been playing games for years I feel like there should be more.

On my HDTV, the lack of HD graphics is quickly becoming noticable, and while stylized stuff like No More Heroes or Mario Galaxy is passable and looks good, it doesn't compare favorably to Gears of War or something on the 360.  The lack of good online play is also a problem, as a game of Smash Bros online is a lag fest and practically unplayable.  For many these issues aren't an issue, but they are annoyances for me and my preferences in games leans towards the 360 side.  Still, I can't rate the Wii that low since I know how great it is for other audiences.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The only warning: always use a time to warm up if you don't want to go to the ER inmediately.

Of course, there is a time you can get bored if you don't like those games, if you don't increase your skills or in the case of the addicts to games you break all records and there is nothing else to break.  But for my case, it is ok.  You can get tons of games for the family at fair prices or you can get back to the Game Cube games to remember your previous ones.

If you have more than one kid, I recommend to buy the additional control (the one with Wii sports is a good choice) so you can avoid the usual fight for passing the control at each turn.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_190?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=190&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The motion controls are easy and make the gameplay much more fun. The controler looks retarded, but it makes old games play like new. I can not think of one thing the Wii lacks. It can play Gamecube games, use gamcube conrolers and memory, has online news, weather, and broswer channel, has amazing gameplay seccond to none, the graphics are very good (not as good as ps3 but they are good enough) anyone can play it, you can download classic games from the NES, N64, Sega Dreamcast and more, its cheap, its small, it has wireless internet built in, you can send and recive emails and text messages, and the list goes on and on.

I brought my Wii to a super bowl party and everyone was wanting to play it. Old time gamers, people who never had played video games before, 3 year olds, teens, and 50 year olds alike. The Wii is truly for everyone. After the party atleast 4 people said they wanted to buy a Wii, and where asking me where to get them.

The internet browser is very fast (as good as any computer) and you can play web games using the wii's controler, making them much more fun. You can also watch Youtube and google videos, and basicly anything you can do on a real PC.

Get a Wii! Best videogame system every made.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_218?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=218&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So while the game is fun, it is also a bit sad.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_51?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=51&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was lucky to get a Wii at a local EB Games.(last piece in the shipment)

I gave it to my son as his birthday gift.

The whole family enjoyed it so much.  Buyer satisfaction index is way high!

My whole body ached for 3 days after over 9 hours of play in the first day.

My wife also has not exercised so much in her entire life--the bowling, tennis, baseball.... man, is it fun!

My daughter and son both go to a small Christian academy and they just couldn't stop sharing with their friends how much fun this game is.

I sit behind them and watch them play hour after hour and cheered them when they did well, and encouraged them when defeated.  This game not only burns calories but boosted family cohesion exponentially.

I see so many positive things with the Wii and the sports game included in the system.

If you value family time, this is the thing to get.

It's compact, it's reliable.  After using it for over 9 hours the first day, no problems and not even feeling hot on the unit.  Considering the PS3 and the Xbox 360 (i have the Xbox), all needs some kind of external cooling unit if you play extensively, it gets really hot.

On the downside, even though the Wii remote are very durable and strong, they are a bit too expensive ($40 a piece) and all the stores are still out of stock!

Highly recommended and worthwhile to put a deposit in the store to pre-order it.

Nintendo, way to go!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_207?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=207&reviewerType=all_reviews"

All you can do is pitch or hit and the pitches all turn out to be fast balls.  Everything else is wonderful and I love creating our Mii's they are funny.  Get the extra remote and nunchuck when you get the console because your going to need it for two players and if you want to do boxing.  If you get Mario Kart getting an extra Nintendo wheel is advisable so you can race against other family members.  But the whole sports package is unnecessary to play the games.  I haven't gotten to the skiing or skate boarding games so I'll probably have to buy the board but other than killing you with accessories this system is truly wonderful for people who aren't obsessed with video games and require perfect graphics and realistic gun play.

We're adults, in our 50's and not really gamers other than solitaire on the computer.  I figured it was mostly for kids or that it was too cartoony and it wouldn't get used.  I even left it in the box for 4 days because I thought I might bring it back.  When I finally decided to keep it I put off ""installing"" it because I thought it might be complicated and take a long time.  It was only 3 clearly marked cords to hook to the back of the TV and into the unit, and the sensor into the unit.

Well, it took me about 5 minutes to hook it up (It would have taken 3 but I had to crawl around back of the TV stand) and as soon as we started it up I could see it was something we were going to like.  Bowling was the first thing I tried and couldn't believe how realistic it was.  I even have the same hook on the ball that I do in real life.  After that it was tennis, then baseball, then golf and boxing.  I was surprised at how much exercise the tennis and boxing provided.  It was definitely a fun thing to play with.

Two nights later we had friends over, 12 people in all and the people from across the street wanted to see the Wii.  I put on the bowling game, got 4 volunteers to play and that was it for the night. Everyone was screaming when someone got a spare or a strike and they went on to play tennis, baseball, golf and boxing. Fortunately dinner was stuff that could be served buffet style because everyone was gathered around the TV watching or playing the games, with plates their laps or at the kitchen table which has a clear view of the family room.  Two of the people ended up buying Wii's the following week.

I'm mostly into it for the exercise aspect and we've gotten the Wii Fit and the Outdoor Challenge which are both great.  But there are lots more games that ""get you up off the couch"" coming out and now having tried a few, I can't wait to get them.

Daneker","Limited games, low definition, unique control.","August 15, 2007","It's been more than 2 years and I finally walked into a store that had the Wii in stock, when I had enough cash. I remember back when it was first released going weekly to get one and leaving empty handed until I gave up, bought a PS3.

So, what does a Wii do and is it worth it?

Well, as you most likely know the Wii has taken motion sensor to the next level, meaning you can't play a Wii game sitting still. That's okay, playing Zelda there's a certain satisfaction in swinging your arm and hitting something on the screen, it's also hard after two or three hours of questing to keep feeling like doing it.

I have three made-for-Wii games, Zelda, Fit & Sports. So far I enjoy all three (I have Metroid on the way) but we have limited room, so it's not always easy to play.

Originally I wanted The Twilight Princess because I've been addicted to Zelda since the first game on the NES when I was in Jr. High School. I could have played on GC but I have a 42"" Widescreen and playing the 4:3 Game Cube version just wasn't satisfying on the big screen.

I really like Twilight Princess, however, other than the Widescreen output I can't suggest the the Wii version is better than the GC, the graphics are only marginally clearer (I played the GC and Wii version on the Wii, which makes them both 16:9 and from 10 feet back they looked nearly identical.) Except, I actaully find the Wii version less challenging, swinging the controler is more responsive than button mashing, but you only swing it an inch or so, and it can wear on your arm over the hours most of us would play a game like this, even with breaks.

Wii Sports looks like Super Nintendo graphics, it's that bad. The games are marginally fun, but repetitive, it's like playing demos at a trade show. The kids like them, but they do not have long lasting interest.

Wii Fit is the real gem. The games are challenging, the graphics not much better than Wii Sports, but they are addicting challenges and after 30 - 40 minutes of really trying you get a decent stretch and resistance workout - but not hard and fast. It's a good tone and slowburn workout, it's engaging and it keeps you moving and balancing.

And that's the three main uses of the Wii, albeit the adventure game side is lacking, most of the available games are excersise, sports and childrens.

The graphics are only 480p, which is sad. The XBox 360 is not hi-def, but it does offer HD resolution output and HDMI on the high-end model. Having a PS3 for a year, the Wii is like a technology downstep. You can't compare the Wii graphics to games like Eternal Sonata or Uncharted. Plus, since I and many others now use an HDMI switch for all our Video/Audio, it's a pain to have to have the extra wires and switching. The only time I have to change the input on my TV is for the Wii, all my other componets are HDMI through my reciever.

The sound is not dolby surround, not 5.1! That's equivelant to a Laser Disk from 20 years ago, it's the same as the GC and you can only use analog RCA output, no otpical or coax.

The Wii comes with a composite video (1 yellow jack) that only supports 480i @ 4:3 aspect -- that's really bad! You have to but a component (EGB) cable seperate for $10 - $30 to get 480p 16:9, I was really made when I got home and realized I had not progresive output or widescreen.

There are pros:

The Wii outputs any progressive scan GC game in 16:9, so you have the Zeda Bonus disk? Play the first Zelda in Widescreen! I have to admit, Ocarena of Time & Windwaker never looked better! I tried every GC disk I have and they all played at 16:9 or 16:10 and looked and sounded better than the GC.

Also you can download games from Nintendo from all previous systems but GC, including Saturn and Turbo Graphics 16 for $5 to $15 and save them to an SD card. However, you can only put up to a 2 gig SD card in because it doesn't handle SDHC.

The next Wii will most likely be the one to buy. Hopefully, since it's unlikely Sony will licence Blu-Ray to Nintendo or Microsoft the next gen consoles will use Toshiba's HD-DVD for extra disk space and Wii-II will have 1080p output via HDMI with 5.1 LPCM sound -- like PS3 does already.

Sure, the price is better than PS3 @ $250, it's the same as low-end XBox 360, but the games available don't include Action-Adventure or RPG (you have a total of 5 titles in 2+ years in those catagories) but it gives your GC library a facelift, offers the Wii Fit (an extra $100) and will entertain the kids. But the graphics are 5 years dated, the sound mediocre and the controller doesn't even come with a rechargable battery!

All in all the Wii is one of a kind, but it's severly flawed and you have to ask yourself, what do I want it for and will I get real play and use from it. You also have to remember that an extra set of controllers will cost $60.00, Wii Fit will cost $100 and those Rock-Band instruments are expensive as well. there's no Hard Drive option and the most memory you can add to save downloaded games is 2 gigs.

I like the Wii, but I don't love it. I'm only a casual gammer, a hard-core would likely laugh at it. It's good for a family if you have the money for extra controlers (3 complete controlers plus batteries and chargers will run $200 easy!!!) It has wireless networking but no MMOG's and for RPG fans it's a bust! It won't look great on a TV over 32"" and will look decent to terrible on a 50+"" set. There's no digital out, at all! And out of the box it only sets up at 480i @ 4:3 resolution.

It's high-tech control, low-tech gaming. Not for everyone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_177?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=177&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It appeals to people of all ages and genders. I am not a video game type of person but the Wii is so much fun. It gets you up and moving and really lets you interact with the game. It is a totally new level of gaming. I am 22 and love it. I have had my dad, who HATES video games because he thinks that are expensive, addicting and make you lazy, play it and he LOVED it! Almost to the point where he wanted to buy one! But he doesn't have the time. I had my aunts and mother play it as well, all of which who are completely technology illiterate! They enjoyed it a lot. There is a large variety of games, so there is something that will appeal to everyone. Sure, the graphics aren't the greatest, but that was not Nintendo's focus with this game console. The only downside is that so far there are not any games available (not yet released. they are coming soon!) for online play. There will be, but I do not think that it will be to the extent of the XBOX 360. However, nintendo's online play is FREE! It is an inexpensive game system and is sure to intrigue EVERYONE!! I reccomend Super Paper Mario, Mario Party 8, and of course, Wii Sports (which comes with it which is awesome...no other gaming console comes with a game!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_189?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=189&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I usually play Madden '09 online while biking on a stationary bike, and playing the video game kept me motivated to exercise.
 I first heard about the Wii Fit months ago and was very interested in the exergaming genre. WOW! The Wii Fit was a fun way to work out, and kept me motivated. Next, I purchased Gold's Gym Cardio Workout. WOW! I was sore all the time, and my arms look more muscular. Finally, I purchased EA Sports Active. I've been training on a consistent basis, and I must say I'm getting a great workout. I canceled my membership at the gym, and don't have to leave the house and fight traffic. The Wii as a fitness tool really delivers.
As for the games, that's why I own a PS3. Wii games are mostly geared towards families, and I can say that their games are very responsibly made. As a veteran, I wouldn't want my child playing PS3 war games, because the bottom line is that war isn't pretty. Adolescents shouldn't be exposed to this glorified violence. Kudos for Nintendo for providing an activity to bring a fun activity families can enjoy together.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've been a gamer for 25+ years.  I like all sorts of games.  The Wii is by far the best console for family games ever made.  My son and I can find plenty of games to agree on - the Lego games are fantastic co-op play for 2 people - and we can find things that my wife and daughter even want to play on occasion.

I'll say this - there are plenty of ""hardcore"" gamers, including much of the gaming press, who dismiss the Wii because the graphics are less sophisticated.  Yes, it's underpowered, but graphics do not make a game.  Plus there is a ton of that Nintendo Magic to be found - Mario Galaxy 1 & 2 (any of the Mario games, really), the Zelda games, Mario Kart, Metroid, etc.  Lots and lots of great stuff.  And plenty of 3rd party supports.  Just read reviews or rent before you buy.  There is a ton of shovel-ware - but that's true of all systems.

And here's something else I love - games on actual game discs.  The Xbox 360 and PS3 do have game discs, but they also have a lot of downloadable content (including bug fixes - ugh), which means that you're paying $60 for the game plus...how much more?  I like things to be simple - sell me a game and don't try to nickle and dime me.  I'm not interested.  This is of course an oversimplification of things, but it's how videogames are going - soon it will be the nonsense like Diablo III where you can't even play the single player game without logging into the publisher's servers.

But I digress.  We've had our Wii for 3-4 years now, and we still have fun with it.  It's one of my favorite systems ever (my favorite being Sega Dreamcast), the motion controls are cool when they're utilized properly by developers (Pro Evolution Soccer on Wii is probably the greatest sports game ever made).  The way I see it, Wii is all about fun and less about trying to impress people with fancy window dressing that ultimately doesn't mean anything.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_187?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=187&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Alongside that it has great mini game collections, fun kid's games, and excellent updates of all your favorite classics (Mario, Zelda, and Metroid).  I think the Wii is the best advancement in video games in well over a decade and I have been playing since Pong came out.

FUN, FUN FUN!","December 30, 2006","We purchased both a Wii and an Xbox 360 for Christmas 2006.  In the last 3 weeks, we have played with the Xbox for a total of 30 minutes, but have played with the Wii almost every night.  The Xbox has very impressive graphics, but the Wii is pure FUN, which is what videogaming is supposed to be about.

A wide variety of people have played our Wii (particularly Wii Sports), with ages varying from 4 to 71 years.  All are amazed by the natural game play.  At a recent dinner party, all of the people that played the game (three) resolved to buy a Wii.

Pluses:

* Conventional controllers cause sore thumbs, carpal tunnel or other repetitive strain injuries.  The games on the Wii rely more on whole arm or whole body movements.  A game of Wii Tennis can actually raise a sweat!

* It is easier and more natural to learn Wii-mote control gestures than learning button combinations on a conventional controller.  You play golf, for example, by swinging an imaginary club--the buttons are used to select a club or adjust the direction of swing for wind and course conditions.

* The console is tiny (~950 cc, about the size of 3 stacked DVD cases) and fits unobtrusively next to our TV.  The Xbox 360 (6600 cc) and PS3 (8700 cc) are far larger (source: [...]

Minuses:

* You can get so caught up in play that you will backhand your partner during a game of tennis.  Be careful!

Suggestions:

* You WILL want 2 or more Wii-motes immediately.  This is a console that the entire family will want to use.

* You will want to check out Nintendo's latest chapter in the Zelda series:  ""The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess""","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_184?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=184&reviewerType=all_reviews"

You can download the Opera browser and surf the web and there is even a way to message other Wii users using a unique serial number.  The remote might take some getting used to, but my fifty year old mother in law who bowled for twenty years in a league jumped right in to the virtual bowling game a rolled a 150 on her first try.  My five year old niece also picked it up pretty quickly.  There's no question that this is totally worth it, I just wish I had gotten one sooner!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_196?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=196&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, the underdog in the console wars has emerged as the victor. I thought that I was somebody who would camp out for days to get a PS3. But, as more information on the wii was released, i changed my mind about what my next-gen console was going to be.

First of all, lets compare the wii to the other consoles, the XBOX 360 and the PS3. The Wii costs $250.00, compared to XBOX 360s which start at $300.00 and PS3s which start at $500.00. The Wii also is the only one to rely more on motion sensing then button pressing. Although the PS3 also has motion sensing, I think it was just added as an afterthought. The Wii is also the smallest of the three, being about the size of three DVD cases stacked on top of eachother.

The Wii remote is an unusual shape for a controller. But, the wii is an unusual game console. The Remote is perfect for pointing at the screen, and a lot of games use this. (e.g. elebits) Also, the wii remote has its own speaker, which never fails to surprise me every time I connect the remote.

The Wii also has some extra features other than just gameplay. From the Wii, you can edit photos from your SD memory card, buy and download games from the NES, N64, Sega Genesis, and the TurboGrafx16, check the weather forecast and local news, and surf the web. And there is probably more to come!

The Wii is also backward compatible with any gamecube games and most of the peripherals, but not the gameboy player :(. There is a deattachable cover on the top of the console if you have it vertically, it's on the left side if your wii is horizontal, that covers 4 gamecube controller ports and 2 gamecube memory card ports. Unfortunately, you need a gamecube memory card to save data from gamecube games.

Overall, the wii is way better than the XBOX 360 and the PS3, and you should do everything you can to get it (But don't be too extreme: one woman actually died trying to get a wii)

Richko","Yes..i actually played with this system... its meger at best","May 3, 2007","OK, first off  Im an Old school gamer and i know people that work in the industry  ...i started gaming with the Atari 2600 and ive been having a blast since then!

i still play with my NES, snes, gamecube, n64, sega systems, playstations, xboxes, colecovision, turbo grafx 16, neo geo, amoung others...even imports so i know what im talking about here..

i like Nintendo..its a great gaming company and they have always had awesome systems and 3rd party games that really shined...when i think of playing nintendo  its mostly on the nes or snes (classics never go out of style..in fact some of them are more fun to play even today!  i know im not alone on this one)

when the Wii came out  like everybody i was looking forward to see what was Nintendo's next gen system like.. but when i saw the gameplay using that weird controller IT WAS A REAL LETDOWN..now im not hating or anything here, but motion usage in video games dont really work...remember the power pad, the power glove etc? even some on some wii games  this tech dosent really work...  yep this is one system that will sit in your closet collecting dust..thats where mine is  and will be for a long time i bet.

 i gave the wii a chance, and well  it didnt feel like nintendo.  first off the system was rushed to  be released to compete with the Xbox 360 and the playstation 3..both systems which  are FAR MORE SUPERIOR in hardware and processing ..which gives stellar graphics. the wii's graphics are lackluster at best...think of a dressed up gamecube...nothing really eye poping when you think of next gen systems...

 lets talk about games...you want to play a campaign with master chief, or call of duty modern warfare?  well you find these games on the wii...but you'll find almost every nintendo  child friendly remake.. super mario wii?  give me a break..how about making a new character or something?  mario was cool  but is played out you look at the wii section  90 percent of the games are aimed at small children..minus some of the cross platform games .

 for games on the wii  they are mostly dumbed down to compensate for that weird controller again  and the short attention spans of the player..  the wii is a system thats  a party system to be dragged out when  people come over...its Not a real gaming system...i know the fanboys will likely rip into this  but hey,  have you looked at yourselves..waving a controller around  playing games like animal crossing? (giggles here)

the online system for the wii is a JOKE  it cant compare to  xbox live or the ps network..  the whole virtual console is a good idea, but for gamers like me that have our original games and systems still..this is not making the wii stand out.
  when i tried the online system for nintendo..it was so lackluster and bland..

You can tell this system was  developed with the soccer moms and familys in mind...thats why its so cheap..that gimmick worked for them in the beginning but now all systems have price cuts..if you want an awesome system..get a ps3 or a 360  heck, even a gamecube  that still is  a great system!  see Nintendo used to make great systems...

where i work, if i get somebody looking for a great system  i tell them about all 3  and most  skip on the wii.

Hopefully, the next system from nintendo will be worthy of their name..and the wii left in the dust.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_193?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=193&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was just very dissapointed with the console. Some of the games are fun, but in all honestly, most of the games that you use the motion controlls for would be 'more fun' to play with a traditional controller.  The other issue I have is with the Graphics. We know they aren't High definition...but it seems some of the games the graphics are even worse than on the original Xbox back 6-7 years ago. Graphics aren't everything, but when you are paying $200 for a console and $40-$50 for a game, I expected soemthing a little better to look at than what the Wii delivers.  If you have an old fashioned, non-HD tv, you can get by with the Wii. However, if you have a big screen, High-Definition Television, the games might actually look bad and you would be much better off with an Xbox 360 or PS3 (we have all 3 consoles, my personal favorite is the Xbox 360, because it is high def, and there are a good choice of games for the kids on there, as well as older games for about $20).","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_154?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=154&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So today I'd like to share my thoughts on the Wii system. My girlfriend and I made the purchase a couple of years ago as an alternative to going out to celebrate the New Year. Right off the bat we had fun just trying to track down and buy the product, as this was still around the holiday period where everyone just had to have it, lol. We actually grabbed the last one in Wal-Mart and have enjoyed it intermittently ever since. The majority of the payment for the device was done via gift cards we had obtained, so I did not feel as hesitant to drop money on a console which I knew was not going to be able to offer me the games I typically play. Today, I would not hesitate to recommend the system at all, as a $150.00 price point is awfully appealing for the amount of fun it can bring to your living room.

What I have found though, is that the Wii system is not necessarily meant to be used by just one person at a time. It is definitely more fun with two or more people and the early Nintendo commercials with the tagline ""Wii can play together"" really hit the nail on the head, so to speak. Currently, my girlfriend and I enjoy playing LEGO BATMAN (WII),Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Wii Play with Wii Remote,Wii Sports, and Mario Kart Wii with Wii Wheel.

We considered the Wii Play and Mario Kart games as value purchases as not only did they allow us to grab games we could play together, they also came with a secondary controller as well as a Wii wheel. Of course, the Wii Wheel is not a necessity but it does enhance the overall experience a bit.

At times however, I have found myself looking to explore the single player games that the Wii has to offer and have just purchased The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (Nintendo Selects). Once I have a few hours under my belt I will be posting a review. In the meantime, we have continued to explore the Wii Shop Channel, giving you access to vintage games found on the SNES, N64, and beyond. We have also used the built-in Opera Web Browser, headline news feature, and weather forecaster. All simple to use but help to enhance the value of the console.

For those who might have an old Gamecube lying around, don't throw it out! All those games are backwards compatible on most systems, and it is nice to see that the Wii has wi-fi built in, a feature that the original Xbox 360 failed to include.

For now I would like to conclude by saying that the Wii offers fun for those who are with a friend, enough extra features like Netflix and a built in web browser to keep it competitive amongst your other entertainment devices, and lower priced games that make purchasing a little more guilt free.

If you are looking for a good way to hang out with the kids or a way to create some laughs on those rainy days at the beach house/ hotel room the Wii deserves your consideration. Please feel free to leave a comment with any additional questions or if you need assistance in making accessory or gaming recommendations.

Thanks,
Sean","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_186?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=186&reviewerType=all_reviews"

One caveat- be careful where you swing the remote, I accidentally boxed my boxer in the snout when bowling.

I actually downloaded a Wii for my sims in The Sims 2 because it seemed so exciting. My Playstation 3 just seems so big and bulky compared to the small and sleek design of the Wii. It looks great with any furniture set and it doesn't waste that much room either. It's not even complicated to set up and if you think so, the instruction booklet explains everything you have to do to set up your Wii thoroughly. Now I'll start with explaining the features of the Wii:
1)Motion-sensing adds a whole new experience for casual gamers and hardcore gamers alike. You can put your Wii remote in anything-a baseball bat, a golf club, a tennis racket, a steering wheel, a gun, you name it. And if you don't like the feel of moving the Wii remote every which way and you'd rather keep it classic, you can just get the Wii classic controller and a grip so you can play classic games like Super Mario Bros. easily.
2) There's a whole new genre of gaming with the Wii with motion and other accessories. In Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10, you can swing the golf club as if you would in real golf. In Punch-Out, you can box by smacking the Wii remote into the air to put some serious blows into your opponent. In Jenga, you actually have to pull the blocks out by moving the Wii remote cautiously as to not knock the tower down. In MarioKart Wii, you steer your Wii remote onto a race track to go for first place. In House of the Dead 2 and 3 Return, aim your Wii remote at the TV and destroy zombies. In The Conduit, you can use Wii Speak to speak to other players during gameplay. There are a bunch of possibilities on the Wii.
3) The fact that you can play Gamecube games on the Wii would want to make you sell your Gamecube for some good money and keep the games for entertainment on the Wii. The Gamecube games are played as they would be played on the Gamecube with no special differences. For people who didn't own the Gamecube previously, this is a good chance for you to go out and get some good titles that you missed like Luigi's Mansion, Mario Golf, Chibi-Robo, Zelda Four Swords Adventures, Sonic Adventure 2 Battle, Zelda Wind Waker, Smash Bros. Melee, Double Dash, Paper Mario, Resident Evil 1 and 2, Pikmin, King of Fighters 98, Animal Crossing and many more. All you have to do is plug your Gamecube controllers into the Wii, put in a memory card, put in you Gamecube disc, and start playing!
4) Next-generation Nintendo games can not be played on any other system. Play games like Animal Crossing City Folk, Metroid Other M, Harvest Moon Tree of Tranquility, New Super Mario Bros. Wii, and many more.
5) The Mii Channel allows you to make and customize people to represent you in games. Some games like Sonic and Mario at the Olympic Games and Mario Super Sluggers allow you to use the Mii's in actual gameplay. And in games like Smackdown vs Raw, the Mii's just represent you. There is no limit to how many you make.
6) Wii Shop Channel allow you to get games like Super Mario Bros., Super Mario 64, Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Mario Kart 64, Donkey Kong Country, Sonic the Hedgehog, and many other games for people that haven't owned Nintendo 64s, Super Nintendo Entertainment Systems, Nintendo Entertainment Systems, Sega Genesis's and even Sega Game Gears. You can get these games for a decent price without having to pay for shipping. You can also buy new channels like a channel where you can access the Internet at any time.
7) Other channels like Forecast Channel and News Channel allow you to do other things. The Photo Channel allows you to view photos. The Check Mii Out Channel allows you to look at other peoples' Miis. The Forecast Channel allows you to see the forecast from all around the world, whether it be the five-day forecast or just the current temperature, you can even see what it's like in Antarctica and Tokyo. The News Channel allows you to see news from all around the world instead of having to tune in to news channels on your TV.
8) The Home Brew Channel allows you to do many cheats in games. In Sonic and Mario at the Olympic Games, you can play as a Goomba, Jet the Hawk, Silver the Hedgehog, and other scrapped characters. All you need is Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess and a manual on how to get the Home Brew Channel and you're all set.
9) Wi-fi allows you to play your video games with people around the world easily.
10) Wii Sports is a fun and enjoyable game for beginners with the Wii. You can play golf, boxing, bowling, baseball, and tennis. It's very entertaining.
That's most of the Wii's features. You have to have the Wii-you wouldn't regret buying it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_174?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=174&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Wii Sports package on 12/3/09. We are both loving it. Its fun, entertaining, and you work up a sweat. If you bother to read the 1 stars, they are just idiots. This system was not meant to be put up against X-Box 360 or the PS3. If they have done their research, they would of known better. I also own the PS3 and strictly use it for blu-ray movies and few games.

As for the Nintendo Wii. It is fun, fun, fun. The package I purchased came with Wii sports which include Tennis, Boxing, Bowling, Golf, Baseball. And Mario Super Sluggers,  with an extra controller and nun-chuck.

The resolution on the system is 480i/480p. (not a high def unit)
Does not play Blu-Rays nor DVDs. (again, not going up against X-Box / PS3)
Unit is very small and comes with a vertical stand.
Small sensor bar that either placed above or below the tv, to read the controllers.
A/V composite cables, (red,white,yellow)
plug in adapter

My advice, check out the other reviews, and research. This system is meant to have fun. For all ages. My wife has rheumatoid arthritis, and she can use this.

We played it as soon as the boys got home. It is worth every penny. It was easy to set up and we had no problems with setting up the sensor bar. Batteries did come with the remote, but I would buy new ones. The Wii Sports game is very cool. The remote felt a little weird, but we worked it out. I loved the fact that you can do so many different moves with your body to accomodiate the characters on the screen. I do not agree with this being a one star item , but hey I'm just a big kid anyway what do I know.

I haven't been drawn in as much as many by the motion controller. Often while playing using the controller hurts my wrists. Especially when using any of the First Person Shooter games. That's really my only complaint.

I hugely enjoy playing Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Super Mario Wii, and Twilight Princess on this console and would recommend those to others.

It's not just a basic kids gaming system,it has adult games too like Sims 3 and more.
I love playing Wii Sports Resort and Alien Crush Returns as well as Wii Music and Sims 2 Pets!
I have a few Gamecube games that work too.
Another cool thing on Wii is that you can both use it to send basic emails to friends and family and surf the web basically with it.
I do this at times when my computer or Google tv are off.
Lastly,you can download old games and new ones from Wiiware for under $50! I have  Dr.Mario Online RX,Mario Bros,and Donkey Kong Country 2. And let me tell you,there is a haxie even that once installed on some older Wii systems,will let you play your DVD movies! I have this installed and it works! I can watch most DVD's with my old Wii.
So although it may say just games,it also plays movies on Netflix and Hulu Plus too now. It's a great system to me.

We are both over 45 years old and our daughter is going to get us a wii fit for Xmas. We also bought a Chrysler Classic Racing game for the wii, it too is pretty much fun. the bowling and tennis on the sports game that is included is a great game.  I do not really care for the wii play game we bought.  it is more for very young children, so if you have young children it would be ok.

The Wii itself is a great product, but is on the $$$$$$$ high dollar side but since we do not go out much this is our "" Night Out ""

I have told our friends about it and they are going to come over and play a bowling match...","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I enjoy the activities with Wii Sports and Wii Play. I like the competition with my able-bodied family members as we each tabulate our Wii Age each day.
It even has a sense of humor. It calculated my Wii Age at 20 years (the best score possible) and I hooted so loudly. But, then there was movement on the screen and I noticed that my age was rocking back and forth. Then it fell off and I was really just 35 years old. This game console was trash-talking me!

The wii is perfect for my family. My six year old can play all of the included sports games -- and can win against older kids and adults so it keeps her engaged. Plus we have a couple of new singing games (Disney Sing It and HS Musical) that are ideal too.

My ten year old loves the sports games, but also enjoys the Star Wars and Bash games. The resolution and gaming is not an issue -- the Star Wars games look great and play great.

Then again, it's not a knock against the games or platform if I consider this to be a proxy review. He probably simply is not interested in video games.  If you're a casual gamer or a senior that needs to do something that involves some activity with fun to boot (YMMV), then it's a good platform. But with Kinect and Move, I'm not sure how it stacks up.

The Wii Fitness and fitness related games were one advantage of the Wii platform. If they still are (given the games), then it might still be a good buy.

Now let's get into the meat of this console straight off the bat you have the Wii Menu which is the equivalent to the main menu of the Xbox Dashboard/home menu of the PS3. The entire menu is sensor based meaning that in order to navigate through the menus and what not you need to use the motion sensory mechanism to select say, what disc you have in the ""tray"" right now. However don't get too comfortable with the motion scheme of the menus as I said before the fact of having this kind of technology is widely ignored to gaming companies alike, few games take advantage of this, namely Mario Galaxy and Super Paper Mario for that matter.
Speaking of controls let's take a look at the controller itself, unlike all of the game controllers in any system this is a weird specimen that people refer to as the Wii Remote or Wii Mote, it has the look and almost the feel of an ordinary TV remote. Unlike most if not all next gen consoles starting from the Playstation era there's something missing to it, you have your basic D-pad, your A button, a 1 and a 2 button, a B button which is on the bottom of the Wii Mote for some odd reason, a plus and a minus button followed by your average home button. With very little buttons you notice that there is no analog stick something that is needed in a controller for 3D gaming since the N64 era, that's when the Nunchuck comes into play.
The Nunchuck is basically your analog stick, why did Nintendo do this is anyone's guess perhaps they forgot to add the analog stick while developing the Wii Mote? I don't know but this is it, it also comes with two extra shoulder buttons, a C button and a Z button. Now I know that the remote does in fact have very little buttons on it and game developers have to keep in mind about that too.
I did look at the one star reviews for this and just as I suspected they have very little reasons as to why this console may suck as much, for one, the games, let's take a look at some of their games shall we.

The games are for the most part, movie/TV show related, ever wondered what it would be like if The Big Bang Theory had a game? Well it's probably for the Wii. There are such classics for the system and I can name them all off the top of my head but I won't bore you with that but let's just say that it's mostly Nintendo related games if not all. The only thing I will gripe about is the misleading on the store page but these are nitpicks so I won't add them to the final score.
On the product page here on Amazon it has a picture of the Wii itself at it's finest when it came out eight years ago, the stand the look everything here is where it got me. In the product description it says that it comes with the Wii Sports game which I was planning on using just to get used to the motion controls and it's backwards compatible. This is not the case, all of that was a big fat lie just like the promise of having cake in Portal 1, the console I got was not backwards compatible and it did not come with the Wii Sports game, but if you might notice is that with the updated versions regardless of their color, they have a GameCube game disc icon when you enter the area for the ""disc tray"" when in fact it's not backwards compatible, guess they forgot to edit that out, for that a lot of people consider that to be trolling. But I didn't really need that backwards thing I wanted that just to have a back up thing in case my GameCube goes out of whack for some odd reason and as for the game well I bought four Wii classics and all have arrived before the console came to my house so I had no need to worry about not being able to play any games at that time but hey, a Wii's a Wii. Like I said these are just nitpicks and I will not count them to the final score.

So with that I think it's time to reveal the final score and give a summary overall of what has been said, for this console I'll give it a 10 out of 10, it has motion controls that need to be paid attention to and not just this ones sake but the PS3 as well or gaming console that involves motion controls for that matter and the button scheme probably could have been thought out more just to add one or two more buttons to it as well as a second analog stick. The games... well I'll let you decide on that one but don't give your hopes up for anything that involves HD graphics I mean, you look at this thing and you tell me that this thing is compatible enough to run something like Call of Duty or God of War, if you really look at it between this one and the Xbox/PS3 does it look like it can run something like that on here? Anyways this thing is amazing and I have been playing with it ever since it came to my house, and you might notice that I haven't talked about the internet, the Nintendo Wii does come with Wi-Fi but I can't access it because my main computer's screen is broken so I can't get the routers WEP key to make it work like that but it's your ticket to accessing a lot of downloadable content which is the equivalent to the PSN or Playstation Network so nothing too special there. With that said if you are planning on buying one for your first time I'm certain that it will be an enjoyable experience with you as it did with me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But never played it or even really had the urge to. But being home so much, and having nothing to do I figured it might be a good idea to have something to do, and I heard it keeps you from being a couch potato, which I am.

So I was on the search for a wii, got one the next day.
SO GLAD I DID!
I haven't slept in one day since I got it, and no one can honestly call me a couch potato anymore.
I play for hours and hours, and I believe it's worth way more than it's out for, no wonder why they are so hard to get!
Plus, my whole family loves to play, while we are playing we aren't arguing, just having tons of fun, and always on the search for more games.

The wireless controllers are really handy.

If you can get your hands on one, do it.

Pros:

 - This system encourages everyone to play because it is fun and easy to pick up, even for non-gamers. The games are catchy and entertaining for everyone. If you are a parent (I'm not, I'm a college student) most of the games are appropriate for children. Nintendo games are generally much more kid-friendly if you're worried about ESRB ratings. This doesn't apply to all of them (I wouldn't recommend Red Steel for a 5-year-old), so just check the ratings. However, you will find that many of the games are rated E.

 - It comes with a game already, and it is a darn fun one. Wii Sports is worth playing for hours and hours and is a fun party game. It isn't just some throw-in to try to make the console look more appealing. You do need a nunchuck for Boxing, so if you want 2-player boxing you have to buy another nunchuck and controller. However, the rest of the Wii Sports games just use the wii-mote.

 - Each person can make a ""Mii"" on their console - A little character that you can make to look just like you! It appears that you can create unlimited Miis and mark one as the ""favorite"". You use your Mii in Wii Sports, and according to the directions your Mii may appear online and in other games as well. They are very detailed and fun to make.

 - There are great online functions, like being able to play games with others online, having a ""Mii Parade"", and even checking the weather!

 - You can store pictures on your Wii with an SD memory card.

 - The Wii has slots for gamecube games, 4 controllers, and 2 gamecube memory cards on a covered panel on the top of the console, so you can play gamecube games.

 - The games are priced at $50 on release, unlike the $60 Xbox 360 and PS3 games. The console is also value priced much lower than these other consoles and is in much better supply (although since it just came out, you will have trouble finding one initially).

 - The current games are great, and there is an awesome list of games coming out. Notable current ones include The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (also on Gamecube), Wii Sports, Trauma Center: Second Opinion, Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz, and Red Steel. There are also some sports and first-person shooter games for it, mostly interactive. Some notable games coming out later are Elebits (12/15/06), Wario Ware: Smooth Moves (1/15/07), Smash Bros. Brawl (spring 2007, but will probably be pushed way back), and Mario Galaxy.

 - The controllers are responsive and accurate, so you needn't worry about them spazzing out on you or not working properly. There are no wires to get in your way and you can place the sensor bar above or below your TV screen.

 - Nintendo values their customers, and if you have a problem with your console (which you probably won't because they only release quality merchandise, unlike Sony) they will send you a shipping label and fix it right away if it's within warranty. I have had experience with this and trust me, it is very good. I had my DS back with a new screen in 3 days last January; it was amazing. You also get an 90-day extension on your warranty just for registering your Wii online.

Cons:

 - As far as extra controllers go, you have to buy each wii-mote and nunchuck extension separately. Right now the wii-mote costs $40 and the nunchuck (sold separately) is $20, and one of each comes with the console already, so if you want 4 full controllers total you have to pay an extra $180! However, you do not need the nunchuck for every game (you do need it for Wii Sports boxing, fyi), and the console does come with one. I sprung for the extra $40 and just bought another wii-mote without an extra nunchuck, and it's still good for a lot of multiplayer action.

 - The controllers take 2 AA batteries each, and are rumored not to last too long (maybe 20 or 30 hours at best). I haven't had mine long enough to verify this, but since all the controllers take batteries I would recommend buying a rechargeable battery unit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_177?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=177&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have been gaming more than 25 years, and I remember the awkward Power Glove for the NES. This is not that. This is that kind of technology with more than 15 years of refinement. control is so intuitive and easy now, it is only my decades of gaming that keeps me from wondering why other platforms have not adopted something like this sooner.

As of right now (Early October 2007), there are still not quite enough Wii titles to draw lots of gamers, though its backwards-compatibility with the GameCube (over 90% of GameCube games will work with the Wii) and Virtual Console option (downloading games from previous Nintendo as well as Sega Genesis and TurboGrafx-16 platforms) does help that some right now.
Much more outside development will be needed to make this platform viable in the long term, but if developers can get a handle on integrating the motion-control features, this platform will be the class of its generation.
Indeed, if developers can truly harness the motion control technology, there is little way that it can be otherwise.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought the system and all the accoutrements' for my son's birthday in a few weeks. We haven't had the chance to play it yet, because it is a surprise. We have three Nintendo DSs in my house and I have absolutely no doubt that the Wii system will bring many hours of enjoyment to our family entertainment time.
However, after spending $400+ dollars and have yet to buy a game, I had to put the details in my head together to compare it to the monies spent on my XBOX 360 and equivalent equipment.
For starters, anyone purchasing the Wii simply because of the perception that it is cheaper better think again. I recommend purchasing the Wii for those folks who want to experience an entirely different take on video games, if you trust in the quality of Nintendo products and game franchises, as well as it obviously being kid-friendly.
However, when you do the comparative $ math, the XBOX 360 is actually on par with Wii. Here is what I spent for 360 vs. Wii and you'll see that it is a straight-out wash. Please note that I tried to keep an apples-to-apples comparison as much as possible:

XBOX 360 and an additional controller for a second player = $450. Special note: The XBOX 360 $400 model comes with a hard drive, and it's resident controllers and memory can handle the original XBOX games, as well as all XBOX Live Arcade games.

Wii base = $250,
Extra Wii-mote and nunchuck for second player= $60
2 GB SD memory card = $30
2 Wii Classic controllers to play virtual console games = $40
2 GameCube controllers which is a system requirement to play GameCube games = $50
GameCube memory which is another system requirement to play GameCube games. You can not use SD memory = $20
Grand Total = $450

Other things to consider: If you don't have a wireless router, then you either need to get one or purchase the DS/Wii Wifi USB Adapter to hook your box up to a LAN cable = another $40. On the other hand, in defense of Nintendo, if you wanted to go wireless instead of a LAN cable connection on XBOX 360 you would have to spend about $90 for the Wireless adapter. In addtion, if you want to see a progressive scan picture with the Wii, you need to spend another $30 for component cables, something that comes straight out of the box with a XBOX 360.

As some folks already know, the Wii's graphics are currently 480p max and only capable of Dolby Pro Logic II sound. XBOX 360 can reach 1080i (1080p with additional hardware) and Dolby Digital 5.1 sound.

In summary,  if you only want to go with one system, you have to choose between what you are interested in with a next-gen system. If you want real next-gen graphics and sound, I recommend the XBOX 360 (or PS3 I guess, but I don't have one of those yet). If you are looking for an innovative way to play games and love the Nintendo franchise games, then go with the Wii - if you can find one that is.........","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_264?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=264&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Positives:

1) Unique gameplay with movement sensitive remotes.  Our family room now has a large open area in front of the screen.  The couches and chairs have been pushed to the outer parts of the room to allow movement.

1b) Several adult relatives which would not normally touch a game console have enjoyed spending time with Wii Sports

1c) Our neighbor kids keep coming over to play.

2) Effortless setup for WiFi connection

3) The sports game is great for a family fun night.  We have often all ran down to the family room and played a quick game.

4) The Mii channel is more fun than you would think.  Everyone who visits has to first create their own Mii which always results in everyone in the room having a good laugh.

5) We also have Excite Truck which is a good game, but most of it is single player.  One of the modes does allow you to have two people against eachother.  It must be a good game since my brother spend 13 hours one day playing it.

6) Many of the controls for the games are simple to figure out but take time to master.  Boxing is one example where the exact motion you make and the timing of it takes a while to master.

7) The weather channel is nifty.  Obviously you only spend about 2 minutes on it at a time, but it is cool to have.

8) Posting messages (also to/from other Wiis and e-mail accounts) is a neat feature, but we haven't used it other than to try it out.

Here are my gripes:

1) It has crashed perhaps 10 times.  It has failed to read the sports disk several times as well which had me concerned for future robustness.

2) I am using a home cinema projector with a 100"" screen.  The graphics are not that detailed, but once you start playing the game you don't notice.  (note: I am only running with the composite video connection since I don't have the adaptor for component video yet)

3) My game-cube games require a game-cube controller, and mine is corded.  I don't have a Wii classic controller so I can't say if these work.  This is a pain since my room is now set up for wireless controlls and there is no furniture close to the Wii.

4) The WiFi connection seems slow.

5) I downloaded the free internet browser.  It is about the least efficient method I have found to browse the internet.  Obviously not having a keyboard is the major disadvantage.  Secondly the resolution isn't very good so you frequently can't read the small text.

Summary is that it is a great family gaming system with a lot of uniqueness and a good price-point.  I am looking forward to more games which really use the remote (Wario Ware, Wii Play, etc).  I assume that over time the usage of the remote will also improve with newer games.  If you are a hard-core gamer who wants ultra realistic video and immersive graphics you probably won't be impressed with a Wii.  Then again, you may be willing to pay the extra money for a PS3.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_203?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=203&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The controls were easy for all of us to master (using the included Wii Sports game to learn).

We have had the Wii for about 7 months and have about 12 or so games for the system, not including all of the GameCube games that it plays as well (which was important of us since we had about 30).

The ability to connect over our Internet connection and play games with on-line players is a big plus and works very well (we recommend Mario Kart Wii with Wii Wheel for this, very fun). The on-line polls and contests are also fun.

The controllers are fun to use with certain games, but can really be frustrating at times, especially when compared to the Kinect system on the xBox 360.  For the cost, if you're planning on buying a system for your home, consider the Wii after the xBox 360.  If you're a little more patient, look into the xBox 720.

Manning","Wii - a Gaming God","March 22, 2011","The Wii is one of the best gaming console systems around today. The Wii can help one exercise correctly and effectively, lose weight with known trainers, surf the Internet and download and play music and movies. You can even watch YouTube via the Wii. It is a fun and flexible system offering multi uses that fit into any lifestyle. Wii also offers a convenient way to purchase their products through their online store.

The Wii game console allows users to play 3-D rich games of all genres for all ages. Users can play games directly on the Wii, or play interactively with other players over the Internet. Games are ranked by the ESRB that inform players and parents of a game's appropriate ranking.

One very cool feature of the Wii is that you can watch movies (downloaded from Netflix). On a big screen TV, this is equivalent to an in-theater experience. Users can also play the game Biggest Loser, Wii Fit Plus, and any number of sports games.

Not everyone is a fan of the Wii. Some people have complained of inappropriate weight criteria for determining body mass index. Other claim the price of $250 is too expensive. Still others claim the Xbox 360 offers better game graphics etc.

Nintendo is a reputable company, dynamic in its social responsibility. They are active in the Boys and Girls Club and the United Way. They strongly adhere to copyright laws and the like, realizing the negative affect it has on all those involved.

Personally, the Wii is the best gaming console ever!!!!

I never dreamed that a TV game could be so much fun, or that I would want to have one to play.  I wish my dad had lived long enough to find that he could still bowl, even thought he couldn't walk any longer.

I'm trying to get my mom one.  There are so many sports games which exclude a handicapped person -- but not when they can play Wii.  It is like you are actually there.

It is, IMO, the best game to come along in years.  I've heard that it is so popular in rest homes you have to book your time and game.  Even the children love it, they can -- and do -- beat their parents and grandparents -- and are actually learning how to play the games that are just too expensive to do.

Bowling used to be affordable, but not now.  Golfing has always been on the high side, so you wouldn't start your little ones off on a dangerous court at that price.  It is great to teach them concentration and ""to listen"" to the instructions at the beginning of the games, and as you go on.

It is  perfect give for a family of four.  The wonderful bonding in the family is very special.  It is also something that children do not want to lose the ability to play due to bad behavior, so if they lose a day it's hard, but if they lose two in a row, it tends to straighten them up very fast.

The games which come with the game are fun, and there are so many others you can add.  Christmas should be easier this year -- just check out the new games.

Add Tiger Woods Golf to the mix, and have fun.

  So far I've played Twilight Princess, Wario-Ware, Sonic and the Secret Rings, and Super Paper Mario (and Wii Sports, Duh).

-I've had a blast with all of them.

-There's so many great titles in the que that my biggest problem will be affording everything that looks cool.

-It's cheaper by a head than the other two competitors.

-It's got those great Nintendo titles, and its success hopes for good third party support.

-The virtual console--and other Wi-Fi internet features--are great too.

Those are a few of the pros.

The cons for the system:

-No Hi-Def Support and Sub-par graphics (would it have killed Nintendo to give the gpu some anti-aliasing??) 480p looks downright nasty sometimes.

-So far alot of the third party games are crap.

-And of course, you can't seem to find the dang thing anywhere; I had to jump through many a hoop to get mine.

Final verdict: If you can find one, get one. The Wii has already given me all the zany postmodern fun that videos games should provide.

Kudos to Nintendo for the clever R&D and marketing on this guy. Now they just need to fix the supply problem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_218?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=218&reviewerType=all_reviews"

First was the remote not working.  After several attempts to resync the remotes, I turned off the console and now it shows a blank TV screen.  Attempts at troubleshooting with every conceivable combination of console, cables and televisions were unsuccessful.  The Nintendo web site was equally useless providing only the same basic information that any nerd would have tried. Is it plugged in?  Do the lights come on?  Really helpful...NOT!  After reading through all the useless recommendations, it finally just says I need to repair it.

But of course, when I enter in the serial number, the web site can't determine if my brand-new console is under warranty.  How lame is that?  Calling the 800 number they provide connects me to what sounds like a fax machine.  Nice bogus support phone number.  If this is the kind of support and quality product I can expect from Nintendo, then maybe I should just return this product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_265?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=265&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Ok, not VERY VERY poor but I am extremely thrifty. I do not buy video game systems. I do not buy video games (I am convinced that I have video game ADD and can not finish a game). With that said, what do I do? I play games with my friends. What do I look for in a game then? Do I really care about HDTV capabiillities? Or if the lighting effect of System A is better than System B? No. I care about playing games with my friends, being able to learn quickly, and having fun. What many of you fail to realize is there are a lot of people just like me. The market of ""extreme gamer"" isn't that large (my personal speculation, no numbers to back this up; hey, i'm honest). And by ""isn't that large,"" i mean there's no way most of you, who I would classify as ""extreme gamers"" take up even 40% of the video game market. This results in two very interesting results:

1) price is extremely important. I can't imagine having to drop $50 + tax for each game that i really want, let alone having game prices raise to ~$80 and more. Why will this raise so high? developers need to adapt to new technology, spend more time working, etc. Furthermore, I need HDTV to truly enjoy any of this so called super-duper-graphics-that-none-of-you-can-live-without. Suddenly, if I don't have an HDTV, which I don't, nothing really matters anymore does it? You can't compare graphics on the three systems when you're using a tv that takes the red, white, and yellow plug-ins.

Nintendo is working hard to lower costs. They anticipate a lower costing system and lower costing games.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Wii is a revolutionary gaming console that my 6 year-old loves. We have owned this for over a year, and it is going strong.  Hopefully a new updated one will be out soon, as some of the initial quirks need to be worked out, such as the buzzing noise from the disc turning even if games are paused.  The buzzing didn't exist initially, but started after a few months.  The remote sensor bar also doesn't allow enough of a range, and doesn't recognize the remotes if you are more than about 10 feet away.  These are minor issues compared to the positives, so it still is a 5 star product without a doubt.  I think that for kids under 10, the Wii is the best console on the market, but older kids may be more attracted to the PS3.

It makes everyone play a physical game and everyone was happy to cheer others while they were waiting their turn.

Did I say That???? Guilty Pleasure","November 22, 2006","So we unpacked the console that Amazon.com just sent us, with a mix of excitement and wondering whether our expectations (based on previous superlative reviews) would be met. I have to say, being an owner or every console under the sun, that all the reviews are true.

First I have to say on the downside, the graphics are a significant (large) step below the xbox360, but I really believe that Nintendo has hit a nerve on ease of use and changing the paradigm of what a gaming system can be. Why? I have never seen so many people involved in a console, right out of the box! My Wife and Daughter (14 Years) were hooked in about 10 minutes. The wireless remote is brainless.... it just works right out of the box. As an IT professional by career, when does something work out of the box??? In my career next to never.

So it works out of the box.... It's Easy to setup... Its games are fun... What's the downside???? Graphics... They are on the low-end. But Nintendo knew exactly what they were doing.... I'm a gamer, and though I'd never admit it I would buy this unit easily before all my other gaming systems... (which are all stunning in their abilities and output)This console puts the user in the action!

Have a Family? Don't think, just buy it.

While it certainly may not have as good graphics as the X360 or the PS3, the innovative gameplay and relatively easy to learn controls make this a game console that everybody wants to play.

Little","One giant leap for Nintendo","January 27, 2010","The Nintendo Wii is most certainly in a class of its own. It is the first console ever that makes the player move their arms, legs, and other parts of their body. This opens up a world of possibilities for present gaming and future gaming. The Wii is totally focused on allowing the player to freely interact with the game and even other people online. And as I said the possibilities are endless. You can choose to play a variety of sports on Wii Sports and/or the recently released Wii Sports Resort, you can play racing games with the steering wheel (sold separately), go fishing, play on game shows such as Press Your Luck, and much more. Of course, you can do much more than play Wii games. You are also able to play all your old Nintendo Gamecube games. In addition, if you have a wireless network in your area, you can connect the Wii to the Internet to access a wide variety of downloadable content, such as retro NES and N64 games. The web browser (available at the online Wii shopping channel for $5.00) allows you to actually browse through the Internet and is similar to PS3's web browser. If all this were not enough, you receive several Wii ""channels"" that are preloaded on the system, so even if you don't have web browser, you can still access news and weather from around the world, simply by pointing to virtually any part of the on screen globe. Another Wii channel is the Mii Channel, where you can upload your mii (wii characters that the player creates). If you are looking for the future in gaming and entertainment (or just an inexpensive video game system), consider Wii first.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_185?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=185&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Wii did not disappoint! We LOVE this system and have averaged at least 4 hours of playtime EVERY day since it was purchased back in early February. I can't tell you what it's done for our social life or how much fun it is to compete against each other one-on-one... you'll just have to buy one and see for yourself. We have a 16 year old daughter with multiple disabilities and even SHE can join in the fun with some of the games like bowling.

I was one of those unfortunate souls who didn't fully appreciate what a game system can actually bring to family/personal relationships and failed to get one when they were first released, but I don't lament having paid twice the regular price for it in order to receive it in time for his birthday. It was WELL worth the difficulty of finding and procuring one; actually gave me quite a sense of accomplisment.

I purchased Resident Evil 4 for it as well as Wii Play and Wii Carnival for his system, in order to give him the well-rounded experience. He loves them all and is actually setting foot in Game-stop stores every week to peruse other titles!

He tells me this was the best birthday present ever (among those of the past which included: Flight time learning to fly a small plane, a high-quality metal detector and hour-long Swedish Massage sessions!) and I couldn't be happier.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_210?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=210&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I didn't get into any of the playstations or the Xbox, or anything else.  However the Wii has captured me with its different way of playing.  You can play games like you would for any other gaming console but you also have the interactive motion from the Wii remote.  Playing sports by actually acting them out for me makes video games a lot more fun.  I would recommend everyone to give this a try, even people who have never loved video games can find fun in this.  We have had friends over with children of all ages and everyone has had great fun playing against each other.

I mainly own a wii for mario games such as: mario kart wii, (it's more fun playing online) super mario galaxy, (can't wait for SMG 2) wario's shake it, super smash bros, super mario bros wii + more. my only complaint is that the physical control movements can sometimes make your wrists sore when you constantly shake the controller but other than that I have nothing else to complain about. I don't believe most people want a wii for all that excercising sport crap but the only sport game I love is the wii sports resorts that ones a fun worthy sport game, But I guess the wii is more appealing to alot of old school nintendo fans such as myself and alot of new or mostly older mario fans, but if your not one of those people who are old school nintendo gamers then you will probably not like the nintendo wii at all.

With its wi fi connection support built in you can play with people from all over the world, with wii wear you can get classic nintendo console games like Super Mario Bros.The controls at times get hard to get used to but the Wii has games to help you get used to the controls because right now they are unlike any video game system controls.These sports games will get you geared up for when you get and future games, if these controls the wii controller and the nunchuck are not your bag then you can get a regular controller or it as it gives you that option plus you can hook up a gamecube controller with 4 players at a time this system has the best multi player control.The graphics while not as close or superior to its competetors the graphics are beautiful for this system
rent Super Mario Galaxy and you will see very quickly just what these graphics are able to do as they are very impressive.It is not hi def or blue ray capable be in mind this is just a game system and not a cd or
hi def advanced entertainment machine if you want that you should look
at XBox 360 or PS3.The only complaint i would have is that nintendo just dosent get out games fast enough whereas you always see XBox and PS3 bringing out big titles every week,on Nintendo your wait will be more like monthly with is a big downside it was the same problem they seem to have in the past and still have it today.Other then that if you like a fun system that will entertain you and your hole family then this is the system for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_213?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=213&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The only problems I encountered with my wii and that kept it from being a perfect 5 was the wifi. I had to research online for an hour to find out the wii has major issues with many home routers. In order to get the wii to even WORK on my router, I had to disable WPA and force it to use channel 11 which is overused in my apartment complex already. Even then I would get a random error code every now and then. Due to this I had to go out and buy a LAN adapter.

I like how it stuck to focusing on the games.  Not like Sony and Microsoft that suddenly thinks your video game console needs to play DVD's, download music into your ipod, record the recent South Park episode, wash your car, and vaccuum your floor.  Ok so I made up the last two, but I think you get the point.

Quality titles are on the system.  Not many at this moment that will blow you away, but alot of fun to play.  With Nintendo coming out with the usual suspects soon aka Mario Kart, Metroid, Smash Bros, etc...  you will soon have plenty to play.  Gamers that like third party games may be a bit dissappointed with the system because they don't make many titles on the Wii.

The Wiimote is the best part of the system.  I have had many problems with the newer games as they have tried to put too many things into so few buttons.  You had to at times contort your fingers into positions that it hurt after long playing periods.  With the Wiimote its almost solely motioned control.  So a sword slash is a mere flick of the wrist.  Though watch out for others when playing.  Its very easy to backhand somebody else if you get too close to them.  Playing in a large room with plenty of space to move around is suggested.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_191?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=191&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The main thing I want to focus on here is that this system is FUN. People seem to complain a little about the graphics, but I'm not purchasing a virtual art gallery, I'm purchasing a gaming system.

I used to be hooked into the perpetual upgrade cycle of hardware that exists on the PC gaming front, but somewhere along the way over the last 7 or 8 years, the industry became more about eye candy and less about the actual game. If you look at most of the top 10, 20 or whatever number of all-time game lists, you'll see games that are often way behind the graphics curve. Most of them are lacking visually simply because they're older games (i.e. Diablo or Half-Life for the PC), but the main point is that they're fun and they leave the player with a memorable and entertaining experience. All the eye candy in the world simply cannot make up for a game that lacks that. There are plenty of gorgeous games with no content to them, and shelling out $400 or more for systems to play the latest in games with cutting edge polygon counts, textures or rendering is akin to throwing down hundreds of dollars on a mannequin that looks exactly like Jessica Alba in the flesh.

Not that there is anything wrong with the PS3 or the Xbox 360, but there's a reason why the Wii is outselling everything else; it comes down to fun (and price). Yes, there are crappy games on the Wii and a lot of really fun games on those other systems, but in my opinion, when the Wii developers get it right (i.e. Metroid Prime Corruption, Wii Sports, Resident Evil 4), the experience is far beyond what you can get from games on other consoles. If you're enjoying the gameplay to the fullest extent, most people don't even realize that the graphics aren't perfect.

The lower graphics tech is part of what keeps the system's price down, which puts it within reach of just about anyone with a job and the ability to save money. Personally, despite still having both a high end desktop and laptop PC suitable to run the latest whiz-bang games coming out, I haven't even looked at either of them for games since I purchased my Wii...I spend my time playing the Wii or looking at the release dates for the next Wii game that I can hardly wait to play. And coming from a former PC game and hardware-junkie, that says a lot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was never interested in sitting around playing games on the computer or TV, I would get too bored. The closest I would do are quick games like Tetris.

We had tried this at a couple friends' houses, and my husband absolutely loved it. I wasn't sure, but kept an eye on it and when I saw the Wii Fit Plus, I was very interested. I am pretty good about exercising but it's easy to get bored in a cold New England winter, and I hoped this would keep me motivated and interested. We got the Wii and the Fit Plus a week ago, and I LOVE it! My husband was very surprised at how much I use it each day. He has definitely been more willing to exercise also.

I have receommended it to everyone that doesn't already have one, from my kids to my mother. It was well worth the money and I'd recommend it to all ages.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_188?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=188&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We bought this as a family gift to ourselves with monies from relatives who didn't know what to buy us (they sent the money instead).  Best $$ we ever spent!  You have to move to play ... big huge difference from other forms of entertainment indoors!  We noticed within a week increased general energy levels.

I recommend this to anyone.  Even our 4 yr old daughter can play the Wii Sports, and the Wii Mini games.  We got the gun control as well that came with a crossbow game, and she is already able to play that.  She isn't allowed to play more than 45 minutes per day (read the warnings for risks to your brain as to why when you get the system).  She has beaten the CPU at tennis already, and readily scores at most of the games (including the crossbow game).

Also, the ability to create Mii's is amazing (we made one of each of us, then made buddies for them).  For us, having a Mii that looks like we really do is fantastic ... but you can create anything you wish!

The other thing is, you can load your Mii into your remote ... head over to another house with a Wii, and actually use your Mii in games there as well!

You can buy points, and buy more games from Wii's internet access (Wii store).  And, your Mii's can travel (if you opt for it) out into the Wii universe and go to other Wii's to parade, or participate in teams, etc.

Overall, this is better than anything for PC in the activity level (requires more physical action than a PC or most game systems).  Having to actually swing your ""club"" in golf or baseball, for instance ... bowling ... that sort of thing.  It is fantastic... and better than the ordinary sedentary evenings we had been used to prior to it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_178?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=178&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My favorite thing bout it is the virtual console all though I like the wii sports and stuff. I happen to be big into classic gaming and love the ability to go online and download classics from Nes , sega , snes etc. I also enjoy the fact with the sports it feels like your really doing it like your right there at a game or bowling alley having a great time . The invention of using a remote for a controller is really cool. I give this a high rating cause Its too fun to give it a lower one. I happen to of gotten mine from walmart but I was paitent calling for bout  a year i just happen to be at the right place at right time and got one .So far my fave game on the wii sports is the bowling game I think thats just bout everyone's fave actually ;). I like all the neat games and stuff you can get for it the backward compatiblity is great makes for this system will probably eventually have the largest selection of titles with the vc outta any . I also enjoy making and trading miis and the contests for them is fun. I like the voting channel, the internet channel that you purchase for extra wii points.

Let me digress a moment just to say that the Wii was a great purchase for my family.  It provides something a little different for everyone who plays it, all of us finding something in particular that we can gravitate toward.  (Personally, though I really enjoy the movement sensitive controllers, the real joy for me has been discovering Gamecube titles like Residet Evil 0 - 1, and the Metroid games.)

Since few things are indestructable, however, what happens if your Wii goes kablam and gives up the ghost?  Recently, one of our remote controllers stopped functioning.  It continued to work on some movements, but was non-responsive on others, primarily swinging.  After replacing the batteries, and doing all of the basic diagnostic things you do when a piece of hardware is being stubborn, I took a visit to the Nintendo website to find out more.  The problem was documented there, and it did seem to point to a failure with the remote.  I visited some other websites and got the same feedback.  All that swinging around and shaking of the remote, can, in some cases, result in a damaged controller.  It's not common, but it can happen.  I went back to Nintendo.com and followed the links to the customer service section.  After filling out a brief form (which doesn't ask for any product info other than what's wrong with the device and the month/year it was purchased) I was told to wait for my UPS label to arrive within 4-6 days.  In three business days the label arrived, along with a statment saying that there would be no charge for the repair.  The device was mailed off and I am currently waiting for it to be returned.  The wait time is guaranteed not to exceed 4 to 6 weeks.  That may seem like a long time to do without a controller, but I'm a pretty cheap person, and I would gladly wait that long for a free repair.  Not to mention free shipping & handling.

Good customer service (or, ""great"" customer service in this case) goes a long way with me.  I can forgive a lot of things except for companies who refuse to stand behind their products.  In this case, I have to say that Nintendo just made me a lot happier with my Wii investment.

In short, if you do happen to buy a Wii - which, for my money, is undeniably the best system available - and you encounter a malfunction (other than throwing your remote through the television) rest assured that Nintendo will make the replacement a painless, albeit ""inexpensive,"" experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_36?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=36&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The style of play was innovative for the time and was good for casual sports or workout type games(still good for an occasional workout). But the overall choice of games for me was a bit limited and many of the games released towards the end were largely forgettable. Still a fun system for families(or folks who aren't normally dedicated gamers) to enjoy together.","3.0 out of 5 stars","",""

More than just a video game...","November 27, 2008","The Wii is a lot of fun for people of all ages. I won't go into the product specs because 100s of reviewers have already covered it. What differentiates the Wii from other gaming products is the physical activity it provides with the movement-sensing Wiimote, and the Internet connectivity that makes the News-reading experience more visual (you can look at the World map and drill down to read news in any part of the World). It's an essential add to any family room.

I have connected the Wii directly to my Epson projector (sans the sound until I buy a receiver) and the nearly 100"" image makes playing Wii sports (a great source of exercise when it's too late at night to hit the gym or the weather is bad outside) very enjoyable, and I can read the news in Slide-show mode while talking on the phone with family and friends...

The set-up was a cinch! I was able to do it in minutes and hardly needed to read the instructions.

Now that it's been out a few years, it's still fun, but like the GameCube before it, the Wii is still the third best option out there for gamers.

The Wii is fun to play with groups of people. But there are some flaws. The controls lag noticeably. The graphics are inferior. And there aren't as many ""serious"" games for the Wii as there are for the PS3 and the XBox360.

If you have people over often, you're a casual gamer, or you're a serious gamer that has to have every console, you should get this. There are still lots of fun and innovative games for the Wii. But if you are only going to buy one gaming system, the Wii would be my third choice. Especially now that the PS3 has the Move and the Xbox360 has the Kinect, there's really no reason to get the Wii, unless you love Mario $300 much.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'd recommend this system to anyone no matter the age.  It's the least expensive of the gaming systems out there right now.  Yeah it's going to probably take a while to find one.

I'm a 29-year old woman who hasn't played Nintendo since the 80s and early 90s.  I recently had some great memories of playing Zelda, and found out that the Wii can download lots of old games (even from Sega and other gaming systems) for around $5-10 each.  I immediately got a Wii---I have seriously been hooked ever since.  The Wii Sports games (and Sports Resort) are very fun to get started, but then I got some of my first exercise titles (Wii Fit Plus and about 10 others), and it was over for me.  I look forward to working out with the Wii daily in ways that I could never feel about going to the gym, and I've lost weight, gotten pretty toned, and gotten some youthful 'zest' back in the process.  Most of my titles are exercise, singing, and dancing games...and now I'm really enjoying the time I do spend at home.

The Wii Fit came on Wed. Nov. 18th, and the rest on Thurs Nov 19th! Talk about FAST shipping!! I was very satisfied with my purchase and also took advantage of the free Amazon.com $50 gift card offer, since I was already planning on buying both the Wii & Wii Fit Plus anyway. Another perk! Overall, very very satisfied with Amazon.com!

The Wii itself is very fun, and definitely a family gaming system. It gets you off the couch, and even people who have never used video games will find it easy to use after a short while. It's not really for a serious gamer, as there aren't many action/fantasy games out there for Wii. This is perfect for everyone else. I bought the WiiFit Plus for my mom and I to use and we just started, but already love it! Very cool stuff...I can't wait to use more of it!

Side note: My boyfriend just bought the game ""Punch Out"" for Wii, and it's quite fun and a work-out as well. Good game for everyone!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's the perfect game system for families becuase it typically gets you up off your rear end and the majority of the games are family friendly in terms of graphics and thematic content.  Our 6 year old does a great job playing, but it's been a little tougher for the 4 and 3 year old to get the hang of it.

We also got the Wii EA Sports Active game so that my wife and I could work out together.  We break a sweat everytime.  We've done four workouts in the 30 day challenge thus far and we're both sore.

Wii Can't Get Enough!","February 18, 2010","My family and I have been die-hard GameCubers for the past 7 years so we know what to expect from the quality of graphics and styles of games available. People must do their research. It does not have the ""intense graphics"" of the other systems but I think the innovative way of interacting with the games/system makes up for what the Wii isn't. Except for the fact that they all play games, the Wii cannot be compared equally to the PS3 or 360. It's wonderful for what it is.

Set up was a breeze. We were up and racing (Mario Kart - Great Game!!) within 30 minutes (and that included time to rearrange dvd player, etc. to create a space on entertainment center).

I don't have a flat screen HD TV so I was happy that the system came with the R/Y/W type jacks. Also people have ""complained"" about only one remote, but it should be expected that additional accessories need to be purchased if necessary. (My GameCube came with one controller and NO GAME!)

We are very happy with our decision to purchase a Wii. We knew what to expect BEFORE we purchased it (even tho it was a no-brainer for the Mario fanatics that we are!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_187?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=187&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you are looking to buy a Wii, whether you call yourself a hardcore gamer or a newcomer, you are going to have a lot of fun.

I have loved video games from a young age and have played many video game systems. The Wii is a great product, and I highly recommend you pick one up.

The Wii really is a video game console for everyone. My six-year-old cousin has no problem playing Super Mario Galaxy, and it is easy for me to get my parents to play a racing game or Wii Sports. I've even gotten my grandparents to play Wii Sports. Meanwhile, I enjoy these games but I also play more challenging games like the Legend of Zelda or Metroid Prime 3.

The Wii has a clean, easy to use, interface. It has channels like a weather channel, news channel (you can read newspapers), internet channel for surfing the web, photo channel where you can upload digital photos and display them on your TV, and even a message board channel so you can leave messages for your friends or family. Internet access is free. You can also pay to download older games from previous consoles using the Wii shop channel. Channels keep being added. Many games support online multiplayer, too.

Unlike other current-gen video game consoles, the Wii truly is backwards compatible. You can play all last-gen Gamecube games on the Wii and use Gamecube controllers and memory cards. There are quite a few Wii games that allow you to use a Classic controller OR a Gamecube controller.

A lot of people have commented on how they think the Wii remote is ""gimmicky."" The Wii remote has really refreshed gaming for me, actually. I love the precision I have when playing games now. If a company takes the time to program their game effectively for the remote, it really pays off. First person shooters, such as Metroid Prime 3 and Medal of Honor: Heroes, are a joy to play. Many other Nintendo games also use the Wii remote wonderfully. These games use the controller the right way, and more companies need to follow suit.

Although Nintendo's console is not as advanced graphics-wise as the PS3 or Xbox 360, is more powerful than its predecessor, the Gamecube. The Wii and its games are in a lower price range so you aren't paying for high definition graphics. In all honesty, even though I appreciate higher quality graphics, I am very happy with my Wii.

With the Wii, Nintendo has opened up a totally new consumer market: casual gamers. Contrary to what some people are saying, there are more ""hardcore"" games for the system than you might think. The Wii does have some quality ""Teen"" and ""Mature"" rated games that are more serious/violent, but many of the great games on the system are games anyone can play. If you are under the impression that many Wii games are ""childish"" because they are not violent and can be colorful, you are missing out on some amazing games. Games like Super Mario Galaxy, Metroid Prime 3, and the Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, are just pure fun, and they are extremely well made. If you want a fun console with quality games that all ages can enjoy, get yourself a Wii. The other consoles do not even compare when it comes to having QUALITY games for ALL ages.

So many people are buying a Wii, I think it has HUGE potential. Unfortunately, right now very few companies besides Nintendo are taking full advantage of the Wii's capabilities. Nintendo has upped the graphics for some of its recent games, but many other games look last-generation. The Wii is ideal for first person shooters because of its unique remote, but not many shooters are being made for it. Since there are so many casual gamers buying the Wii, many companies are either porting games (some of which are great games, like Resident Evil 4 and Okami, so I don't mind those so much, but I do wish they would create good new games), or trying to make a bundle off of mediocre casual games. Many of the video game newcomers are gobbling up mediocre games up like crazy, and they are hesitant to try more of the challenging, quality games. So, if you are a newcomer to video games, I implore you, please try out different games! I started out as a casual gamer, too. Yes, you will probably be terrible when you first start playing more difficult games, but once you practice and get better, you might find something you really enjoy. So don't just get a Wii to play Wii Fit or Wii Sports. Get the most out of your console and rent or buy other games that are rated highly. If more people buy these quality games, then more quality games will be made because companies will consider them to be profitable. Websites like IGN and Gamespot have reviews and ratings from critics and regular people, so you'll know if a game is worth buying or not. If you get stuck on a game, buy a strategy guide or use a website like Gamefaqs for free walkthroughs. And if you don't want to spend 40-50 bucks on a game, just wait until the price drops.

Even though the Wii has some wasted potential, I really enjoy mine. The Wii is a very unique gaming system, and I hope you consider buying one. If you do, I encourage you to explore different genres of games and take full advantage of your Wii. The Wii is already a good gaming system but it has even more potential that needs to be unlocked by consumers like you.

Update: One year later and still the same problems as I stated above. I've been playing my Xbox 360 more than my Wii. But there are some more mature games out (such as the Conduit and Madworld), and Wii Motion-Plus is also available, which should mean games with even more wii-mote precision. There are some great Nintendo games coming out over the next year or so. We know that Metroid: Other M, Pikmin 3, Mario Galaxy 2, and a new Zelda are in the works.

Overall: 8.7/10. A great system, but not amazing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_181?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=181&reviewerType=all_reviews"

You can also play your Gamecube games on this system and, surprisingly, the graphics are much better and you can use your Gamecube controllers and memory cards.

I've recommended the Wii to numerous parents at my child's school for the exercise and coordination benefits.  There's no feeling guilty about letting your kids play the Wii.

I love the Zelda/Link games and Super Mario adventure games, but Super Metroid was a disappointment due to frustrating controller use, as was  Nights.  Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles featured disappointing graphics, music and, once again, frustrating game play.  That was the final straw for us:  No more spending good money on bad games for the WII!  So we recently got a PS3 and are loving it as well as the games (5) that we have bought for the PS3.

I suppose the WII is fine for sports games, but for role-playing/adventure games, there just aren't enough titles available.

The WII is still in the house, but collecting dust until they come out with a new Zelda or Mario title.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_261?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=261&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Greenway","Best console in the history of mankind!!!","July 12, 2008","The wii is the gaming experiance in the history of mankind. I've had my wii since it first came out in 2006. The style of control is great for first person shooters and racing games. I've had no problems with my wii and it is very easy to setup, update, and connect to the internet. The shop channel is great so I can play my favorite games from older consoles. Who needs graphics when you have really good interface, people say the wii sucks because of graphics. The only reason I am considering getting a second console from this generation, the ps3, is because there are some games from the playstation series that I like. Nintendo always releases their well known games on thier new consoles then there's all of the new games that you can get for it. Sometimes you have to look around a little bit to find a game you like. Some people say there are no good games, so far, I've seen at least five to ten good games for wii from each genre.

Overall, don't fall for the bad reviews for the wii because they are all lies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_235?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=235&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It looks like a lot of fun in the commercials, with the people jumping around and really getting into their games. I think I may be too old school for this kind of gaming. I love to play all kind of games (I am 38) but I have not found the Wii to be so wonderful just yet. I like to sit and be comfortable while I play. We have the sports games, Sonic vs. Mario, and boxing. I just rented Thrillsville and am curious to find out more about that game. It has interesting use of the controller, where you tilt it to tilt the track you are adding on to your roller coaster. Sonic is an olympic competetion and involves a lot of the same action as the sports one. They are fun and my kids, 8, 6 and 3, really like them. I enjoy the graphics. I think it may take some time for me to see the value of the extra cost of the Wii. I would have put off buying a Wii another year but then we could not play any of the new games and I don't like putting my money towards a game when a better version of it is already available (though you can get most Gamecube games at great prices now, for obvious reasons). I think the Wii games are a lot of fun and the Mii characters you make yourself are wonderful. Once I get used to all the movement and extras like internet connection, I may feel it was worth the extra money for the Wii.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_215?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=215&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Amos","After two years, the novelty has worn off","April 1, 2009","And now that I think about it, that's pretty much what I enjoyed most about this system, was the novelty of it.  I was one of the people that went to the mall before it opened on the day that they started the preorders and I was so excited when I got mine on the first day it came out whereas so many others had to wait.  The Wii Sports was (and still is of course) just a blast.  My friends and I had a great time setting up our Miis and playing bowling and tennis...  but the fun went on a downward spiral from there.  Never did I find a game that my friends and I enjoyed as much as we did the sports, and that's the game that the system comes with for free!  Did I spend 250.00 for Wii Sports?  Perhaps I wouldn't go that far, but after leaving the system collecting dust for the last six months, I'm starting to wonder what I really did buy the system for.

I'll start with the games.  The Wii has some gems, but most of these were released early in the system's lifespan and the sheer amount of junk overwhelms the great.  When I go to Best Buy or any other game retailer, I'm overwhelmed by the amount of games clogging the shelves, and 99% of them are ones I'd never play.  The actual Nintendo franchise games, which are the only ones I'm really interested in, are few and far between.  The last one of those that I bought was Smash Brothers, and my friends and I lost interest in that in less than a month.  Before that was Mario Kart Wii, and I have to say, that was a serious disappointment.  It didn't add anything new like Double Dash did and it just wasn't very fun.  Twilight Princess of course is a great game and Mario Galaxy is a triumph.  Aside from Wii Sports (and a few of the games on Wii Play) these are about the only games I've continually enjoyed on the Wii.  The games are mostly oriented toward casual gamers and kids.

The main hook for me on the system was the backwards compatibility and that's still what I enjoy most about it.  I play Gamecube games on there more than I play Wii games (Ikaruga ftw!)  As far as the Virtual Console goes, I've downloaded and enjoyed a few games and eventually wanted to own more, but I really started to feel like I was being ripped off after a while.  The prices for these old games, some of them 25 years old, really are way too high and you don't get to download a trial of anything.  Even a 64 game isn't worth ten dollars.  And most of these are games that I already spent 50.00 on years and years ago.  Should we be cut some slack?  So I download these games, thinking that I'm going to have a blast like back in the day... it doesn't always work like that.  Some games definitely stand the test of time, but some of them just aren't as fun the second time around and would've been better left happily in my memories.  There is the Wiiware, but I haven't been interested in any of those games, and of course I can't test them to see if I'm speniding my money wisely.  I'd rather spend the same prices on my XBOX 360 for a Live Arcade game that has entirely new content and I can actually play with friends online.

This brings me into my next topic which is multiplayer.  This is one of my favorite aspects of gaming and I rarely buy a game that I can't play with friends.  Now don't get me wrong, Wii has no shortage of multiplayer, but what it has is severely lacking.  I've had 360 for almost a year now (this review isn't a 360 fanboy bash on Nintendo, I promise!) and the multiplayer experience is far better in every aspect than it is on the Wii.  Sure with the Wii, you can get some friends and bundle up on the couch and have some laughs.  But anything online is very indirect and impersonal.  Like in Mario Kart or Smash Brothers for example, you have no idea who you're playing, you can't talk to them... you might as well not be playing online at all.  With 360, you see when your friends are online, you see what they're playing, you can compare achievements to see what you've accomplished versus what they've accomplished, you can talk to them at any time, even while playing separate games... the list goes on.  With 360 I feel connected to all of my friends whereas on Wii, unless they're in the room with me, I'm pretty much playing by myself.

Graphics... I know there are a lot of gamers who don't care about them and if a game is fun, I really don't either, but when I spend 50.00 on a next generation console game, I don't expect that the graphics will look as good (or in some cases much worse!) than it did on Gamecube.  My wife bought Harvest Moon and it looks close to something you find on the Nintendo DS, just on a very enlarged screen.  I have a high def TV and even the component cables for enhanced definition can't make some of these games look good.

Now of course there are some good things about the Wii.  For one, since it's Nintendo hardware, you can expect it to be durable.  I haven't personally tested the Wii's durability, but you know by the density of it, it could probably survive a few tumbles down the stairs, whereas plenty of brand new 360s crap out without the aid of any external damage at all.  The motion controls are fun in some games, even if they do get a but gimmicky after a while.  There are some fun things to do in the menu, like make various Miis that look like celebrities (there's nothing quite like playing a game of tennis with Ray Charles facing off against Admiral Ackbar), the voting channel, the worldwide news, the weather and so on.

I do appreciate that Nintendo has made a system that's accessible to ""everyone,"" and that's great for ""everyone"" else, but the system is definitely lacking for the non-casual gamer like me.  The novelty of the motion controls wears off pretty fast, the truly fun games are few, the graphics are weak and the multiplayer is just depressing.  But hey, my six year-old loves it (although even he's also playing more 360 nowadays.)  I'd love for Nintendo to eventually start making their games for other consoles that have a better community based system where I can enjoy them more, but with the success of the Wii, why would they want to?  So take my review into advisement if you're trying to decide on a console to buy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_175?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=175&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When I was a kid, I got the SNES for Christmas and still play most of the games today. Nothing beats playing Super Castlevania 4 or Super Mario Land.

Before I played with the Wii, I was not sure if it would be as great as the PS3 because of it'sgraphics. But because the PS3 has more violent games, I turned to the Wii because I wanted something family friendly. I got a PS2 when it first came out and played mostly racing games, the violent games did not appeal to me much.

Anyway, playing the Wii really blew my breath away! True the graphics don't compare to the PS3, but the games are much more fun and interactive. Plus the Nintendo store in New York City is a great place to hang out and connect with other Nintendo fans. I'm dying to try the new sports pack game and play the basketball games. Also I'm digging the new Tiger Woods game and the awesome Grand Slam Tennis.

Until the Wii.  Not only is this thing seriously fun and useable without super-human thumb dexterity and the ability to remember finger dance routines worth of the best Blackberry user I've ever known, but it's simplicity is an engineering marvel.

The Wii has gotten into my daily life away from the device - as an example, I now now have a new ""vocabularii"" that provides hours of laughter ""biitwiin mii"" and my friends.  Even when I'm not playing a game, I enjoy going to the weather channel and spinning the globe around.

And my triceps!  Boxing, games where you have to pump your arms to run, tennis, Wii fitness in general - finally, a way to ""work out"" AND have fun.  Kidding aside, you CAN be winded and sore after playing a game, which is a refreshing change to the couch potato feeling you can get playing other systems.

 The Remotes and Nunchucks are a bit spendy when you have to buy three more of each. The Wii usually only comes with one set. Altho, you can hold off on the Nunchucks as there aren't very many multipayer games where you can use three or more people that need the Nunchucks. Usually just two people need it. And then you'll have to buy the Game Pad to play the older games if you are used to using it. But then some of the Wii's are now coming with the rubber ""protectors"" already on the Remotes so that's great.

 A blast when playing with more then one person on some of the games. We haven't really bought many games for it as the grand kids are just getting to the point of being able to play now. The attention span just isn't there yet. The games we do have are great to play.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Wagner","Fun, Yet Get Your Credit Card Ready....","April 14, 2009","For Christmas we purchased three Wii's for our family members (some of who are married and have kids of their own). We also own Xbox360 and PS3 (we're a gaming family!).
The Good:  From a family perspective this is the ultimate 'play together' opportunity. Get the Wii that comes with Wii Sports, as we've found that the bowling, tennis, baseball, and golfing are the best of all the sports emulation games for the Wii. On the Sports disc they are all together! The Mario Kart racing game is also fun. The ability to go online and play with others, a common feature now, is expanded and made more entertaining by the creation of 'Mii's'. This is the 'you' character you can use for many of the games. You can create it to look just like you, or make it as crazy as you want. Even more fun is that there is no limit to the number of Mii's you can create, and all those you have end up being spectators or characters in the games you play. A few websites even have instructions on how to make lookalike Mii's for famous people. We have all the staff from the Office, the Simpsons, etc.
While the Wii is a great family system, it loses some of it's luster when used as a stand alone. Face it, bowling by yourself is not that exciting at the bowling alley, let alone in front of your TV. For non-family play, the game is focused on tweeners and below (<12). This is not a system to get your teenager, for them get the Xbox360 or PS3.
The Bad: The basic system comes with one controller and one numchuck (another type of controller).  You'll need two or more to effectively play family games, otherwise you're constantly handing off controllers, or you'll be unable to play against someone (like tennis). In addition, if you want to avoid using hundreds of batteries, you need a recharge method, the most viable being the plug in recharge stations you can buy. Get one that has at least 4 places to recharge, as you'll soon be collecting controllers like crazy. While most of the games can be played with the controller as is, almost all games have available (for purchase of course) controllers to give you that special 'feel'. These include sports ones that hook onto the controller (i.e., a bat, a hockey stick, a ping pong paddle) or shooting/slashing games (i.e., various guns and swords). While it adds to the fun, it decreases the pocketbook.
Overall: A fun system for family and friend gaming. Lots of potential to be nickled and dimed on all the accessories, much more so they the other big video game systems out there. For single play, not the first choice to get for older gamers, this one is for younger players. We've had fun using it, and it definitley brings the family/friends together in good humor, so it's been worth it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

In the past the game system where mine.  On the rare occasion that someone in the house wanted to play they felt obligated to ask me.  Well with the Wii it is a system for the entire family.  My wife and kids enjoy it as much as I do.  The games that came with the system are fun and easy to play.  My wife enjoys the fact that groundbreaking cordless controllers incorporate physical movement into the game playing experience.  The Wii is designed to get you moving.  One of the biggest complaints about gaming is that kids are no longer exercising because they are playing video games.  This is not the case with the Wii.

One of the most exciting features of the Wii is the Wii remote or Wii-mote.  You can control your players in the game by pushing the buttons on the Wii remote but you also might have to swing your arms or move the controller through the air and the Wii console translates those movements into movements on the screen.  The Wii remote is the primary aspect that distinguishes the Wii system from all others.

The Wii easily connects to the internet.  This feature allows old school gamers to down load retro arcade and home video games onto their Wii console at a relatively inexpensive cost.  Most games range from 500 to 200 will points ($5.00-$20.00).  All of the Donkey Kong series, tecmo bowl, Mario franchise and about a hundred others have been included.  Some of the systems that have lent their most popular games to the Wii library include, the original NES (Nintendo Entertainment System), the SNES (Super Nintendo Entertainment System), N64,  (Nintendo 64), TurboGrafx16, Sega Genesis, NEOGEO and several arcade games.  More titles are being added every month.  You can also surf the world wide web, store photos, check the weather and I understand that soon you will be able to download music.  One of the most used aspects of the Wii's internet capabilities is online play.  Interacting and doing battle with other gamers all over the world is far from new, but it is still an intriguing aspect of gaming.

A drawback to the Wii is that you have to purchase additional controllers and accessories to get everything out of the most games.  Many of the games you can download require a ""classic"" controller.  The Wii Fit board costs quite a bit but it is a way to get a pretty good workout for those of us who could are not world-class athletes.  There have been reports of significant weight loss based on some Wii and Wii Fit games.  Most of the additional purchases that I have made have been well worth the cost.

To me I can see the Wii as more than just a gaming system.  It is a way to have family time, a social networking device, it is a news and weather outlet as well as a way to get some exercise and have a pretty good time playing video games.  The Wii is pretty close to being a lifestyle.  I would recommend this to anyone.

Dively","Simply the BEST","November 19, 2006","This system is beyond all my expectations, and they were high, believe me.  The wii-mote is so intuitive and works so well, you are immersed in the game like never before.  I personally like the fitness challenge on Wii Sports, it is nice to see your progress.  Also, Zelda is pretty awesome.

I haven't taken advantage of the Wii channel yet, but I definitely will when the games I want become available.

On a side bar....you people who pay inflated prices to get these systems realize that you're taking a HUGE chance and could be shooting yourself in the foot....right?  Case in point:  While I was attempting to get a Wii for my Brother-in-Law's family, I spoke to clerks in Gamestop and Best Buy about all the new systems.  BOTH places had their BRAND NEW Playstation 3 break down within one hour and one week respectively.  Now, lets pretend you bought a PS3 at a retailer...your money would be refunded, or they would replace the system.  NOW lets say you paid some ridiculous amount on E-Bay or Amazon, guess how much money you will be refunded???  (the cost of the system new, IF you're lucky because the person selling the system couldn't be held responsible for manufacturing flaws).  Simple economics, unless you have the money to just throw away, why don't you just wait to get it from a retailer?  As wonderful as the Wii is, I wouldn't justify paying more than the MSRP.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_219?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=219&reviewerType=all_reviews"

excellent graphics, easy to navigate menu's online connectivity..what more could you ask for?
When i was a kid i had the nes and snes. I thought the snes was the most fun to play, and i played it for many years, then i sort of got out of gaming until the wii came out. at first, i was hesitant to get one. but i played one at a family members house and i was hooked! after searching high and low for 9+ months, i finally found one and got it.
brought it home and fired it  up. great system. i also purchased a wireless linksys router so i could get online with my wii.
that opened another world of great games thanks to nintendo's virtual console that is included with the wii. (you have to buy wii points card at retail stores or put your credit card # in to get points.) the points are then used to buy classic games like mario bros, super mario world, mario kart 64, starfox 64, megaman etc.)
If you plan on playing the classic games, you will have to buy the 19.99 classic controller. this is like a snes controller and allows you to play the retro games on the wii. new titles for the virtual console are being released all the time.
if your fighting the choice of to buy or not to buy a wii, trust me, get one! you will be suprised how much fun it is!

the only thing i don't like about the wii is that it CANNOT play cd's or dvds. don't know what nintendo was thinking there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_180?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=180&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I especially like Wii fit plus and the accountability of weigh-ins as well as gentle reminders.  I bought a used version of this game and there were no instructions.

Low down on the PS3:
Blu Ray reader
*Demos available
*Add-ons available
40GB to 80GB hard drive
Better graphics than Wii
More expensive

*Internet connection required

The advantages the Wii has are mainly its innovative motion controls and games. Wii is fun. Wii is definitely more family oriented, however their are normal and adult titles, just far fewer.

Teen(119) 21%
Mature(27) 5%
Total: 568

It depends on which types of games you like and how you prefer to play them. Different genres play better on different systems. For instance, racing and light gun (rail shooters) play better on the Wii, because of the Wii Wheel and precise Wii aim motion controls respectively. A lot of Playstation 3 games are 1st person shooter, which are the best on the PC with mouse and keyboard. Fighting games like Mortal Kombat are best on consoles with controllers etc.

Playstation is the most normal console out of the big 3, the joystick-controller feels similar to the old consoles of SNES, Genesis, Saturn, etc. Also the Playstation brand has been around awhile.

Price-wise
$500.00 PS3
$250.00 Wii
$250.00 Xbox 360

The prices above vary depend on the model or whether USED or NEW. But you could get an Xbox 360 and a Wii for the price of a PS3. I've never tried Xbox before but the controller is awkward and weird looking, unfamiliar. A lot of people get the PS3 just for the Blu Ray. But for mainly gamers, the games are most expensive on the PS3.

For me I would prefer the PS3 over Microsoft's Xbox 360, because of the more familiar controller and the fact it has been around longer and for me personally, beat out my Sega Saturn along time ago. However the Blu Ray addition seems to make everything PS3 way more expensive... Now I got to pay more for every game than the Wii and Xbox360's versions!?

So why get a PS3 over an Xbox 360 and a Wii (combined)? Blu-ray, controller, dependable.

My recommendation is get an Xbox 360 and Wii over the PS3. Xbox360 games used and new are a lot cheaper than PS3 counterparts. And Wii is one of a kind.

For the money, you should also consider upgrading your PC. Especially if you are into First Person Shooter or Real Time Strategy games, since they're the best on the PC. The PC has tons of games (16,950 listed on Amazon). And it never goes out of date, as opposed to consoles that get dated. Another boon is the vast amount of demos. However, some games make you connect to the internet; software and hardware compatibly may be an issue. But you use your PC for other things, not just gaming.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_178?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=178&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Lets start with its price. It costs only $250 at any store while the XBOX360 and PS3 are putting their price over the limit for their so called revolutionized graphics. The Wii dosent have the best graphics, but it also dosent have the worst. The graphics are by ATI  which makes the picture very nice and more than decent. The Wii is also very well known for their newest approuch to gaming.  The Wii's controller development makes gaming more fun and gives you a felling like you are in the game! The Wii's small size is very unique compared to the gigantic X360 and PS3, and makes it very easy to store in many places. Also dont forget about the games; there will be new games that appear non Nintendoish with blood and gore like in Manhunt2. Other great releases will be out like SuperSmashBrotherBrawl, Zelda: Twilight Princess, and many many more! Therefore, this is why the Wii... ROCKS!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_239?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=239&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Gamers like myself grew up on the NES because the games are fun, period. The Wii willplay all the Gamecube games and most peripherals as well.

It's a great system to have groups of people playing together, creating a fantastic environment for social gaming, and at least Twilight Prinecss has just wowed this Zelda fan to even more loyalty.

The remotes do take some getting used to and it often feels the gyroscopes are a little off, but overall a novel idea.  The batteries die very quickly though so it might be best to invest in some good rechargable sets.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_246?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=246&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Great for all types of gamers.","January 15, 2010","We have had our Wii for about a year and a half now and it is fantastic. This is the 2nd console we've owned (first was the PlayStation One), and we have enjoyed using it since the day we got it.

Out of the box you'll get one Nunchuk and Wii Remote, plus Wii Sports. I suggest you promptly buy at least one additional set of controllers to take advantage of the party/group games, as well as getting rechargeable batteries of the controls. That way you won't have to worry about replacing them so often; just charge them up and you're set.

In terms of games, this system is marketed as a family-oriented, party/group gaming-centric console and as of late, a way of getting your daily exercise. This is certainly true. When family and friends come over, those of whom don't play video games whatsoever enjoy playing the Wii. Wii Sports is always a fun game to start out with, but other good group games are Mario Kart, Wii Sports Resort, and Big Brain Academy (for my family at least). It is certainly a good console if you have more ""casual"" gamers in your family/group of friends. There are TONS of games out there that cater to that type of gamer, so you'll be able to find the game you're looking for. As far as an exercise system, there are also many, many great Wii games for exercise, including Wii Fit and EA Sports Active. It really depends on what you use the Wii for, though. I don't consider myself a hardcore gamer, nor is my demographic the majority (18 year-old female), but I do enjoy a challenging game every now and then, as well as the more casual ones I could play for a couple of minutes. The Wii fits the bill for me, as far as gaming consoles. Some of the more mature titles for Wii that I've played are Resident Evil 4, No More Heroes, and Red Steel, all which I thought were great games. But some of my other favorites on the Wii are Cooking Mama and Wii Sports Resort. The Wii really offers a lot, and there are some great, more mature titles out there.

As far as controls, I enjoy the Wii Remote & Nunchuk combination. It is comfortable to use with most games and easy to get used to. At times I do miss the traditional controllers, like what the PS1 had, but even my family and friends find the Wii Remote/Nunchuk easy to use. You'll be surprised at how fluid the controllers work for first person shooters, action games, and casual games, depending on how well implemented they are into the gameplay.

All in all, the Wii is great! We don't get to use it much during the school year, but when my family/friends have some time to spare, the Wii definitely keeps us entertained.

Game suggestions: New Super Mario Bros., Mario Kart, Wario Ware: Smooth Moves, Wii Sports Resort, Cooking Mama, Big Brain Academy, Resident Evil 4, No More Heroes, Just Dance","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_176?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=176&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The gaming interaction with the wii is just priceless. Reminds me of the old days of ""Tetris"" and being absolutely psyched with our Atari! The entire family played the sports package...very, very fun. My 14 year old loves the Zelda Game and Red Steel.

A few of the things to know: The package comes with a controller and a Nunchuck. You need both for most games. Using these is a breeze, btw... there's a trigger button that is very easy to learn. (I even started bowling like a pro on this!) It is better to have 2 sets of controllers to play things like golf so you don't have to keep passing them back and forth.

Set up was so simple. 2 plugs, and you're done. It's a good looking little console as well. Another feature is the ability to ""make"" your character your own. Give yourself a name and you are good to go. (it's called making your ""mii"" --get it!?)

Something I didn't know was that if you have wireless you can hook directly to the net and store pictures and game with other players. Your characters can take part in wii ""parades"".

Best system yet. Love it.It will also get your little gamer (or yourself) off the couch for a bit!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_203?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=203&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm a 29 year old man who grew up with my Nintendo.  The ability to play those games on which I wasted hours in my youth was one of the key to making this decision as a game system instead of the xBox 360 or the PS3.

Don't get me wrong, I love my Wii console.  It's sleek, stylish and you can do so many different things on it besides playing games (voting, going online, etc).  But give us some games that are fun, please!  I can't wait for Smash Bros. and Mario Party 8 but what am I to play for now?  The console was made for both casual and hardcore gamers.  I suppose I am more of a casual player.  I never really got into Zelda: TP, TH Downhill Jam, Super Monkey Ball, or Wii Play.

I'd say Wii Sports is pretty good, but you can only play that so long.  I would no doubt buy a Wii Sports 2 if they sold it.  And they don't even have to add different games to it.  Just improve on the ones already there.  I'd gladly shell out $30 or $40.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_205?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=205&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The system will shut itself off if it overheats.  Good games we found are Wii sports (came with ours), golf - Tiger Woods 2009 ($60) is great, and the nephew likes Lego BatMan and StarWars.  The minicopter ($30) game stinks.  You'll probably want at least one extra controller/nunchuk ($40+$20).

I grew up playing a lot of family games, board games, card games, etc. It was a great way for the family to interact and get together and bond. It seems those days are few and far between....almost gone. My kids play some games, but most of there friends just play video games. We got this with the thought that the kids would be able to play more with their friends. We have found that many of the games are geared towards the family and are a lot of fun. Wii Sport is a game we play most often. Wii Fit is probably second. Just these two games are worth buying this system. Also, the fact that you can browse the internet, etc., makes this a no brainer. If you are looking for the hottest graphics, etc., then an XBOX or PS3 is probably better, but if you have you kids, and/or you are looking for fun things to play, this is the system for you. There are plenty of interactive, sports, non-violent, educational, etc., games that should satisfy everyone. I would recommend getting rechargeable batteries, or else you will go through a ton of batteries very quickly. It will save you a bundle!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_181?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=181&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have about 20 games to date and my whole family enjoys each and every one of them (ok, I like the first person shooters and they like Wii Sports) in one way or another.  Watching this system in action keeps us all entertained!

The WIImote is revolutionary!  No wires to tie you down!

The graphics are perfectly fine because once you get into the gaming experience they take a back seat to the controller.

My parents are in their 60's and were up till 3AM playing the WII!!!

Does anybody else's gaming system entice grandparents to stay up till 3AM?  Doubtful...

The hardcore gamer who is accustomed to his 700 dollar graphics card/cards in his gaming hotbox will scoff at the WII.  Rightly so!

The Wii sets the tone for the ""next generation"" of games without really changing their graphical output. Instead Nintendo used innovation in the controller to take the same image quality to the next level. They filled a niche with this system that many didn't know existed. The Wii Sports game that came with the system is a lot of fun, although grows repetitive over time. I was quickly able to bring my Wii Fitness Age (a feature of the game) down below my actual age. The boxing, tennis and bowling are all excellently done. The baseball and the golf are inferior in my opinion, but they were free with the system so I won't complain. If you can find one, pick a Wii up, even if you have any of the other next-gen systems. This will only compliment it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_196?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=196&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'll just relate how my kids (and some of mine) responded to Wii.  One word: FUN. Kids loves it. The very first game they played was the Wii Sport boxing. You won't belive how they were ""in"" the game. They were boxing each other with an extra set of Remote and the Nunchuck, and they kept getting closer and closer to the TV, I was afraid they were going to punch the TV itself. First I put down some seat cushions on the floor and told them not to cross the ""line of death."" Didn't work. They kept punching and walking closer to the TV. Finally I had to laid myself down on the floor (not to block the sensor) to keep them from approaching the TV. Kids loved the play, using their arms with the remote, and unconsicously with their feet, too. It gave a good physical work out for the kids as well - big plus for me.

The remote opened a new dimension in game play. Don't be fooled by the saying the Wii is for the casual gamers, girls, or senior citizens.  Wii Sport and early games are just a beginning slavo - for people to get used to the new controls. IMHO, Nintendo's strategy is to hook the ""casual"" gamers first, and then push for the serious gamer later. Given the motion-sensitive Remote and the Nunc, you CAN create very sophisciated  games targeted for hardcore gamers. If the strategy work out well, Sony and Microsoft will have to come out with their motion-sensitive controls and follow suit - late in the game. Yes, graphics from PS3 and XBox are stunning, but game-play is/will be the King. Currently Wii may seem to target the ""casual/young/senior/female"" players. However, the Wii Remote technology CAN be used for games with game-play targeting the hardcore gamers. PS3 and XBox focus too much on technology and visual, Wii focues on human aspects of fun.  PS3 and XBox better have a strategy to counter Wii. There will always more people who will go for ""Fun"" than ""Tech.""

BTW, my 7 yr-old killed me in boxing. KO in 2nd round. I will switch the Remote I was using with hers. I think the 2nd Remote is somehow biased. Make sure you have a lot of rooms for the kids during play. They almost punched each other's fists.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_213?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=213&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Butzin","Great fun, although used less than I had anticipated.","December 4, 2010","I bought this last Christmas for my wife, who I thought had hinted that she wanted one.

Well, it turns out that it was more for me than for her (although she loves bowling).

Set up is easy, and the unit is well designed. It fits in unobtrusively next to our large screen High Definition TV. The sound is also excellent with my high end, add-on TV sound system. I bought several accessories, including the Tiger Woods game (for my wife the golfer, albeit before his fall from grace. She refuses to play it for reasons of infidelity. Go figure!). I also bought the balance board and a couple of extra Wii controllers.

This is great fun, but I find that I don't use it very much. If I were younger (I'm 66.) and had a young family, or my grandchildren lived closer, I'd probably use it much more.

I also installed the free Netflix add-on (which requires a Netflix account to view movies via the Wii.) Although this works fine, be forewarned that the Wii is not HD. The picture quality is certainly good, but not High Definition. If you are interested in this use for the product, I'd stick with the HD Roku box. But then again, you're not buying the Wii to view movies:  that's just an additional benefit.

I've read positive reviews of the Microsoft product that has recently come out. It appears to take the Wii to the next level and may be the next big computer game hit.

Wii Sports and Wii Fit (that comes with the balance board) are fun, challenging and loaded with a variety of experiences.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_178?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=178&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But when my girlfriend and I got a tip from a work friend that a local Target was receiving a shipment of Wiis, we decided to just go for it and see if we could get one. We got there only about half an hour early. There were only a total of three of us waiting for four Wiis so we had a fun time chatting and it was a very pleasant experience. When we were able to purchase our Wii, we also decided to get an extra remote + nunchuck.

It took very minimal time to set up. The only difficult part was getting the Wii to connect to my wireless network which is secured with WPA2 security. After a quick adjustment in my router's settings it was able to connect.

The unit is amazing. It is friendly (as the girlfriend often describes it,  'cute'), the controls take a little getting used to but it has been more fun than I could have ever imagined. Wii Sports is a blast and tennis is my personal favorite. My girlfriend loves boxing because frankly, she's gotten the hang of it and I haven't, yet. You can really have a workout just playing Wii Sports!

Now we've started to expand into the Virtual Console titles, Super Mario Bros, Mario Kart 64, Donkey Kong Country, which cost about $5-10 USD each. Of course you have to buy either the classic controllers or Gamecube controllers to play most of these games, but we're definitely getting our money's worth.

The Wii has been one of the best and most rewarding investments we've made in a while. It's a console to above all, have fun. And we do!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_202?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=202&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So here we go:

I had a few concerns going into the purchase, but I loved the idea behind the wiimote so much that I was willing to buy one anyway.  Am I ever glad I did.  My two major concerns were (a) would the remote be responsive enough and (b) would I be able to play it with my projector- because I wouldn't be able to stand right in front of the screen- and play as well as a person with a traditional style television.  It turns out that the remote is incredibly responsive.  The games I've played so far have been great, and wii sports (which is just a simple little free demo) is great.  It's fun and it really makes you feel like you're part of the game.  The projector hasn't been a problem- the system can detect me at various places in the room.  Also, I think I should make a comment on the overall design; the console is small, sleek, and pretty enough to leave out on a shelf, and the remote is perfectly sized, weighted, and designed (the layout of the buttons).  I was surprised it fit my hand so well given that I'm over 6'2"" and have fairly large hands, but it worked as well for me as it did for my 13 year old brother-in-law.

Which brings me to my final comment- my brother-in-law.  He went with me to pick up my system (because my wife didn't want to stay up late for the midnight release), but he made it very clear that he was a Sony guy.  He even argued with the people in the store when we were grabbing our wii.  Then something amazing happened- he actually played some of the games.  By the time he left a few hours ago he was saying ""I gotta get this for Christmas.""  If that doesn't tell you that this system is good, then I don't know what will.  Get one for yourself, you won't be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_215?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=215&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Wii is the only major system with motion-sensing technology. It's true, some games (mostly continuations of older series), don't take advantage of the new technology and can be played with a regular gamecube controller, but many are so unique to the system that X-Box 360 and PS3 games just seem like old news. The addition of the ""nunchuck"" also gives the Wii a new touch that makes it unique from the other systems. The fact that you have a wiimote in one hand and a nunchuck in the other gives all kinds of new opportunities for unique gaming experiences. The system can be set up in 5 minutes, it's so easy; wireless internet is a plus, but isn't required to play; a charger for the wiimotes is a good idea if you're buying this as a gift because they run on 2 AA batteries; another wiimote is a must (plus another nunchuck because it's tough to play with just one); the WiiSports game that's included is fun, but buying a game is a good idea, such as:
Super Smash Bros. Brawl
The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess
Super Mario Galaxy
which are games that any Wii-owner should have. As for the graphics, the games so far haven't boasted the best graphics but Nintendo is currently working on that, planning great visual effects in games in the near future. There is so much to come for this system, they're constantly coming up with new and unique games and accessories for it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_199?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=199&reviewerType=all_reviews"

pros: inexpensive gaming console
loads of fun to play
the sports game it comes with can keep you busy for hours, a few months later and we still play it together as a family.
good customer service

cons: the controller takes a while to get used to--but when you do get used to it, it is no longer a con but a pro--because this is the best setup ever.
games are a bit pricey but thats how all game systems are when they come out, make sure you try games before you buy or at least read many reviews as it really sucks to put out 50 bucks on a game that isnt good.
the batteries in the wii mote run out and you will have to have spare aa batteries on hand, to overcome this it is easier to get rechargeable batteries or the wiis charger and stand.
pay an extra 40 bucks per controller and 20 for nunchucks x3.

overall we love our wii, even though we had to send it in. but since we got it back, the games load tons faster than they did before.

if you register your wii on nintendo.com they extend your warranty by 3 months so instead of 1 year you will get 15 months. nintendo has excellent customer service but i highly recommend anyone who has a wii to register it so they will have their warranty in place just in case. also check your game discs often to make sure the system isnt messing up your games ie circular scratches. i am sending my game back in again to nintendo, and hopefully they will return it fixed or replaced. will update when this happens.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_193?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=193&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The controller is different but easy to get used to. The only downfall i have on the Wii is that there are still not a big selection of games on it.  There is no online play (from what i have seen) and the sensor can be a pain to set up if you don't have a good amount of room to play.

EVERYONE loves playing with the Wii, from our 4 year old all the way up to Mom & Dad.  I personally am amazed at the workout I get from playing tennis and boxing.  It was easy to set up and we were playing within minutes of taking it out of the box.  There is a learning curve for some of the games that mostly has to do with learning how to use the controllers.  But if you have a young kid in your house, just ask them because I guarantee they've already figured it out and will stand behind you while you're playing to tell you what you're doing wrong :P  We can't wait to add more games (we only have Wii Sports, which came with it, Mario vs Sonic Olympics which is a MAJOR workout and Ninjabread Man).  The box included the Wii console, one Wii Remote, one Wii Nunchuk, an adaptor to plug the console in to the power outlet, and some other important electronic stuff that I can't think of the names of right now.  It also included Wii Sports, which we all think is lots of fun as we can play tennis, golf, baseball, boxing, bowling, do a fitness challenge and there's even an area to practice the skills of all of those sports.  Each person can create their own ""Mii"" which is an entire separate review.  I'm now trying to figure out how to play ""real time"" with other friends who have Wii's that live across the country and in Europe.  We were able to snag one of these on amazon for the regular price (through some creative but perfectly legal and ethical methods), so even though we LOVE our Wii, I'd hold off on paying the over-inflated prices that resellers are offering to sell the Wii. And another cool thing?  If you have a gamecube, all of your gamecube games and the controllers work with the wii too!  We've even found that some of the games that wouldn't play on the gamecube any longer (because maybe someone wasn't CAREFUL about putting them away and they got roughed up a little) now work in the Wii.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So far, the Wii has easily gone far beyond my expectations. Within hours of obtaining my Wii, I knew Nintendo had really struck gold here. Its one thing to say, ""This game looks real,"" and quite another to state, ""this feels real.""

Wii Sports, which comes with the Wii, is the perfect way to introduce people to the Wii. This simplistic looking game can be overlooked, but I'm positive I, along with many others, will remember the first time they played Wii Sports, and that's really saying something. From the time you first swing your tennis racket (wiimote), to the time you throw your first jab or uppercut, you will be hooked, and you will comeback for more. I could go on and on about the Wii, but you truly have to experience it yourself. Whether you're playing Wii Sports, Madden, or Zelda, your experience will never be the same again.

However, Wii is meant to be enjoyed by multiple players. Pick up an extra Wiimote and Nunchuck when you purchase your Wii. Furthermore, make sure you have plenty of space to play and get ready for a workout.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_204?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=204&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When i searched teh internet i found so many people had the same issue. Since we liked the Wii, we decided to get a replacement unit. The replacement also had same issues as teh first one. But unlike the first one the second ejected the CDs after couple of tries.

Returning back for refund now.

Other things you might want to consider.

#1
By default you will get only composite output cable (1 Video + 2 Audio). The new LED TV i bought Sharp 46LE810UN just have only one composite input and i have also noticed that the 2010 model TVs are reducing their composite input and increasing the HDMI input. Though you can buy the Wii component cable (3 Video + 2 Audio) from the market, it is very disappointing to see that Wii does not have HDMI out by default.

#2
Would be better if the Wii has a hard power off switch. Not sure whether this is teh cause of the Game CDs get struck when left it in the console for a long time. Also, the weird thing is that if you do not completely shut off the Wii, the Game CD input CD blinks occasionally.

#3
Wish we could have a remote recharge option available from the console or as additional accessory.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_173?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=173&reviewerType=all_reviews"

And while most of the games are arcade-ish, they're entertaining for anybody who does not call himself a hardcore gamer.  If you're looking for realistic, movie-like graphics, get an Xbox 360 or a PS3.  But if you want a system that people of all ages will enjoy, get a Wii.

That said, there is also a downside to the Wii.

While the games are fun, many of them get old in a hurry.  With the exception of Mario Kart, which I'm pretty much up for playing at any time, the games I've purchased at the store have all been at least decent and I enjoy them for a week after purchase, but then they collect dust for months until I have interest in playing them again.  It would be acceptable if the games were less expensive, but dropping $40 on a game that grows old quickly is not a mistake a Wii gamer will make too many times.  I feel like I need a couple dozen games to keep me playing Wii every day.  And for that to happen, I would need to see most games at $15-20 and premium games like Madden NFL 10 at $30.

Many of the games you'd like to play online, such as Wii Sports (we all think we're the best at power bowling), are not available for online play.  There are hundreds of games to purchase online inexpensively (including classics like Super Mario Bros and Tecmo Bowl), but unfortunately there is no option to try before you buy and I've regretted buying every title except the classics mentioned above and Tetris Party (you can play Tetris online).

There are many benefits to having your Wii connected to the Internet (I use my wireless signal).  In addition to being able to play and buy many games online, you can also download: Nintendo Channel, which has video clips and lots of other valuable information if you're looking to buy Wii or DS games; the Everybody Votes Channel, where you pick an answer and predict the most popular answer (i.e., ""Would you rather do dishes or laundry?""); Internet Channel, which allows you to browse the Internet; and you can check the news and your local weather forecast.

The Wii also seems to have the least negative feedback regarding console durability and performance of any gaming console on the market.  I'm knocking on wood with one hand while I type that I've had my console for nearly one year and I've had zero freezes or other issues.

While the Wii has its share of short-comings, the Wii is a great buy if you're looking for a family console.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_175?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=175&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But, add me to the legions that are sold on the Wii. The controls just seem to make sense, even with very little practice. The games are fun, and it's a great alternative to watching writer-less TV. The Girlfriend and I realised quite soon after installing it that a second Wiimote and nunchuck are musts, even with the included Wii Sports. It gets tiresome to swap the Wiimote back and forth on games like Bowling, which moves pretty quickly. Graphics quality is quite good, if not up to the HD par of the PS3.

Serra","Wii console","October 11, 2008","I bought this console 6 days ago and I am really exited about it, along with two games to start playing with it, I already know system configurations and how this console works overall, I will focus my review on only the limitations I could notice so far:

*Channel switching: If you are reviewing games on the Wii Shop channel, you probably want to see a video review of the games you are interested in, you will have to go back to Home Menu and enter the Nintendo Channel (which is free for download). So switching back and forth from channels is slow, and you can't have more than one channel open (the one you are in). Including Wii games (which it is a channel itself) you can't suspend your games to quick check the weather update (for example), only games you can do that is on NES games which is obvious as it is the only way to save your progress.

*Wii Shop channel and Everybody's votes channel availability): If you live in a country currently not supported for these channels, prepare yourself for major disappointment. Even wii points card are for sell in my country, I must set the Wii in USA in order to enjoy all benefits of wii shop.

*Wi-Fi reach: I find this console to have a short range of wireless reception signal, my laptop is very close to where I have the console right now and it gets the wireless-g signal from my wireless router upstairs very good, I get a lot of connection problems with my Wii, sadly I can't help it because I can't move the TV from its current location, only solution is to move the router closer to the Wii, which I will try anytime soon.

Other than that, I am really exited about my shop and plan to buy more games and more controls as I become able to afford it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_178?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=178&reviewerType=all_reviews"

O'Connor","Not another mom review!","November 29, 2008","Yep, I am yet another mom who bought the Wii to get my son up off the couch.  And I am so glad that I did!  My 6 year old son loves the video game console, and there are plenty of games that he is able to navigate more or less on his own.

I read reviews of EVERYTHING before I buy and am more than grateful to the Amazon community for providing endless reviews on anything I might want.  BUT, I am so tired of reading ""gamers"" reviews of the Wii and criticizing the moms of Amazon for buying our kids the Wii.  I am thankful that we live in a world where video games are designed for KIDS too!

We love to play Wii sports together!  My son is sometimes physically tired before the game is even over, but always comes back for more!  I've even been playing tennis and boxing after he's in bed at night!  The workout is no exchange for riding bikes at the park or playing an actual game of baseball, and it certainly holds no candle to a trip to the gym.  But it does have that video game feel to it that keeps us coming back for more!

We have other games too.  We love the Wii-mote sensor controls!  It's so much more fun to swing the remote as a sword or flick it up to throw a ball than to simply press a button.  Well, for a mom and kid anyway.  Maybe not those hard core gamers out there!  ;)

An added bonus is that the Wii is compatible with GameCube games.  You just have to buy the gamecube controller.  We were able to purchase many used games at a much cheaper rate than any Wii game out there.

The Wii is a great addition to any family friendly home!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_205?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=205&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's best feature in my eyes is the fact that many of the games expect you to be more interactive, than your standard game where you sit and do nothing but become involved in a game.

I can see why hard core gamers may criticize the console, because they have high expectations from the other two systems out on the market. What makes the Wii unique is that it caters to both hard core games and those wanting a quick diversion. There are games to meet both type of users.

The different remotes and the physical interaction make this possibly one of the most unique systems out there. I know gamers may expect the high resolution pictures and intense gaming experiences, but if you're looking for something new, a console that allows for group players, or wish to experience the physical games such as Wii Sports and Wii Fit Plus, you will not be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_186?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=186&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I want a gaming system that I don't have to be a ""hardcore gamer"" to enjoy.

The Wii incorporates everything I loved about their previous systems into the Wii. Easy controls, good graphics (slightly better than the PS2 & Xbox), and unique features like the Miis, the weather channel, the virtual console, and last but not least the stunning ""Wiimote"" controller.

The Xbox is a professional deal, no doubt.  You can do all sorts of things like download movies (HD ones too), games, all sorts of things like that.  The graphics are insane and the games hard core.  So when I got a Wii recently it felt a lot like going back in time to the days when I owned a Nintendo 64.  The sophistication of this thing is that old.  They really put out a no frills model with the Wii.

On the other hand, they got it right.  When my brother and his two kids visited we found ourselves having a blast playing games. My brother worked  up a major sweat doing the boxing.  This is a great family console.  All I've played is the sports games on the demo disk but that's enough of a novelty that I'm satisfied.  The controller is a cool idea, it's not 100% precision but neither are the games.

Nelson","Fun for the whole family and great controls","February 2, 2008","The Nintendo Wii is great! While the graphics are not as good as the Xbox 360 or the PS3, game play and controls more than make up for it.  In my family, we cover the spectrum of gaming: from my brother and I, who have owned and/or played on almost every system since the original Nintendo, to my wife's grandmother and my in-laws who had never played a video game.  Everyone loved it!

The best feature is the sensitivity of the controls to movement, especially in games like Madden '08 Wii Sports.  A slight twist of the wrist, or a shake of the Wii remote or the nunchuck and the games respond like real life.  Beware though, you may have sore muscles you didn't know you had!

A few favorite games:

Madden '08 - Classic Madden game play combined with the controls of the Wii make this one hard to stay away from.  My brother had a hard time going back to the 360, in spite of better graphics because of the realism the controls add to the game.

Zelda - As opposed to some RPGs (role-playing games), Zelda seems to stretch on for a long time.  Even with a walkthrough guide, I would guess you would need to put in 30 hours minimum to beat the game. More realistically, it will take closer to 40-50 hours.  A dollar an hour seems well worth it to me.  Zelda combines the usual ""fight the bad guy"" stuff with some riddle-type puzzles throughout the game.  There are also hidden items throughout the map (bugs, treasure chests, secret caves, etc).

Super Mario Galaxy - This is the next great game in the Mario series.  It is the new, improved Super Mario 64.  As the name indicates, this one takes place in space (different planets are different levels).  It doesn't seem quite as difficult as the N64 version, but you will still put in a lot of time on this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_188?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=188&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However we haven't seen any groundbreaking games that change the game play experience in any of the new, next generation systems. Nintendo is betting that the change won't be graphical but instead based on new peripherals such as the motion sensing Wii remote.

This remote shows ingenuity, but is not as impressive as one would think. It doesn't seem that the Wii Remote senses true 3d motion. What is meant by that (Check my Amazon profile because I discuss it on my website.) is when you swing it doesn't record the 3d position of your arm, instead it just records the swing as a slash motion in most games. That is so that when you swing you sword in Zelda: Twilight Princess the character (Link) just swings his sword. It is not like you are involved in a 3d sword battle. FPS shooters are another area where a standard controller is needed. It is too difficult to navigate the area.

The system does has its strengths. It is the best system for kids. It is the cheapest system. And Nintendo is known for making some of the best games.

The best games I've played so far have been group/party games (Wii Sports, Party Games) and driving games (Need for Speed).  I've not been overly thrilled with the games available, though.  I'm pretty dissapointed most every time I rent a game.  Seems only 1 out of 4 are fun.

The system also povides good excercise.  Really helps prevent the normal lazy gaming style (lounging around on the couch all day).  I actually work up a sweat every time I play tennis!

It's an awesome machine.  When I first started it up I plopped on the couch, expecting to be all comfy and lazy while I played.  Well, that didn't last long!  Nearly every game I have for the Wii requires me to stand up and move.

The only bad thing to say about it is that the remote doesn't detect movement in REAL 3d space.  I figured out that I could pitch a ball by swinging my arm backwards instead of forwards.  There's several other games with similiar little glitches like that.

Overall, however, the Wii is great fun.  Even if the sensor bar confuses my motions, the fact that the Wii forces me to move makes me love it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Whenever we have guests over to the house it is in constant use. From Wii Sports, to Wii Play, to Mario Party, to Bomberman downloaded from the Virtual Console.

It's great for birthday parties, Thanksgiving, and other times you get together with friends. It just kind of draws a crowd.

There are also a lot of fun single player games as well such as Zelda, Paper Mario, Metroid, etc.

If you want a system for Group fun. We have both a Wii and a XBOX 360. The perfect combo for all range of games.

If I were to just have one though, it would be the Wii due to the fact I do not have the time to play a lot of video games and I usually play with friends when they come over. Though online play with friends is great with the XBOX 360, I'm more of the type of guy who enjoys seeing the face of the person I am beating at tennis.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_194?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=194&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Wii is very family oriented and my 7 year old loves it.  It's a great game system for the 2 of us to play together.  I love the fact that every game is so interactive.  You don't just sit on the couch and play mindlessly.  You are actually involved in every game.  I just love getting up and moving and being part of everything.

Rogers","Two Words...Simply Awesome!!!!","December 31, 2007","I got our Wii as a Christmas Present for the whole family, I had seen the commercials and read the reviews. Niether of which do this System any justice whatsoever. From the first game we played on Christmas morning my family has been in love with the Wii!!! I hadn't been interested in even touching a video game since I had a Sega Genesis many years ago. Yesterday I spent about three hours playing Wii Sports by myself. The kids have played all the other systems and we do own a PS2 and an Xbox, but my wife and I, and even my Dad(who's in his 60's)have had a blast playing the Wii. The controllers are super simple, for example, to play Tennis on Wii Sports all you have to do is swing the remote. Can it get any easier to play a video game? For the more adventurous, you can learn how to move the controller to change the way you swing, or learn to serve an Ace by hitting the ball just right. We also purchased several other games to go with our system. All of them just as fun, and all unique in their style of play. The Wii is simply unlike any other video game ever made. I do feel that having a full complement of 4 Wii Remotes and 4 Nunchuks, while expensive, is a must for a family to fully enjoy this wonder. Every game we have played has filled our living room with infectious laughter and absolute excitement. I recommend this system for anyone who longs to have that old fashioned ""Family Game Night"" with a 21st Century twist. Our family hasn't hung out together like this EVER!! No matter what the kids say, skip the expensive Xbox 360 and PS3 and Go Wii. Connecting the Wii to the Internet is wireless, all you need is a wireless router and follow the connection instructions, and unlike Xbox and PS3 the internet on the Wii is free. I could go on and on, but I'm sure you probably want to get on with purchasing your own Wii at this point. Happy gaming!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_216?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=216&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have about ten titles for the Nintendo Wii, including Rock Band and Guitar Hero III.  I landed Guitar Hero for Easter, and landed Rock Band for my 39th Birthday.

I feel that the Wii is simply amazing and fun.  The arcade quality graphics and sound are incomparable to earlier Nintendo platforms.  Goodbye plastic cartridges, hello CD-ROM disks.

Nintendo will make sure that you get a great system, awesome graphics, and most importantly it is affordable. Due to the fact the system is just a video game and doesn't have a dvd player, or the other fancy things the other systems have, helps to keep the system affordable to those that can't drop $600 to $800 for one of the other systems. There are a few good titles that the wii has now, like Zelda, and Red steel. Once more games are released this system is going to be even better.

2:  Fully functioning interaction.  Just play Tiger Woods 07 or Madden 07 and you will see what I am talking about.

3:  For everyone.  This system is good for everyone.  My wife hates video games, but surprisingly she loves Wii-sports bowling.

4:  Games are cheaper and the console itself is a bargain.

5.  The Virtual Console is packed full of awesome old time favorites.  I just downloaded Bonk's Adventure, Kirby, and Shockman the other day from the Wii shopping channel.  (you have to pay for them)

5:  If you are a hardcore gamer get a PS3 or 360.  If you are looking from something imaginative and fun for everyone one to play and your on a budget get a Wii.

I love mine, but I also have a 360 for those hard core titles like Gears of War.  Both together still cost me less than a PS3.

6.  Lastly, if you get a Wii, go a head and at least purchase the virtual console controller and the wireless connection thumb drive.  You definitely need to go on line with it to get all the channels and updates.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_184?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=184&reviewerType=all_reviews"

You are not going to be disappointed. If you were an Avid PS2 or Xbox player, and your picky about graphics ,frame rate and how realistic it looks when something  blows up...then you might want to consider the Wii as a second system.
I own 19 games for the Wii... and so far have played only a handful ( I am a addict...I have to buy the latest titles...its stupid, but then its a lot cheeper than some of the toys my peers are buying, so my wife puts up with it...)
I am being honest with you, few games are as good as they could be...but I know that the best games are always the last 2 years of the systems life..
The Wii controls are great, but it really depends on how well the game developer incorperates them into the game.  Zelda is very nice...Blazing Angels is good...Excite Truck is very cool!
If you are upset because you cannot find a Wii yet...don't worry...the best games have not even hit the shelves.
I am not going to go over how fun it is and all the hype, because, its been said before...Yes, its a new experience and Non-Games Love it...but the truth is, I am still playing my GameCube more that my Wii...
And the reason is because the greatest games for the gamecube are selling for 1/3rd the price that they originally were..and these games are the best that the game cube can handle... Once there are some more mature games on the market, I am sure that I'll be useing the Wii more than my Gamecube.

Warnings:
Cooking Momma for the Wii-- Don't bother -They did not bother to get someone to translate effectively...the result? If you do something that Cooking Momma likes...she says ""Good, not mine!"" What does that mean????
MY wife is Japanese and a translator...she even admits that they should not have released it without a proper translation.
VVVONDERfool!

Marvel Aliance -I would pass, its not really good or bad, but nothing is amazing as far as using the Wii controls...etc.

SuperMonkey Ball..Not a bad game ..but not as good as the gamecube version...

Wear your safety Straps....its not an option to play without it!

Titles to watch for this year:
Mario Party 8
Metroid Prime
Super Smash Brawl
Resident Evil 4","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_184?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=184&reviewerType=all_reviews"

AND rechargable batteries are a must!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_228?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=228&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If Nintendo would clamp down and prevent bad games from being published I would have more respect for this console.  I own a Wii and a PS3.  The novelty of the motion controller wears off and both 360 and ps3 have one coming.  A game doesn't have to have the best graphics (Zelda) to be good and it is way too far between a Galaxy or Zelda.  I barely touch the Wii and even though I don't own one, I would recommend someone by an Xbox 360 over a Wii if they want to get more value for their money. A lot of people weren't around when the 2600 came out.... and left.  Look up rhe wiki entry of shovelware. Nintendo needs to learn from Atari.  We study history so we don't repeat it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_165?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=165&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Horsley","I am a Wii Convert!!!","July 6, 2007","Wasn't really interested when the Wii first came out, kind of thought it was going to be like GameCube and only for kids.  Let's face it, after Playstation 1 came out, I never thought I'd own a video game console made by any other company except Sony.  But then, Sony had to go and turn its back on people who have been supporting it for so long,focusing more on keeping up with its competiton (Microsoft)than it did on making its loyal customers happy. First by charging the rediculous price for its PS3 console, and second by not realizing that people who had PS1's all those years ago have grown up, gotten jobs, had families, and now play games mostly for recreation. We do not have the time to get killed 55 times while trying to complete a single level, nor do many of us have the inclination to play on-line with a bunch of kids who have nothing else to do in their day than play Resistance Fall of man, and who obliterate us the second we come on-line. Not to mention that when my three year-old is awake I don't like to him to see the ultra-realistic violence possible on newer systems. What ever happened to all the fun games, with quick levels that were not so easy as to be childish but were definitely achievable?  Oh, wait.... I know...they are on the Nintendo Wii!! Just got mine last night and also got Wii Play and Bust a Move and they are a blast!!  No, the graphics may not be as pretty as XBox 360 or PS3, but the cost is far more reasonable and the games are very fun.  Some of the games on Wii Play are a little strange, but they all demonstrate the capabilities of the WiiMote and most of all Wii brings the fun back into video games!
  Although I completely agree the WiiMote is VERY strange at first, it doesn't take long to get used to it.  The Wii provides helpful hints to get you started playing right away.  I am already hooked on Wii Tennis. And I even worked up a sweat, which was a unique experience whilst playing video games.  I can see that at least my right arm will be super-buff after about 6 weeks of Wii Tennis. :)
  Overall, if your entire life revolves around video games, the Wii may not be exactly what you're looking for.  But if you just play games to have a little fun and unwind after a long day, or have a family that likes to spend time playing together, the Wii may be just what you're looking for! Highly reccommended!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_197?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=197&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We use it so much that it just finally wouldn't play anymore. That's when we ordered another one from Amazon. Couldn't let a day pass without Wii!!. We had been playing the ""sports"" cd, but thought we'd try something different. We got the game of Monopoly. Mindless.Needing only a hand to play. We were skeptical, but pressed on. What the game lacks phyically, it makes up for emotionally. I have to have Boardwalk. Oh, oh, my opponent just put houses on his property. And then, there's this little man who runs around the board letting all the players know what's happening and ad-libing about the actions of the players. Like, if you want to trade with another player, he states how exciting that is for him. It's a fun, addictive game. A game for the family.

Three days ago we were in (insert retail store name here) and we saw it...The gleaming white box behind the glass...It was...WII!!!

Like so many others, we had been scouring the aisles of every store that carries it since last November and finally we reaped our reward. I think that's the only way to get it; just randomly.

Anyway, we happily took it home, brimming with the highest of expectations, and the Wii delivered!!

The Wii is truly a console for the whole family. Even our (VERY) easily frustrated four-year-old was bowling and pitching baseballs like a pro within minutes of hooking it up. That's not to say it isn't fun and challenging for parents, too. It is. In fact, I don't think the thing has been off for longer than 10 or so hours since we brought it home! We only have the Wii Sports and the one remote at the moment, but we have a second remote and a few games on order now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_203?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=203&reviewerType=all_reviews"

  For the last two years on new years eve, I watched my boyfriend and my brother play on my brother's Wii system.  I thought it was a nice game system.  He brought some fun kids games and some interesting sports games. It was so funny watching them sweat while playing games against eachother.  I used to play tennis, so I tried it for a while.  I really felt like I was on the tennis court, my arms were sore within an hour.  Then I realized this game unit had the capability to be used as an exercise machine.
  I asked my brother to borrow the Wii again for a week, but this time with the Fit Board.  I decided to try working out before bedtime three times per week for 30 minutes.  I really felt the exercise in all of my muscles as if I had been to the gym or had been working out with a personal trainer.  I decided right then and there I just had to have my own Wii.
  I purchased it and have been using it for the first two months of this year at least 6 days per week for 30 minutes to an hour.  Because it feels like a game, and not exercise, it was much easier for me to get motivated to work out.  Then I started working out right after work before dinner.  So far I have lost... 16 pounds in two months.  This motivated me to start eating right again and I haven't felt this good since I was 18 and didn't need to exercise.  At 37 years old, I never thought I could touch my toes again and feel this flexible.
  Again... This is the best purchase I ever made.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to feel fit and doesn't think they can exercise.  I had a back injury a few years ago and didn't think I would ever be able to exercise again.  There was no way I could do sit-ups.  I have been amazed that a ""game console"" could help me.

** As for the people who gave this system negative ratings because the Wii told them they were obese... get over it.  We all know we need to lose weight.  There are exercises for beginers and advanced users alike.  I am looking forward to using this everyday.  When I see my weight going down, it makes me feel so good.  Soon I will be able to fit into the clothes in the back of my closet.  I love this!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wii-Nintendo/product-reviews/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_178?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=178&reviewerType=all_reviews"
