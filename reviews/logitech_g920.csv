Not sure about negative reviews, one major thing i noticed is that no other controllers can be connected to the xbox. Initially it wasn't working looked on line looked @ logitech website no one mentions the very important single thing is to disconnect all controllers. No need to update firmware. Here is how to make it work with everything. 1) disconnect all xbox controllers 2) plug G920 adapter in wall 3) plug in G920 usb to xbox 4) wait for calibration to finish 5)press xbox button on G920 6) navigate with pad on G920 to sign in to your profile with steering wheel 7) presto it works with all my games.

Decided to give this one a go. It takes some getting used to, but no matter the FFB settings I just dont like racing with a wheel. Though I did really enjoy it in American/Euro Truck Simulator, esp with the shifter. Outside of those including Project Cars 2, Forza 7/Horizon 4, And Assetto Corsa I just couldn't really get into it. Maybe it's decades of using an analog gamepad on PC for racing games idk. I love racing games and driving in real life. Can't believe this was a buyers remorse for me.

I also didn't like the feel of the 'gears' in the wheel when turning, just felt awkward and unrealistic. Maybe a belt driven FFB wheel would have been a more realistic and better experience?","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_148?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=148&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The wheel works great and the force feedback is amazing. It is a bit noisy but I never hear it because I use a headset while racing. The pedals are very sturdy. I love having the buttons on the wheel due to the fact I can assign them for in car functions. Helps a lot not having to reach over to hit a button. Would highly recommend the G29!
**UPDATE**
Wheel has started losing calibration in game. I have tried it on different games to see if it was just a certain game but the problem continues. This should not happen to a product this expensive and only 2 months of light use. After a little research it seems I am not the only one to have this issue. I DO NOT recommend the G29. There are way better wheels on the market for this price.
**UPDATE**
After receiving a new wheel and pedals from Logitech on a warranty claim the pedals are now having an issue. The throttle pedal will not fully engage in game. I have checked for updates and even re installed software. This will be the second warranty claim in less than a year. This is a cheap made overpriced product and I DO NOT recommend buying it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_123?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=123&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This thing is an absolute blast on my PS4 with Project Cars, you really feel every little detail through the wheel, even when you go over curbing you can tell which side of the car went over it through the wheel.

I wish that I could give a 3.5 star review; the set is exceptional, but super expensive and a slight pain to get working on Windows 7 x64.

Fresh out of the box my first thoughts were that this product feels well made, it is hefty and the hand stitched leather on the steering wheel feels excellent. The pedal base has a pop out pad of spikes to keep it from moving on carpet, which I found to work quite well without it tearing up the carpet at all. It mounts easily and securely to my desk with two clamps that screw into place.

Some of the only issues I had installing the device was when I installed the Logitech Gaming Software package from the official website, and after successful installation, Windows 7 informed me it was an unsigned driver then disabled the device.  Heading back to the Logitech website I noticed under the details tab that Windows 7 users need to install a certain Windows Update, which fixed my unsigned driver issue.

The force feedback on the wheel is quite strong, and I have it turned down a bit from the default levels. The Logitech software allows full configuration of buttons as well as sensitivity levels for the wheel and pedals.

This really takes games to the next level and I highly recommend it for the serious game lover.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_152?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=152&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm using it mainly for simulation games like Euro Truck Sim 2 and Fernbus Simulator. For me, these games occasionally have trouble recognizing the wheel, but once things are set up it runs like a dream. Make sure the desk or table top you intent to mount this thing to isn't too wide - about a half- or one-inch thick table top is ideal. The construction is decent, with thick plastic, solid metals, and even a nice leather binding on the wheel.

I got it working, but the only way to get it to work is to hook it up into Xbox One & reset the Xbox One. The Xbox One works using the controllers off of the G920, but I constantly get a message on the screen telling me that the controller  has been disconnected. Also I have no way of calibrating the G920 using the Xbox as the Xbox One does not identify the G920. I can set the parameters to the G920 on the computer & did get the G920 updated, but I still can not calibrate the G920. This was suppose to be a plug & play setup. Xbox is suppose to work hand in hand & at the very least, recognize this wheel. Also when racing down the straightaway for no reason the wheel starts vibrating moving car from left to right, causing loss of control, this is frustrating as it just happens out of the blue. I let off the throttle but to no avail, an uncontrollable  crash is evidently in store. Never had this problem before using the Xbox controller. The pedals are cumbersome but work. they move across the carpet & cause issues from a stability stand point. Still waiting for the seat & wheel holder to arrive. I was able to block the pedals from moving by placing a 2 by 6 in between the legs of the table I have the Wheel & Shifter attached to. I'm sure some of the stability issues will go away once I get the seat & stand. Also ran into issues with the Amazon order & a delivery of 3 of these shifters & 2 sets of wheels & pedals. All I wanted was a bundle package with a Logictech G920 Wheel, Pedals, & a Shifter, that I had seen on Amazon .com, but when I place the original order a box was checked on the page to order only the wheel. I tried to cancel order like 3 minutes after I submit it, but was messaged that I couldn't cancel order because it was all ready processed & shipped.  ????? 3 Minute shipping is unheard of. Come on Amazon. Any way I reorder the Logitech G920 Wheel with the Pedal Box checked & wala. I get a confirmation on the second order & they tell me everything will be shipped together. O. K. I thought you just emailed me told me the original order was already shipped. Go figure. At least I had 1 extra wheel & set of pedals & 2 extra shifters incase something didn't work right. Oh well, I will be sending the extras back as they charged my card for them. :(
This was my fist eventful experience with Amazon as usually they are pretty straight forward & things go pretty smoothly. I am a first time wheel & pedal user. I have not bought this kind of stuff before, but wanted to give it a shot. Only directions or information in the box for the whole setup is a small diagram showing how to hook it up & a FCC Licensing information. Wow I can see a whole bunch of frustrated kids out there, feeling pretty fed up, & giving up on what might be something good. I did go to the Logitech Website. After spending almost an hour trolling through the web page I was able to find the Game Control Section & was able to upgrade the drivers in the G920. Now to tech support. None they run you through a bunch of hit & miss trouble shooting theory's & in the end tell you that if your G920 is not working correctly with the Xbox One to disconnect the USB Cable & simultaneously pressing the LSB button, View button, & Xbox button, plug the  USB cord back into the Xbox One. I can see that many people have accomplished this task by themselves. It may some sort of hay wired G920 reset code,  but come on guys. The tech support sucks. No phone #'s to call, no chat, no email service,  just other customers claiming to have the same problems & what they did to fix the problem. What a blogout.  I will edit the review when I see how things pan out with the returning of the unopened items. Lack of support from Logitech as they seem to figure that everybody should already know what to do when their product doesn't seem to work right. That seems to be a no-brainer.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_131?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=131&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The pedals are a strong point, they have a smooth progressive throw and unique to the Logitech system, they're mounted on a wide, solid base with a carpet grabber, rendering them usable without a simpit.

Alongside belt-based systems, the geared force feedback system used here feels rough and grindy. If I hadn't tested it alongside the Thrustmaster I think it would have felt fine

So far this thing has been great. The build feels really well and the FFB is enough to keep me satisfied. I have put this thing through hell racing dirt with sprint cars and modified on iRacing and it is holding its own. Plenty of buttons to map for ease of use in VR. The only thing I would like better is if the wheel was just a tad bigger in diameter. It does have the grindy feel due to the gear system it uses, but once you get your preferred settings in order, you can hardly tell. For the money, this wheel is by far the best you can get. Word of advice, if you are having trouble installing the Logitech software on your Windows 10 machine, unplug your optical drive prior to installing. As crazy as this sounds, it works when you run into the installation hanging up.

*Update*
After hours upon hours of use, the unit has started to make the squeaking noises that other users have mentioned. IT only seems to do it after sitting over night. Once the unit gets used and the gears get re-greased the sound seems to go away. I will eventually take the wheel apart and put some high quality airplane grease on the gears but everything seems to be in working order. I use VR with this wheel so I don't seem to notice any concerning noises coming from the unit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Bought this unit for iRacing. Other than the brake pedal being a little stiff (for which their is an easy mod to fix), it works great for Sim racing.

However, the base warranty ran out about a week ago, and the unit died almost immediately afterwards. Won’t read on a PS4, won’t read on a computer, went through the whole routine of trying to fix it through software, all to no avail.

In the end, without the ability to fix it myself, and paying for repairs being as expensive as buying a new unit, I guess it’s what I have to do.

So, great unit in terms of how it works, but buy the extended warranty.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_73?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=73&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I am extremely disappointed with the product I have recieved. I ran the wheel for about 3-4 days and it broke. The game I used this wheel with was Euro Truck Simulator 2.

The problem with my wheel is that when I turn the wheel al the way to the left and sometimes just a little bit, every single button activates at once. I did some reading and discovered this could be caused by the wires attached to the motherboard being broken around the connector causing a short/bad connection (though this is not the issue with mine). After reading that I reinstalled the drivers and did everything that might have fixed it. After a little more wheel movement the wheel is no longer memorized by my PC. Also, another very common issue is the brake pedal being extremely and unrealistically stiff. Either the brakes are barely pressed, or they're entirely applied.

Either way this wheel was poorly designed because of the wires breaking off due to not having enough slack for the wires run up to the motherboard. Also the brake pedal as mentioned. One last thing is compatibility and software. There is no way to use a ""profiler"" like previously with the G27. The G920 and G27 are only good for a few games which makes this wheel nearly pointless.

I can not recommend this wheel due to the poor design and drivers/software that is provided. I would recommend finding a different brand like Thrustmaster or similar wheels. This wheel is supposed to be PC compatible but it is far from it. Only a few games work with it and it's very difficult to keep it working properly. It is not an out of the box wheel and it does not support PC entirely as it is recognized as a controller.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_127?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=127&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I am currently using it to play American Trucking Simulator and it has made the gaming experience much better. I have tried racing wheels in the past but they always made driving much more difficult. This one has changed how I feel about racing wheels for the better. The force feedback really makes you think about how deep you should be turning the wheel when going fast. The more violent it vibrates indicates that you are risking your truck and trailer rolling over in the turn. I love the rev indicator leds as they really help get the shifting right. I also own the H-shifter which is a great addition.The number of buttons helps limit how much I need to rely on the keyboard for in game functions. You can even assign G key macro commands to any of the buttons which I use to trigger my 3 button push-to-talk for teamspeak. The volume buttons are in a great spot so I never have to reach for my keyboard volume buttons during the game. The red dial is handy as I have the transmission retarder mapped to. The bottom PS4 buttons can be used with the pc and can be programmed to do anything you need them to be. For anyone that knows LUA scripting, any button on here can but scripted just like other G key devices.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I recently purchased a Logitech G920 Driving Force Racing Wheel. I believe I have had it for about two months now. Normal usage is about 5-6 times a week( 1-2 hours at a time-if that). I have to say, this product is absolutely awful. The pedals are very sticky(brake pedal has a soft feel , then gets hard, then soft again- Almost like it has a rub somewhere in the pedal mechanism)  The accelerator pedal is way too soft and does not have much throw, the clutch pedal/accelerator both have some dead spots (calibration won’t read them accurately as they are depressed.- and yes I have updated all the drivers) And it is not very user friendly when installing on to your computer ( I had to remotely install everything several times and Google how to solve the USB issues, before I could get the product to actually function-)

Moving along to the wheel- The wheel is my least favorite part. The feel and size of the wheel is nice, however the functionality is awful. The wheel has a giant dead spot that is left of center. (I have to recalibrate this wheel every time I load up *IRACING.) This dead spot makes it nearly impossible to use. I have adjusted the sensitivity settings to try to compensate for this, it has helped but this dead spot but it is just nearly impossible to adjust for. I am not happy with this product at all.

I use many Logitech devices and are very happy with everything else I have. I really miss the G27, as this was a far better product . (even though this is based on that platform)

Hope to get a reply from the manufacture.

That wheel worked fine as it was the first to offer 900 degrees or rotation. However, the build quality of the pedals was too archaic to handle daily use and constantly had sensor issues. However, upgrading was always a big financial decision that kept me away from upgrading. Luckily this wheel went on sale and I did not hesitate in buying it.

The first major question was xbox version or ps4 version. Both work with PC but the ps4 version offers more buttons. This is a plus if you play racing sims and like to make in-car adjustments often, or race open-wheel cars like F1. However, I would take into consideration if you also play home consoles as well as PC.

The only issue I have with this wheel, and it's minor, is that when looking at the wheel you can clearly see what button is labeled what. It's easy to build muscle memory for button placement (for me it was since the placement hasn't changed much in 15yrs) but when you connect to the PC and play a racing sim I run into the same issue. Every game just lables the buttons as 1-20+. Some games identify this wheel and preset the buttons, but switching them up in the menus or trying trying to memorize what button is 12 vs when button is 5 is annoying when you realize the layout on the wheel isn't exactly  ""in order"". Buttons 1-12 flow in a nice, generalize pattern on the wheel, but once you get to around button 18 through (i think) 24.,... things start to be randomly spread around the wheel and you lose track where they are.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Don’t get me wrong, this is a fantastic wheel for the price... Especially for the casual console gamer. BUT, this in my opinion is NOT for those who are planning on getting serious on PC with simulators like iRacing, rFactor 2, or even games like PC2 and AMS where you want to be fully immersed into the race. Here’s why: The wheel is driven by gears, not belt driven.

It took a lot of hindsight to figure it out... researching types of wheels, their mechanics, features, and new tech to ultimately determine I did a wrong purchase. There are two things you want to look for in a good sim racing wheel: torque (strength) and smoothness. This wheel definitely can have a good amount of force, just enough to tell you what’s going on in the car, but definitely not the smoothness - gears grind pretty awful completely throwing you off the immersion of the game.

Go for a belt driven wheel, Thrustmaster T300/T300 RS, Fanatec if you can afford it.

First let me say that, unlike a previous reviewer had stated, this item came VERY well packed for a box this size and weight. Not a single blemish on the original packaging. Kudos to Amazon for that.

I really wanted to like this product because of the pricepoint and the number of positive reviews. However there is always some risk whenever you buy stuff like this and I must've gotten a lemon. I highly doubt this unit was returned because the box, manuals and contents were super clean and factory sealed.

Now I consider myself computer and tech savvy, having written programming language in LUA like most people write shopping lists. I can also build custom button boxes from electronic junk found at thrift stores. But for the life of me I could not get this wheel to work with American Truck Simulator on my Windows 10 computer rig.

I know the G920 CAN work flawlessly with ATS/ETS because of the plethora of YouTube videos and posts in forums. But after updating the firmware and numerous attempts to configure the settings and map out the buttons, no matter what I tried, this controller would not cooperate with ATS and vice versa. Even though the software showed all button inputs were functioning properly, my in-game vehicle wouldn't go in reverse and I could not brake with the pedals. I had to resign to the fact that I was sent a defective unit and had to return it. Huge thanks to Amazon for their no-hassle, no-worry return policies. I guess I'll be looking at the Thrustmaster line of products.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_140?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=140&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I am by no means a fan-boy for one brand other another, although the G27 has been a darling of mine, even after having used some comparably very expensive alternatives/upgrades. The general hand-feel and the experience as a whole with the G27 just left a lot more authentic and pleasant than others, especially due to the material the wheel is made from and the high build quality exhibited by the G27.

The G920 is supposedly an improvement upon the previous G27. It supposedly uses many of the G27's parts, but with minor tweaks here and there. along with enhanced compatability for 'modern' PC's and consoles. While I can see the similarities on paper, in practice these two products are night and day, and sadly not in the way that you might hope!

The leather on every G920 I have seen and/or felt has had a poor finish, particularly where the inner rim of the wheel intersects with the cross-member of the weel. Usually appearing to not be properly sealed together. The stitching on the G920 feels very starchy, and sharp, almost as though its some kind of sharp, ill-finished plastic rather than a fabric, and this becomes uncomfortable if you're quickly grabbing and moving the wheel around during intense moments and not necessarily ensuring your hands are always in positions where the nasty feeling stitching is.

The pedals this time around have recieved a modification in the form of a lump of rubber inserted inside the mechanism for the break. This is supposed to give a more realistic feel to the pedal, but in my milage this results in is a serious amount of leg work and unless you're thinking of hard-mounting the wheel and pedals, you're going to be pulling the wheel off the desk its clamped to a lot, as you naturally pull on the wheel to gain the traction and purchase necessary to apply totally unrealistic amounts of pressure to the break pedal, desperately trying to get it to fully engage. To better illustrate, the logitech driver software and its GUI is generally very well done by allowing you to not only setup each individual button but set options for most of them such as activation sensitivity. If one were to examine the brake pedal here in the gui while attempting to depress it so far as is reasonably comfortable, you see that its almost impossible to reach anything like 50% activation.

To work-around what I consider to be an inferior breaking experience due to this, I jacked-up the sensitivity from the default 50% to 100%. Doing this made it possible to get ~50% breaking activated without having to get uncomfortably forceful, although the highest activation I was able to manage was 70-80%, and that involved fully standing on the pedal and having it be weight bearing. As some other reviews have eluded, I am sure that if I spent many, many hours crushing this piece of rubber by depressing the break extremely forcefully, it might in the long-run be more reasonable to use, but I'm just not up for having to do that with a product in order to hopefully have it usable afterwards. There are other options available such as disassembling the pedals and the brake assembly to remove the block of rubber, which I'm assured solves this and allows the pedal to feel like any of the others, although I didn't get this far in with my last G920, as there was a more serious problem that had manifested within the first 2 hours of ownership which I'll go into later but suffice it to say that the whole ordeal of owning this product left a bad taste, and mobilised me to get a refund asap.

Above mentioned concerns aside, I can't for the life of me un-feel the motion of the gears within the wheel base moving when turning the wheel. Both the older G27 and this, the newer G920 supposedly use the same gearing system with different/updated sensors. For my money, the G920 feels absolutely nothing like the G27; with the G27, I didn't at all feel any of the gearing when turning the wheel, it was smooth and seamless, and any deadzone between teeth of these cogs felt so small the it was imperceivable. Now flashing forward to the G920, I can feel absolutely every cog engaging each and every single time I make even the most minor of adjustments to steering position, and the resistance provided by this engagement results in unpredictable movement where part of the a turn will feel lighter, faster or less resistant than others- imagine going up hill rather than down hill, obviously going up (against the tooth of the cog) will feel harder work and more resistant, but it feels like this happens every 1/4cm of a given turn.

After having felt the cogs moving as described that, not to mention the amount of mechanical noise they now make, I just can't un-feel it, and it gives you little confidence in accuracy if you're planning on playing say a racing game with the expectation of being able to reliably repeat sections/turns to get better times.

Moving on from the practical problems with the wheel, within 2 hours of light use, the wheel had developed an exceedingly irritating high pitched squeak when turning left. Think fingers down a chalk board type of sound, only constantly throughout any left rotation, and the vibration from that interplay of parts being felt throughout the wheel. Not overly enjoyable.

On the force feedback / vibrations (the intentional ones produced by the internal motors), I found these to be quite acceptable so long as you turn them down as in simulation games as the wheel would produce large amounts of counter-steer when just tootling along on flat tarmac. In racing or rallying titles the wheel produced results more in like with what you would expect. A lot of reviews and comments seem to elude to the force feedback not being overlypowerful. I disagree on this point, I feel as though it is plenty powerful, although I don't feel as though there's enough variety in the level of feedback. It often feels like its an all or nothing scenario. There are smaller more neuanced sensations it can produce, but the majority of the time it feels more like a harsh, jolting movement occasionally rather than an appropriate, sustained yet more subtle feeling.

Overall the I personally found the G920 totally underwhelming, and quite a problem child in Logitechs historically good family of products. I would highly, highly recommend the G27 over this if that is compatible with your choice of system, be it console or PC.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_151?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=151&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pedal pot issue and the simple fix on YT. Pedals are solid built with steel! ( Nothing has broken! ) and I'm rough on them!
After fixing the pot in the pedals i have had no issues with them! The wheel has been great ( No issues for me here ) although there is a dead zone of a few degrees L/R and I found no way to adjust. I race in GT Sport only on PS4. Would I buy again if need to? Probably as other wheels are very expensive. Oh and the red dial ( used for multiple adjusts ) Not responsive enough for me in GT Sport so I mapped this to buttons which work when you need them and focus on the road. ( fuel lean, tcs, abs, ect...)  Force feedback is adequate and can strain your muscles if you run off the road a lot! ( Ok by me! ) If Logitech would fix or have a software adjustment for dead zone and fix the pot issues ( which I see many have experienced ) And make sure that when you dial in fuel mixtures ect. with the red dial ( instead of have to keep turning until it responds ) they would have a GREAT wheel again. Thanks though go to them for there efforts. Without a product like this I really would not enjoy racing as much as I do! I simply cannot race a car with a joycon.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_149?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=149&reviewerType=all_reviews"

While it does work amazingly well on PC, I have to manually recalibrate it with the windows 10 wheel/controller window. The software made to support wheel on PC does not work well at all (it doesn’t nit recognize games, no remapping controls for controller buttons like A, Start, R2, and has NO built in calibration).

Tried in-game options and they made no difference. You can put your entire body weight into the pedal and your cars will slightly slow down but never come to a stop. I actually had to use the ebrake to completely stop the car.

Steering wheel was also IMPOSSIBLE to turn, and when you did get it to turn, it made a clanking sound. Logitech FAQ's suggested connecting to PC and changing sensitivity. That didn't quite sound like my problem, but I tried anyway. My PC is using Windows 7, and Windows WILL NOT recognize the wheel 50% of the time. I have to unplug and replug it in to get it to be recognized. Once plugged in, the Logitech Gaming Software SAYS THERE IS NO WHEEL CONNECTED. I have read over their forums, and the forums are no use at all. If someone from Logitech response at all, they never respond to your follow up. I tried to contact their support directly and they suggested applying the software update. I tried, and it too doesn't recognize the wheel. Worse yet, their own firmware updater freezes up and must be force closed. After multiple hours talking with support they were unable to even get their own software to recognize the device, let alone resolve my issue.

While I must thank Logitech for being so generous with the replacement, I must take a moment to warn those who are considering upgrading about some issues with the G29. I am primarily a PC player, but I also enjoy GT6.

Primarily, you'll find that the G29's drivers on a Windows machine are unsigned, meaning you cannot install the device without forcing a boot-time option to ignore driver signing in Windows, somewhat of an advanced procedure and detrimental to system security. In addition, the new Logitech Gaming software has removed several configuration options available to the G27, such as the ability to adjust FFB force, damper and spring force, and pedal axis combination. This completely breaks compatibility for many older games that require a combined throttle/brake axis. The new software also means that the G29 is not compatible with older versions of Windows, while the G27 could operate fully on Windows 98 and above. In addition to simulators like rFactor 2, I often play older titles like Gremlin Interactive's Whiplash, for which the G27 was a perfect controller with both Dosbox and running natively on an old PC. The G29 doesn't work properly with that game or many of its contemporaries. Hardcore simracers won't have many issues, but those who play a large amount of varied racing games may be disappointed.

As for the wheel itself, it's a very finely-crafted device, very comfortable, with a great button layout for any game. The gunmetal finish is gorgeous, and the leather feels a little softer and more textured than the G27. I feel that the brake bias adjustment wheel feels a little loose -- turning the adjustment wheel also slightly turns the button in its center, and as the R3 and L3 buttons ""float"" under the wheel's crossbars, careless hand placement could easily break them. On the other hand, all the buttons press crisply and are easy to find when focused on the road. The D-pad is particularly good, you could rock a fighting game with this thing! Because of its Dualshock face buttons, this wheel is great for emulators, so long as you don't need combined pedal axes.

The pedals are identical to the G27 except for the addition of a rubber stopper in the brake pedal. While this does work well as a non-linear brake, I find the rubber stopper to be too hard, especially in comparison to the soft spring. It feels more like a Gamecube shoulder trigger. It would have been great if Logitech allowed for stoppers of different hardness to be installed or for the stopper to be easily removed, but I imagine the rubber will grow softer with use and ""blend"" more with the spring.

Ultimately, this is another quality Logitech peripheral, let down only by unusually poor drivers.
If Logitech continues to update their software to include the missing functionality, I will revise my rating.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_149?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=149&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have dabbled in a couple others. Setting up the wheel is a breeze. No updates needed. It mounts very solidly with its clamp, provided you have a few inches of ledge on the mounting surface.

  It took some tweaking of the in-game settings to get it JUST right, so that was a little homework. (When doing this homework, you may come across sim racing snobs who claim this wheel sucks especially with horizon 4. Dont listen to them). Once I got all the settings dialed in this wheel works fantastic.

  Racing games are suddenly 10 times more enjoyable and immersive. You have infinitely more control over your vehicle, and it's SO rewarding once you tackle the learning curve.

  Build quality is EXTREMELY solid. Real steel wheel and pedals, real leather wrapped wheel (and yes it smells like new leather, it ain't fake) ...the plastic parts are heavy and dense. Premium feel and looks. This thing is built like a tank, and can generate violent feedback. I have actually dramatically turned down force feedback and vibration. It was almost too strong, so dont worry about some sissy ass feedback. These units are known for rock solid reliability and longevity and I'm pretty sure they have a 2 year warranty. It's also future proof if you are married to Game Pass Ultimate...as this WILL be compatible when ""Xbox 2"" (Project Scarlett) releases. The unit is just well engineered all the way around, so it will last for years.

Bottom line:
It is plug and play, but you will increase your enjoyment by setting up your wheel preferences in-game. If you can get this for less than $200, and have always wanted a wheel, pull the trigger. Lifes short, buy something nice for yourself! Because you will get hundreds, if not thousands of hours of enjoyment out of this little investment and driving games will take on a whole new dimension. I wholeheartedly recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

There are a few caveats:

1) the brake pedal is awful. Just terrible. Not even remotely realistic, I would have rather had no resistance at all over their idea of what brake pedals feel like.

Furthermore the insanely stiff spring does not allow the pedal to be depressed past the 40/100 mark, even standing on it. This means, out of the possible 256 brake positions (8-bit), you only actually have access to about 110 of them. This can negatively affect your braking ability quite a bit if you play any racing games that require skill (if you play arcade racers without any intelligence, like Forza Horizon, you'll be fine)

2) the force feedback is bonkers and will send you flying all over the track. I turned it back to 30/100 which still gives feedback but doesn't screw with your line. Completely and utterly unrealistic. Not even close! Do they not test these things out with actual drivers before-hand??

3) without a dedicated racing seat setup you'll be in pain after minutes.  A racing seat setup that positions the pedals in a sensible position is a must. Whoever designed the regular pedal position..... Quit your job please.

4) if you're not going to make it wireless, it NEEDS more than a 4ft USB cable. 10ft minimum!","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I also don't own a PS4, so all on which I had to test this was a PS3. I don't own too many racing games compatible with this. Besides some demos, the only racing game I own in full is Gran Turismo 5 XL Edition.

That said, this review will be based upon my limited resources, but I thought I'd give this review as an offering to those who may be in a similar position as me, and who still would like to consider purchasing this $400 driving wheel over others.

Out of the box, this set looks gorgeous.

Great quality and you get more than your moneys' worth. The pedals are awesome but like others have stated the brake is tough and needs time to break in. When you adjust your settings in game I always turn my deceleration outer dead zone to 80 or so depending on the game to counteract the problem and it works just fine. That is my only gripe and it is fixable and it goes away over time. The materials used feel sturdy and solid. The buttons are high quality. The leather is great. When in first use it would squeak a little when turning but that has gone and I have seen others with the same problem but it goes away. The response is absolutely perfect. The force feedback is very realistic.

Coming into the first corner of my first race, pushed the brake down until it started pushing back and went straight into the wall. Huh?

Rewound the race to start again, pressed the brake harder this time and BAM! Same thing. Straight into the wall. I know this is a FWD car and you can't really brake and turn but...what?

I looked for brake adjustments in the game and there are none. I decided to see what would happen if I pushed the brake as hard as possible. What happened was the entire pedal assembly rose up off the floor. Oops...that's not going to work. Tried again, pushing as hard as I could without mangling the entire setup, and this time I slowed the car and turn. ""Do I really have to do that every single time?"" Unless you're going uphill, pretty much yeah. That's how you brake with this thing and it's ridiculous.

So I did some searches online today and lo and behold, there are videos showing how to take apart your brand new $300+ wheel and remove a rubber part that makes braking virtually impossible.

I decided that, instead of taking the thing apart, I would try mashing the brake pedal down as hard as I could about 50 times to see what would happen. Sure enough, it felt a little bit closer to a real brake and I was starting to make normal turns. But it still takes too much attention away from actual driving. It sucks, basically. Finally today I just quit and figured I needed to do something. For me it's virtually unusable and definitely no fun out of the box.

Lastly, the comments about the D-Pad are true. Sometimes left is up, up is right, right is down, down is left. Keep a real controller handy.

After I ""fix"" my brand new $300 wheel, I'll update this and we'll see if the stars go up or down. Not sure if I'll go home and get a glutes workout by mashing the brake another few hundred times or if I'll take the rubber piece out. Kinda don't want to take it apart.

Bottom line... if you buy this wheel, plan on ""fixing"" it per the youtube videos.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_73?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=73&reviewerType=all_reviews"

BTW, the wheel can last you years if you treat it with care. Place the pedal back in its plastic covering when you arent playing with it.

I used a Logitech MOMO for many, many years, and in fact my dad still has his, and this was the natural purchase when I needed a new one. The only reason I rate it 4 stars instead of a perfect 5 is the fact that there's a slight squeak in the wheel when it turns to the left. It's not super loud - But loud enough that it's noticeable and distracting. I'm tossing between emailing Logitech for a replacement, or trying to take it apart and grease it but void any warranty there might be on it.

Other than that, the wheel is great. It's a great size, even for someone large (I'm 6'3"" and wear XXL gloves), and the pedals work great.

The wheel software conflicts with windows 10 and windows 8.

I thought it was the USB 2.0 issues with the USB 3.0 port. But the only game I was only able to use the wheel and pads was need for speed the run.

The pedals are also nice and high quality... Except for the brake pedal, its not low quality or anything but there is this pointless rubber piece inside of the spring that makes it literally impossible to press down on the breaks all the way and this doesnt translate well in games, I have to stand on the brake pedal for it to get pressed down all the way.... However, once you take apart the pedals and remove the rubber piece, the brakes are actually fine and its still decently stiff. Not sure on why Logitech thought it would be a good idea to put a rubber piece if the pedal cant detect how hard you are pressing it, it can only detect how far you pressed the pedal. Do this at your own risk, there are very thin wires inside of the pedal attachment and you could easily rip them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

A few weeks after I bought this my brother bought the Thrustmaster TMX PRO which sells for basically the same price as this or less. After using his wheel I would definitely have bought that.

Both wheels  do not come with a shifter and both do have the clutch pedal and conical brake mod for more realistic braking feel. Yet on the TMX PRO the mod is easily installed or removed depending on your preference. On the Logitech it is permanently  installed and requires invasive action to remove which also voids the warranty. I like it though, it was a little too stiff at first but after about 30 hours of racing it has broken in and feels great.

Both wheels offer an optional shifter, and the Logitech one offers 4 things over the Thrustmaster's, push down reverse, alot quieter, very short throw, and a much lower price. The Thrustmaster one is over twice the price, but it feels better, is made mostly of metal and is harder to accidentally put in to the wrong gear. The Thrustmaster also has a separate gate plate that is included with it to make it a sequential shifter. This is excellent for rally driving where the paddle shifters can be difficult to use. It is however very squishy in sequential mode not having that nice positive click that a sequential shifter should have. Because of that I would not purchase it if you're mainly looking for a sequential shifter do to its poor feedback. Their are better dedicated options out there.

The pedals on the Logitech are 8 bit giving a total of 256 unique positions. This sounds like a lot, but when running F1 cars where braking needs to be incredibly precise the Thrustmaster 12 bit pedals with 4,096 unique positions are noticeably better. The Logitech pedals do grip the carpet better though and look nicer.

The wheel, the G920 is prettier by far. The all brushed metal construction with leather wrap looks good and feels good in the hand. The Thrustmaster is mostly plastic with some rubber grips at the 10 and 2 'o clock positions. It looks cheap and initially feels cheap too. It is however about a 1/4 inch larger than the Logitech and I like the slight increase in size.

Yet this is where the Thrustmaster runs away with the show for me. When actually driving with it the force feedback is noticeably better, its more precise and less notchy. I can't say it is in a whole other league over the Logitech, but it is better. The cheapness of the plastic wheel is all but forgotten from the excellent precision feel you get from the force feedback.

That being said the Logitech is not without its upsides like better looks and overall build quality. The wheel base does have bolt holes for hard mounting. Which is real nice when using it with a stand. The TMX PRO does not. The TMX PRO table mount does work well though, and it seems just fine with out the hard mount. It does however stick down alot and will interfere with your keyboard pull out when mounted to your desk. The Logitech uses dual soft mounts that don't stick down nearly as much.  Both wheel's pedal boxes and optional shifters do have bolt holes for hard mounting.

I've debated on adding this part since it is not coming from my own experience, but to help others make an informed purchasing decision I've decided to add it. From what I've read around the net, the TMX pro does have a higher failer rate. So if you are looking for something to last a long time the Logitech would probably be your better bet. Its dual motor gear force feedback system is antiquated and has been around since the G27 wheel which is why it doesn't feel quite as nice as it could. Yet it is a proven system with many G27 wheels still in use today. I'm just speculating, but I think this may be why Logitech has chosen not to update it just because it has proven to be so reliable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Imagine loosing front end traction and going off track and getting 0 feedback from the wheel. Not what I was expecting.

Second, Omg. It feels like you're driving with a ratchet. You literally feel EVERY tooth in the gear that's providing the resistance. Because of this, it's not smooth at all, you feel it move in steps, so the force feedback isn't smooth or progressive, and then you get some loud pops which I'm assuming is a tooth slipping.

Then the build quality.. Everything else was OK except, 1) The paddles, made of plastic and the pull feels so rubbery, if it wasn't for the 'click' you'd have no idea where the engagement point is. 2) The red dial.. feels like cheapest and thinnest bit of plastic, it feels soooo brittle.

For the high price tag, more than the console and game, I was expecting this to live up to what it advertised but it fell soo far short.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, while the wheel does “plug and play”, you should install the Logitech control app so you can customize the wheel to user preference. In the case of Forza Horizon 4 (first game I used it on), it required a bit of fine tuning (YouTube was a good resource for finding a baseline), however more “serious” racing sims might not be as bad. Only problem with the pedals is the overall size, they are generally easier to use without shoes/footwear on, as the clutch and break are rather close, but this is a minor problem. Overall, the unit was easy to install, and is a decent racing wheel for the race enthusiast on a budget.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

First, the build quality is very very good. The wheel leather quality is great, to the point it’s nicer than many cars I’ve been in. Assembly and connections were straightforward.
For GT Sport, it does it’s job. The level of play is now to a greater depth with the precision this wheel allows. It opened up the game for me and I thoroughly enjoy it after months of near daily use. The pedals have a solid feel to them and durable, hence the metal. The throttle and brake pedals have different resistances between them, which may or may not be beneficial, depending on what you’re used to. The only irk I have is sometimes the red adjustment knob doesn’t work immediately when you’re driving around a track - it’ll sometimes work immediately, sometimes it will not and then be overly sensitive, which can be critical in some races. Don’t let this small detail deter you from buying this steering wheel set.
The force feedback has good strength and has actually aided me in bettering my autocross driving as a result of practice and feel in a game. In the F1 2018 game, the wheel vibrates and knocks like crazy down a straightaway - not sure if the system is trying to process a lot at once and combats itself, leading to vibrations. However, I think these are more game programming items than build quality of this wheel. Overall, an excellent wheel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm not sure if this is a bug or I got a defective or even if it isn't supposed to be used on the G920 but when I was a G27 user this wasn't a problem what so ever.
Another thing I found weird is that the shifter from the G27 works for shifting but the buttons on it aren't programable... This is a bummer since I wanted more buttons and I was hoping that this was a ""loophole"" that would allow me to use it and program it with more buttons.
Honestly I would get this wheel for its looks and upgrade, but if I was to choose between the G920,G29, the G27 or even the G25 I'd be smart and get the G27 even though it's now discontinued/ over priced....

Pros:
-It looks great
-It's a slight upgrade from G27
-It has a ""XBox Controller"" on it disregarding the triggers and joysticks
-It looks like a race car's wheel mounted on a plastic box with motors in it

Cons:
-Compatibility issues
-DOESN'T COME WITH A SHIFTER (and if you get the G27 or use the G25 shifter, in certain games it just doesn't want to be mapped)
-IT'S EXPENSIVE at $300-$400+ I'd honestly just save up and just literally get the G27... or worse comes worse get the T500RS by Thrustmaster....

What I paid to get this M3H it's okay, it's not the end of the world, thought despite that I hope logitech would be a bit more reasonable since I personally like a wheel along with good pedals that doesn't have a rubber stop and a shifter that has programable buttons on it and also lastly a wheel that is circular, but despite that this wheel works rather well on the XBOX so I would give it a star for that so I guess 3.5 stars even though it doesn't show...","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_120?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=120&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Hutson","Fantastic!","September 11, 2015","My son loves this!  After using it for a day we also purchased the shifter--which really adds to the fun.

To really enjoy all of the features of the wheel (shifting, clutch, etc.) you need to have a PS4 game that has these features.  Unfortunately, there are currently only 2 PS4  games that do--Project CARS and DriveClub.  I bought both of these games as well--and I'm happy I did.  The driving experience is great.

The wheel provides feedback that feels very much like real driving.  In fact, it seems so real at first that when you crash--it is physically shocking!  The foot pedals are heavy enough that they don't slide around.  We attached the wheel to a wooden desk that works reasonably well. It works great when only the wheel is used.  However, once we started using the shifter with the PS4 games the desk tends to move around a bit.  Perhaps I just need to shift with less force--but when you're in these games the adrenaline can really start to flow and I'm shifting like a madwoman!

Bottom line is this is a fantastic (and expensive wheel) if you have the PS4 games that support it.  I recommend buying the shifter as well.  My fingers are crossed that this will work with the next PS5 console!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_152?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=152&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This is a sub-$200 controller and is overpriced when not on sale.

While the build quality is very good, the materials used - and subsequently the cables included, are sub-optimal at best. The leather is especially cheap and ill-fitted in some spots.

It seems no matter what your setup is, the main USB cable isn’t quite long enough and requires an extension to prevent a clothesline situation between your wheel and console. Same issue with the power cable. It is simply not long enough to use without an extension.

The included wire management is adequate but is really ineffective if you don’t have the wheel mounted to a Playseat-style bracket. If you’ve got this clamped down to a table, chances are you’ve also got some cable management issues.

As far as how the wheel works, it is plug-and-play for console and PC, though PC users get the option of software fine-tuning for the best experience.

The wheel itself is nice enough to hold on to, but the switches/buttons feel very cheap and the paddles, while they are metal and large in size, have an unpleasant feel around the edges and have a mushy travel that results in less-than-satisfying gear changes.

The pedals are decent. Spacing is a bit too close for the sake of being compact, but is only a problem for big feet I suppose. The pedals need to be mounted to a bracket, otherwise they are pretty useless. The very aggressive carpet grip on the bottom plate can prevent them from moving under pressure, but there’s NO WAY you aren’t going to destroy your carpets after few uses. The brake pedal is progressively difficult to depress, in an effort to mimic real brake pressure, but it is just too stiff. If a game doesn’t allow for adjusting dead zones, you’ll never be able to reach 100% activation of the axis without standing on the pedal.

For the standard price it should definitely include the novelty gear shift. A clutch pedal with paddle shifters is so unintuitive and is really more about bragging rights to say your controller has a dedicated clutch.  If you don’t also have the gear shifter then it is unlikely you’ll ever use the clutch.

Overall, I enjoy this controller because I bought it on sale.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So Logitech was my first choice. Had my G25 for 8 years and really hadnt priced wheels in quite some time.  Sticker Shock !!! Didn't know wheels, good ones, were so expensive.  I did pay $252 for my G25 and after a very long search, ran across this G920 for $300, including pedals!  Great price for a quality product.  All metal wheel and pedals. No plastic feel. And truly believe I will get another 8 years out of this one.  In my opinion, Logitech is the standard for PC wheels. Setups nice and great quality.

I'm using on a PC so configuration is different (and why I gave 4 stars). I haven't found a whole lot on setup process in the box or just in general, although just enough to get it working.

For those using PC this is what I've gathered. Go to the Logitech website and look up your model, download the software and firmware update, run the software and select a racing profile, map it to the game, open game (install game before creating profile, it will recognize installed games on Windows 10, Windows 7 users may have to use installed folder paths to game exe root, and idk about 8 users you're on your own lol). ! Reboot ! It's never a bad idea, even if I sound like tech support ""have you tried turning it off and back on again?"". Open game and go to control settings and make sure the input and buttons are set to the controls not the key board. At that point if it doesn't work, reboot with updates, if selectable, confirm all settings in software and game again. That should be about it. I might do a video in case other people are having issues, like the comment if interested","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It is a great product but it does require some common sense to get it properly configured for optimal operations.  The brake pedal is stiff, which is great however it needs to be compensated for by adjusting your in game settings.  On FM6 I run my deceleration outside dead zone at 70 and it works phenomenally.

The remainder of your settings are personal preference, but I will post them here to help others.  To get to these settings on FM6 you need to go to: Options: Controls: Advanced wheel controls (by pressing X button in controls menu)

Steering:
inside deadzone =1
outside deadzone = 100
Acceleration :
Inside deadzone = 0
Outside deadzone = 100
Deceleration
Inside deadzone = 0
Outside deadzone = 70
Clutch
Inside deadzone = 10
Outside deadzone = 50
Hand Brake
inside deadzone = 0
outside deadzone = 50
Vibration scale = 50
Force Feedback scale = 100
Degrees of rotation = 420 (again personal preference)

In game I run Normal Steering.  I find Sim steering very challenging and hard to predict and catch power on oversteer.
The remainder of assists are all off.

***WHEN DRIFTING TURN VIBRATION TO 0***  I had to send my first wheel back to logitech for warranty after 3 months.  I suspect this is due to running a vibration setting when drifting and the wheel was constantly vibrating.  It would get warm and I believe it shook it self apart.  I have been drifting on 0 vibration for 6 months now with no issues.  T

The logitech warranty process was very straightforward and they were easy to deal with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I received it one day after release, having preordered it. I'm actually going to be returning it after a week of trial and looking to a different brand, as I feel that are a couple of fundamental flaws that don't belong in a $400 product. These views are after several hours of use in Forza 6 and Forza Horizon 2 on Xbox One.

First, the brake 'feature.' The amount of force required to press the brake is so great that I was deflecting the heavy-gauge plate steel on my openwheeler racing seat setup about an inch, and not registering more than 55% press. Thus, I had to set the max to 55 in my game settings. This isn't a realistic feel at all, unless you're trying to duplicate the feel of cable-pull brakes from the early 20th century. I also don't like that I am losing a ton of resolution by having to set the range so low, and on top of that, you're only really guessing where the brake bottoms out. It's a huge issue, in my opinion.

Second, the center deadzone. I read and watched every review I could before purchasing this wheel, and they all said something to the effect of 'it has a deadzone, just like all helical gear wheels do.' Having never owned a racing wheel before, I figured that it was no big deal as it was written off so casually. That's completely false. This is the best way I can explain it - if you drive a modern car on a freeway, and you're on a freeway (60+mph) curve, you'll be turning your steering wheel and operating your car completely capably at about 1/3 of the deadzone this wheel has. This leads to very little feel on high-speed curves, and I constantly was fishtailing on straights after curves until I set a center deadzone in my game settings. A quality piece of equipment should not necessitate this, in my opinion.

A minor nag - the white LED is extremely bright, and in your face if you look at the wheel itself. Not an issue while you're playing, but any time you look at the buttons to navigate menus, or if you're in a darkened room, it's really annoying.

The good stuff:

The construction quality is top-notch. All of the materials are very nice and the setup has a superb fit and finish. It's a very nice looking setup, and it feels good to use. The paddle shifters have a satisfying click and travel.

Packaging and setup are great - just a few unsealed bags and twist ties to go through. The clamps to hold the wheel on seem to work very well.

There's a USB quick-release on the cord, so you can leave the plug in your xbox if you need to disconnect the wheel. This leaves a very short cable hanging out, which is very convenient.

I wish I could recommend this product, but I can't. The flaws are just too much to overcome for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_97?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=97&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I unpacked and set it up on a folding table (just to try it), I love the steering wheel and it's feedback, you end up really fighting the steering column!  It reminds me of an old school bus I drove across country without power steering.  You will have strong arms playing this over time.  I really like the paddle wheels which I use for shifting.  My biggest complaint is that the brake peddle doesn't work much at all until you have your whole weight pressed on it.  To get it to work in reverse with the peddle you have to really stand on it.  I am looking for adjustments in the settings but nothing seems to improve it.

Excellent for Xbox One, requires some help on the PC.","October 30, 2015","This is a really good wheel for the xbox one.  The force feedback isn't as strong as other wheels for the xbox one, but you won't find those other wheels at this price point.

The pedals are amazing.  The brake pressure is a little high and I had to tweak it down in game.  But after that it was great.

The shifter addon works as described if you purchased it with it.  The floppy paddles are real metal.  Everything feels great with this wheel.

Why only 4 stars?  There are still some serious issues if you try to use this wheel on the PC.  Unlike other Logitech wheels in the past, they haven't updated the profiler to work with this wheel 100%.  You'll have some games that don't support the force feedback but does on other Logitech wheels.  You'll have others that read the pedals incorrectly.  Some will have the dead-zone off.  It is a bit of a hassle to get it going on games that don't support it properly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_59?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=59&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The feedback feels quite real, when you drive through speed bumps or kerbs the wheel shakes accordingly, when you lose control it rotates like crazy. It's simply amazing for a starter.

The point of a gaming wheel is to have better car control and a more realistic experience, so it works better for track racing games like GT Sports, not street racing games like  NFS Payback. The latter one is actually better with keyboards.

A few drawbacks:
1. the break paddle is a bit stiff so you really need to fix your chair. I tied my chair to the table with some ropes, which seems a bit silly.
2. there's no cooling system so if you play for too long, the wheel actually overheats.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I primarily play Project Cars 2 and Assetto Corsa on the PC using VR.  I decided to purchase this wheel because I wanted to try it out with my Xbox One X for the Forza games, as well as hopefully enjoy a better ffb wheel for my PC2 and AC games on my PC.

First impressions:  the ffb was actually worse than the G25.  The wheel had no 'weight' to it when driving.  Eventually I found that I had to inscrease the center spring strength.  But then the problems started happening.

The Good:  The wheel feels great, with good material.  The pedals are decent in that you can move the throttle pedal over to improve the heel/toe.  The brake pedal has some stiffness to it to add realism.  The XBox style buttons on the wheel can be programmed on the PC.

The Bad:  I bought the new shifter for this wheel as well, but it doesn't have as nice of a feel as the G25 shifter. Also, the buttons on the shifter were useful, but this shifter does not have them.  The experience with the XBox wasn't that great, as the FFB was underwhelming, and I would hardly feel any vibrations from spinning tires or driving over rumble strips.  I had expected this wheel to have a stronger FFB than my G25, but that is NOT true.

The Ugly:  The reason why I gave this wheel 1 star.  I installed the Logitech G Hub software on my PC to run this wheel setup.  It doesn't work.  The wheel won't properly calibrate to the right.  If you center it and move a mm to the right, the software immediately goes full right on the calibration.  There is no gradual movement, just an IMMEDIATE right.
After uninstalling the Logitech G Hub, I used the Logitech software recommended for this wheel.  THAT fixed the problem... but now causes another problem.
When racing, if you turn the wheel too quickly through a turn, such as trying to keep from losing control in a corner... the wheel suddenly goes off center for the remainder of the game.  At first, I thought maybe I damaged the car in-game and my wheel alignment was off... but sure enough the graphic display of my VR wheel did NOT match the same position as my Logitech wheel.
This happens ALL THE TIME.  The wheel is absolutely useless when playing.  I contacted Logitech Tech Support and I am simply referred to the online support section.
Logitech SHOULD FIX THIS PROBLEM WITH A FIRMWARE UPDATE but for whatever reason, they have stopped updating this wheel.
STAY AWAY FROM THIS WHEEL!!!  My 15 year old Logitech G25 STILL is better than this POS!","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

During the 360 era I was fortunate enough to get a Fanatec CSR and ditch the old plastic Microsoft wireless wheel. The CSR really ruined me on what kind of performance to expect for the price, as it was a stellar deal at around $400 (for the bundle). Since Fanatec can't seem to cater to that kind of market anymore, I had to settle for either the Thrustmaster or this. The G920 went on sale so that won out.

It's... okay. Certainly better than the old Microsoft wheel, but after comparing it to the build quality of Fanatec I'm left wanting. The force feedback is weak, and most times I barely register that it exists. The actual input feels so disconnected and twitchy that I can't even drift with this thing and spin cars out way too easily. I do hear a lot of people complain about the brake pedal stiffness, but that's one of the few things I actually LIKE. Brakes are not supposed to bottom out, people. Bleed your lines. Having some resistance makes it a lot easier to hit that locking threshold and stop faster.

All in all... if this is the ONLY thing you can afford, buy it I guess. It's better than using a controller. I'm seriously considering returning this and just paying triple for the new Fanatec CSL.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_123?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=123&reviewerType=all_reviews"

First, I'm leaving a product review from an sim enthusiast point of view. This is not my only Logitech wheel, now on to the testament.

I've owned logitech wheels for many years and still, to this day they are still functional. Not only are they reliable but they can be customisable and fun.

This Logitech G29 for PS4 and PC feels alot like the G27 but a bit improved. It feels good and it's very quiet compared to it's predecessors. When Force Feedback kicks in it rattles but not as much as the G25 and G27, the gears feel somewhat pleasurable when taking corners.

Pedals are way better than the G25 and G27, but not as much as the Thrustmaster t3pa pedals or the Fanatec Clubsports pedals. Clutch feels like a modern clutch, brakes feel alittle like in real life but requires mods to make it feel premium, gas pedal feels perfect. All in all it's worth the upgrade from the G25 or G27 pedals.

Shifter, i cannot testify if it is better then the old ones since i'm using the G27's shifter. G27 H shifter is compatible with the G29, but the extra buttons won't work but that's okay with me. I have not tested the G25 H and sequential shifter on the G29 but i'm sure it'll work.

The Paddle shifters click louder on the G29 and feels alittle heavy, not much improvement here. They are very responsive and sturdy, it will take a hammer to break them.

Pros:
Better handling wheel
Extra buttons on the steering wheel (you don't have to use a controller)
Leather wrapped steering wheel
Overall better pedals then its predecessors
Included are clutch, brake and gas brushed aluminum pedals
Wheel, paddle shifters and pedals feel sturdy
Dual gear Force Feedback motors
Best wheel for the money
Overall very reliable product and easy to maintain

Cons:
A little deadzone but not that noticeable
Small wheel rim
Gear motors (most of the time the Force Feedback feels unrealistic and it clunks)
Feels plastique

Judge for yourself, the pros outweighs the cons, but that's just my personal opinion. If you're on a budget and want a very ready to race and reliable wheel, and you are either a Sim enthusiast or game a lot this is the best option out there. If money is not the problem you should consider other hardcore brands, but make sure to get a warranty as premium wheels will break more often than the Logitechs. Overall (i know, i've used this word way too much) I'm very happy and satisfied with my purchase and this wheel completed my setup for GT Sport, Assetto Corsa, Project Cars 2 and so on. I truly recommend this wheel, it will last you for a very long time, just like my old DF, G25 and G27s.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Apparently Logitech's QC was piss-poor when it came to this product.  I figured I'd check their forums for a solution.  Well, it's a known hardware defect.  No use of them recalling the unsold products to fix them before putting them back on the market.  Just sell it and let the consumer waste time and money to send the broken device back and have them refurbish it.  It's a shame too, Logitech wheels have always been good to me.

Granted, not every G29 has this issue, but let it be known: you are taking a risk when purchasing this product.  The odds are that you will get a lemon.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_139?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=139&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I kept reading about people complaining about a ‘dead zone.’ I don’t notice it at all. Wheel feels realistic, it’s made of high quality material and the brake pedal feels great.  I will say this, at first the brake did require a lot of pressure to get full braking even on this newer sensitive G920. It wasn’t bad but def more than a real car.

I love the feel of the leather (or leather-ish) wheel material, and the aluminum paddles and pedals. The mounting clamps work quite well, although I did end up getting a stand so I have a little more control over positioning. Also nice that it has 3 pedals, so I don't have to replace those in addition to buying a shifter if/when I decide to go full manual.

Force feedback seems quite good, although it depends on the game. Forza 6 is kind of ""meh"" - I still think that game works better on a controller. However, Dirt Rally feels incredible. It's so good, I honestly think this was worth the purchase for that one game alone. Controller steering was always a little wonky in that game, but this has made it a great experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have a perfectly good G27 that is not compatible with the PS4 for seemingly no good reason. Beyond that, this wheel technically functions just fine. The break pedal is as stiff as everyone says, but it's not a deal breaker for me. For me, the real issue was the decision to sell the shifter separate and put ALL the buttons on the wheel itself. This is a problem because it can't be very difficult to locate the necessary button during a race while the wheel is being turned left and right to control a vehicle, ESPECIALLY if you do drifting at all.... get used to not having an e-brake. So overall the wheel functions fine, I wish the shifter was included and the buttons were on the shifter but that's my personal preference.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I tried using it for PS4 but I wasn't willing to buy the extra stand. I found the overall build of the wheel to be very sturdy. I was very impressed by the pedals which are themselves mostly metal. I also appreciate the extra carpet spikes on the bottom of the pedal stand that keep it from moving. The pedals also have a progressive feel that is very similar to real brakes. My main problem with the wheel is the feeling of the gears inside the wheel that provide the force feedback. When you first play something like Assetto Corsa, the feedback is intense to the point where it shakes the wheel when centered. What results is a jarring grinding feel as the wheel shifts back and forth. I highly recommend dialing the force feedback down to make it feel more like a real car. Overall, I expected a more fluid motion in the wheel when driving. Then again I'm not really disappointed, I've been able to use the wheel in multiple games and it has enhanced the experience over the typical controller.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The wheel is nicely packed and protected for shipping and convenience. After setting up it up, took about 30 minutes, I began to play FH3 and ATS. I immediately noticed 2 major problems and 1 small. Small - When not actually in a vehicle (Still in game, just not driving) the wheel centers normal.... until you turn it to the left of the center, and then it locks all the way left. Turn it back past the center to the right, and it centers fine. Major - 1. When turning the wheel back to the center (drifting, just turning fast, etc) faster than the wheel is set to auto center, the wheel starts clicking/snapping and locks and unlocks. This is really annoying when playing at night, as the wheel is usually really quiet, but that quickly changes. 2. In game when going STRAIGHT the wheel goes back and forth over and over again until YOU perfectly center it... Put it barely to the right again, and she starts again. This is SUPER annoying, this means its almost impossible to drive in a straight line. On top of all this the logitech settings are 99% useless. I noticed no difference when turning up/down the sensitivity on the wheels, as I was trying to fix the brake peddle, which is like pushing a boulder. Also unlike my TMX Thrustmaster FFB wheel, the wheel settings don't actually allow you to adjust the force of the force feedback. Therefor making you use in game settings to adjust it. This is USELESS because in most games (Forza Horizon 3/Forza Motorsports 7) THERE ISNT A FORCE FEEDBACK CONTROL AT ALL! I asked a question 2 days ago and it still hasnt been answered, although i canceled it and filed a warranty claim to replace it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_127?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=127&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I am very happy with this wheel.  I had a Driving Force GT for years, and it is still going strong. I gave it to my daughter's boyfriend.  Although I never owned a G27, I am certain this is an improvement.  They have stiffened up the pedals and the wheel shifters to give it a more authentic feel.  I actually have to put my weight down on the break to get full breaks applied, much like a real car.  This gives you more realistic and precise breaking.  The clutch, which I have not used yet as I am waiting on the shifter has a nice medium spring load which feels good as does the gas pedal.  The wheel is smooth and quiet with virtually no dead zone.  I have yet to adjust any setting in the game, and I don't think I will need to.  The buttons are all programmable within Project Cars, including the dial which can be used as two buttons, one clockwise, and the other counter clockwise.  This really has all of the positive attributes of the Driving Force GT and the G27 as well as some additional improvements.  It is likely to be as reliable as both previous wheels which is why I chose this over the Thrustmaster.  If I were to suggest an improvement it would be to make the wheel larger, but it ultimately does not detract from the experience, so no deduction in points on that.

These Logitech wheels are known to last forever. I've owned mine for almost 2 years now and it gets used a lot and still works like new. During long play sessions the motor will start to get pretty warm, but I've never had it shut down or lose FFB strength. You will want to get some leather conditioner to keep the wheel (yes, it's genuine) from drying out over the years. Also, the pedals are REALLY good, you can easily use them until they quit or you want to shell out for some really expensive ones. I plan on using them with a Fanatech CSL in a few more years.

GT Sport has the best FFB profile I've used so far, that game really makes this wheel shine. I highly recommend playing either GT Sport or GT6 with this wheel first. Project Cars 2 also feels really good, you just need to tune the wheel settings first. For PC2 use Jack Spade's profile (PC only) and then follow a tuning guide to get no clipping, if you're on PS4 just tune for no clipping.

This is a great first wheel, you really get a lot of FFB for the price and the peace of mind knowing that it's probably going to outlast your NEXT wheel. From here I'd move onto a T500 or a Fanatech CSL and keep the G29 as a solid back up in the event of repairs being needed.

Best of luck. (don't buy the extra sifter, you probably won't use it)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I just purchased the g29 for my return to online sim racing.  I was made very nervous by all the negative reviews talking specifically about the brake pedal.  It's stiff yes.  It should be.  I think it feels great both on ovals and on road courses.  I felt compelled to write this just so people aren't turned away by these overly negative reviews.  Iracing was completely plug n play...I came from an old school logitech momo wheel that had tons of issues on launch with sensitivity ect.  This was a dream in comparison.  Also a huge improvement in the overall feel and accuracy of the wheel.  My first race in the nascar monster series (after purchasing the car naturally) was a second place finish at talledega.

I always previously struggled with tracks like this with my previous wheel.  It was just nearly impossible for it to work with drafting...at least in the early years of its release.  I was able to tuck in behind and ride 30 laps at Talladega incident free (tho I saw plenty and had close calls) to a second place finish.  If the line had been 200 yards farther down the track I may have been able to get my nose ahead.

Anyways...dont be scared by the negative reviews.

None of the pedals were mapped correctly. The brake pedal was the accelerator and the clutch was the brake. I downloaded the Logitech Gaming Software program to update the wheel which was supposed to fix many problems.  I tried to remap the pedals and the only options I could change were the wheel axis sensitivity and the wheel rotation degree.

The first game I tested was Crazy Taxi.  The game crashed whenever I loaded it with the wheel.  I did not mind this with as it was an old game and it did not state it was compatible with the wheel anyways.

I next tested Burnout Paradise.  I had to manually set up the controls from within the game which was no problem.  The pedals were still mapped incorrectly but the force feedback on the wheel worked.  Besides the incorrect pedals, I felt the controls were fluid. The wheel had a nice feel and the clamps that are built into the wheel kept it securely on my desk.

I then tested Project CARS.  Previously, there were problems including the incorrectly mapped pedals and no force feedback.  However, this has been fixed in patch 4.0 released by the Project CARS developers.  There are no complaints as I have never owned a driving wheel game controller before and my only experience is either in an arcade or driving a real car.

Before you purchase this, you should either use it exclusively for the Xbox One (as it seems there are no problems) or research if this wheel works with the games you want to play on the PC as it seems many other people had problems with a variety of other racing games.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_153?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=153&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Not that it's a bad product. It's not even slightly bad. It's just that, for some reason, Logitech has rested on its laurels and released what is essentially the EXACT same product as the G27. Now, bear in mind the G27 was released in 2009. Yes, 2009. Let's put that in perspective: The Logitech G27 was released the year before the ORIGINAL Apple iPad was released. Yep, it's that old.

And now, in 2015, Logitech is releasing the ""exact"" (mechanically) same steering wheel and pedals, for far MORE money, and with no shifter included anymore? What...?!

*In the interest of fairness - the button layout on the wheel is of course different from the G27, and the brake pedal has a rubber piece (Logitech calls it a damper) underneath which stiffens up the pedal. The damper under the brake pedal means you need to push quite a bit harder than on the G27. It will be interesting to see how that additional pressure affects longevity here. If you had trouble with the G27 pedals shifting around on your floor, the G29 will probably shift even more due to the additional pressure required to press the brake pedal. Bottom line: When driving around, the wheel is the same, and the pedals (minus a stiffer brake pedal) are the same.*

Now, this also means many (all) of my same criticisms of the Logitech G27 are still applicable. If you have the time, you can read my review of the Logitech G27 Racing Wheel. My criticisms and compliments are essentially 100% applicable here.

Project Cars:

If you own a PS4, and are even remotely interested in a steering wheel setup, Project Cars is, as of August, 2015, where it's at. I found it extremely difficult (nigh unplayable) with a Dualshock 4, so the G29 is extremely good fun here. The force feedback needs some work, though, and the developers are supposed to release an update in the near future (it's August 10 as I type this). Currently, vibration of apexes of corners don't consistently set off the force feedback, and just in general it's a little off of where it should be. That said, it's still EXTREMELY fun, and transforms the game. It's a bit fiddly to make the wheel work in-game, so here's my little guide:

1.) Don't plug the wheel into the PS4 yet.
2.) Turn your PS4 on and load Project Cars using a Dualshock 4 controller.
3.) On the main menu when it asks you to Press X to start - don't -, just plug the G29 wheel into the USB port on the PS4.
4.) Wait for the wheel to spin/calibrate. Then, press the PS button on the wheel and choose your avatar/login name with X.
5.) Press X on the wheel to start Project Cars at this point, and then you can navigate the menu and play the game.
6.) You may need to turn off the Dualshock 4 off (holding down the PS button and going to Devices to switch it off - I've had it work sometimes without it doing this, and other times the wheel won't work until I turn off the Dualshock 4. Clearly this needs better support!

(*EDIT August 19*  The Project Cars patch that came out this week seems to have addressed the above issue with the G29 not being detected!)

DriveClub:

DriveClub is, today, an exceptionally fun game. Despite being released half-baked, it's come into its own in recent months - with constant support from the developer. With the G29, it's even more fun, though there's certainly a learning curve. If anything, DriveClub becomes more of a sim than ever before with the wheel, and you really need to be careful to brake before the corners, and not accelerate too hard out of them, especially in RWD cars. Either way, the force feedback is more effective here than in Project Cars (though not perfect - crashing into walls has no effect on the wheel force feedback, for some reason), but you can't go wrong with either game. I definitely recommend both. It's driving heaven.

PC use: It's a G27 to Windows. It works exactly the same. Zero improvements. It's a G27.

If you don't own a PS4, don't bother. It's the same wheel and pedals, mechanically, as the G27, but no longer includes the 6-speed shifter (sold separately!), and is much more expensive, because... reasons. So for PS3 and PC owners, stick with the G27. It's far better value (and will likely get even cheaper with the G29 now out).

I'm very disappointed in Logitech at this point. Six years on from the release of the G27 and Logitech seem content with re-releasing the same product..., for more money..., with a piece of hardware now missing (the shifter).

But, you might say, this is a really great steering wheel, so why 3 stars? Because it's by far the most consumer-unfriendly Logitech product out there. It's a slap in the face of gamers followed a veritable punch to their nether regions. If this were sold, as the G27 before it, with the shifter included, and for a similar price (translation: for the same price or a little less money than the G27 because manufacturing a G27/G29 HAS to be cheaper these days), then I'd still be disappointed with the lack of innovation, but give it 4.5 stars because it's a good product.

That the G29 costs SO much more than the G27 AND removes the shifter from the package is quite frankly - a travesty.

Oh, and a couple of further digs at the G29:

1.)  The Options/Share buttons are in the wrong place. They really should be reversed, since I keep hitting the Share button when feeling for the Options (Start) button. Why, Logitech, would you put the more commonly-used Options button in the MIDDLE of a cluster of buttons? *shakes head...* This makes restarting races a more annoying procedure, especially in less-than-well-lit room.

2.) The LED tach cluster is too low/too small on the steering wheel. I wish it were located at the top of the wheel like in a Ferrari F458 Italia. It's pretty much not possible to notice them during actual racing. But again, this was an issue on the G27, too, and nothing has changed.

Overall, 3 stars out of 5. It's clear that Logitech's heart was not in this wheel, and it shows.

PS On a side-note, I remember Logitech tweeting back in August, 2014, that the G27 wouldn't work on PS4 because of some "" security chip"" the G27 wheel was missing to work on the new Sony console. However, for example the Thrustmaster T500RS Racing Wheel - Playstation 3, which was released way back in 2011, has no such issues on the PS4. So I've no idea what Logitech is going on about here.

Top quality. Had been contemplating purchasing a wheel (compatible with both PS3 and PS4) about two months ago to further enhance my enjoyment of GT6 racing especially after the stress put on my hands and fingers using the stock DS3 hand-held controller hours on end. At first I was thinking of purchasing the Thrustmaster T150 but decided to do some checking/comparisons and reviews before deciding. On the one hand the T150 was cheaper while on the other hand the G29 was considerably more expensive. After much consideration I decided to go with the G29.
Reasons being: (1) Superior finish, both in base material and genuine leather covering. (2) Superior pedals with stainless steel. (3) Superior mechanics overall. (4) Excellent reviews. (5) Longevity.

So with the above in mind I decided the best decision was to put out the extra money (consider it an investment) and purchase the G29 about a month ago. I've been using it every day since, each for a many hours a day, and convinced I made the right decision. It has increased my racing enjoyment ten-fold including racing ability. I am extremely satisfied with it and wish I had purchased it before as it would have definitely helped previously. But as they say, everything in time.

There is nothing negative I can say about it. All positive and gets a full 5-stars. Additionally my hands and fingers are very thankful for the stress relief. Now I'm just waiting for the next release of GT6...GT Sport knowing full well that my investment will still be compatible.

Wheel and pedals are very well built and so far pretty solid. Setup was very quick, and even breaking down the wheel so I can move it aside is quick.

The steering wheel and all 25 programmable buttons work beautifully, the major problem is, the pedals don't work correctly on PC. The brake registers as the brake, the clutch registers as the accelerator, and the accelerator doesn't register at all. This is a known issue with the wheel, and it seems Logitech is ignoring the issue. In my searching of the internet, I've found a possible ""duct-tape"" fix that I am going to try and implement tonight, but as a ""quality"" product I should not have to be doing this. This puts me off about Logitech products as a whole, and I am going to seriously consider never buying their products again.

It is my opinion that if you are looking for a good steering wheel for PC, you are better off buying the G27, or even a Thrustmaster wheel.

I hope some of you find this review helpful.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_155?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=155&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I haven't had the time to sit down with the more racing sim games to give this a good workout but what I can tell you is the wheel is a bit tiny for my hands and the force feedback is more of a distraction than immersion. I tried turning the feedback down to super low levels in Forza Horizon 3 but it was still making my car spin out at every chance....

The first g29 I received had a horrible screeching sound when rotating the wheel left, right out of the box. Amazon was great and got a replacement sent to me quickly, however the second wheel had it's own set of issues. It made a grinding noise right out of the box, and over the course of a couple hours also developed a squeak when the wheel would rotate to the left, and the squeak was progressively getting worse.

I'm now on the third g29 from Amazon and after about a week of use the wheel has once again developed a squeak. On top of that, the gas pedal was also loosely-assembled out of the box, and had to be fixed.

At this point I'm giving up on finding a decent product from Logitech. Their wheels are plagued by quality issues that are simply unacceptable at this price point.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The force Feedback adds a realistic feel to the game but the motor is powerful and my cheap folding table was tipping while fighting the wheel to regain control of my cars. You can disable if by unplugging the power cord for the motor and just leaving the USB connection to the xbox/pc plugged in. The wheel is really sensitive without the motor however. Plan to have a sturdy set up for this wheel. My only complaint is the brake. The brake is really stiff and it takes a lot of force to fully depress the pedal. If this was not correctable I would have returned the whole thing! Fortunately you can remove a small rectangular piece of rubber from the break to reduce the tension from the spring. You'll need a set of torx wrenches size 10 and 30. You'll need a size 1 and 2 Philips screwdriver and a 10mm socket or crescent wrench. Make sure it's unplugged. Remove the brake pedal (middle pedal) with the Torx10 then remove all of the screws from the back of the pedal box. Open it up and pull the break pedal out. Be careful not to damage any of the wires! Use the 10mm wrench and the Torx30 to remove the nut and bolt that holds the brake together. Then pull the rubber piece out and put the spring back in. Make sure all the wires are placed properly in their spots before closing it back up. The game play is significantly improved with this brake mod! The spring itself is still pretty strong and I might go with a different spring later but it's playable now. Also, The pedal box has a spikey kind of ""carpet brake"" that you can pop out to hold the whole thing in place. It works surprisingly well on my rug. Before my brake mod the force of pressing the pedal would move the whole pedal set up now the carpet breaks work just fine to hold it in place.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It works great for both and has great wheel controls in the options. I noticed the description of this wheel keeps mentioning ""force feedback"" but I don't believe it said anything about the wheel being mechanically driven.. meaning theres an actual motor behind the wheel that has 100% control. Through that motor, you can control wheel stiffness, centering, etc. There is no spring that launches the wheel back to the original position. I was pretty surprised by this when I plugged it in for the first time and the wheel spun all the way in one direction, then all the way in the other direction, then back to center. I assume is was an auto-calibration. But it did all that without me doing anything other than plugging it in. It's pretty advanced stuff and knocks the socks off of the original ""Farming Wheel"" that this is replacing. As far as the brake petal, I can see how the stiffness could get annoying in a racing game where you need a fast response, but its great for simulator games. The stiffness prevents you from slamming the brakes when you're coming up to a stop. It makes for a nice and smooth stop that you have a lot of control over.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I race on Xbox One, Xbox 360, PS3 and PC. I've used a wheel to race for about 10 years now.

This wheel doesn't have the Auto-clutch feature of Fanatec and Thrustmaster. That would be nice, but you aren't going to be on the Hardcore Leaderboard in Forza 6 with any wheel unless you are seriously dedicated anyway, because wheels need Normal steering on and STM only on in that game to make the cars controlable.

But besides that...this wheel rocks. The problems with FFB people in having in Forza 6 are the games fault. Use this wheel in Project Cars on Xbox One or PC, or the other PC sims, and the Force Feed Back is right on. Also, the pedals are as good as Fanatec ClubSport pedals. Honest. Nobody is paying me to say that. It's true. Plus I'm on my third ClubSport brake load cell. They wear down over time. Knowing Logitech, their brake pedal will probably be reliable. With Forza 6, you need to go into Advanced Wheel settings to slide the Outside Deceleration down to around 60%.

So if you consider how well this wheel/pedal set works, $400 is a screaming deal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_136?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=136&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was told the pedals on the 29 & 920 are the exact same.  So I bought the G920, lo and behold the brake only had about 50-60% use/travel.  I opened up the pedals (~16 screws & a 6mm allen wrench/10mm box wrench) and found a 1/2x1/2x15/16"" rubber bushing in with the pedal spring.  Seeing that the full pedal travel is 1 & 1/2"" and the bushing is 15/16"", it's easy to see this bushing is the cause of the problem.

Plug and play with the PS4 with perfect, plugged it in and drove immediately, no setup required.

The wheel itself is wrapped in leather like it would be in a real sports car, and its hand stitched! It feels wonderful and natural when you're gripping it. I love the attention to detail logitech did here, like the shift lights on the top of the wheel. On top of that the wheel has easy to find buttons (important when you are wearing a VR headset). Everything is where 'it should be' so to speak. The wheel itself connects to the desk/table/whatever via two clamps that you can screw with some hidden hand screws. The one thing I am not thrilled about with this wheel is the paddle shifters. They do make a 'clicking' sound when that are actuated but, you cannot feel it. This clicking noise isnt helpful at all when in VR since youre most likely wearing headphones, without the tactile feel of a 'bump' its sometimes a little hard to know if you pushed it far enough. Thankfully you can hear it in the engine while in game.

The Pedals work great on carpeted floor, just make sure you drop down the spikes on the bottom of it. I cant comment on how they work on a hard surface, but i imagine there definitely needs to be some more rubber under it. As for the feel, well the clutch/accelerator pedal feel smooth and linear. For the brake however, its got a lot more resistance, especially near the end of the stroke. Its a nice addition from previous set ups honestly. Its how it would feel in a real car when you stomp on the brake pedal. I wish it also had some force feedback to simulate ABS for cars that have it, but i think thats just wishful thinking on my part... and besides race cars generally dont have ABS anyway.

All in all i think this is a great wheel for anyone attempting to use with VR.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

And it is a very nice wheel , when it works

update - No Response from Logitech Customer Service.  Really , no response !  But Amazon is happy to replace this defective unit with a new one - free of charge -  Thank you Amazon.

 I received this monster yesterday and just started installing it this morning.  It is now 4pm  and it still does not work properly.  First note that I have confidence that some day soon it will be working but it is a disaster out of the box.  There is absolutely no instruction provided with this thing.  Yes there is a picture gram of the wiring but seriously - who really needs that ?  You will need to go to google  to find out that you need to down load Logitech gaming software plus up date the g920 firmware.after that you are totally on your own.  I have been trying to use it in 4 games - Euro Truck Sim2 , Farm Sim 17, Dirt Rally and Assetto Corsa.  Just to be sure it not a single game issue.  I can get the thing to steer and the gas and brake work but there is no force feed back at all.  I have searched the games forums and there are just no answers for this problem.  maybe the unit is defective. I have emailed customer support.  If it ever starts working I will up date this review.

Price is a little high but since there is not a lot of options for Xbox one racing wheels l was willing to give it a try. I bought this wheel to mainly use for project cars and it has not disappointed. Works well Forza titles as well , but l have found adjusting the sensitivity settings low works better for forza. Quality construction and it just feels like it is made to last. Force feedback can be very strong and the pedals feel great too. The progressive brake pedal really helps.l also purchased the shifter and have been very happy with it as well. It does take some getting used to since you don't get any feedback through the shifter, but it does add to the experience if you are driving manual shift. If you love racing games and are considering a wheel I recommend this product. It will also improve your lap times.

I read almost everyone's reviews of all product to be used on the xbox one. The break peddle to hard?
. In the advanced settings where it's says throttle % on down the line... Breaks, steering how far you want to turn the wheel for a complete turn I use -6 To turn the adjustment is made at the bottom you will see how far your travel is and how how hard you want the wheel to comeback to the center that one scared me the first time I used it I wasn't expecting it to be so strong and  for the breaks for being to hard. Adjust them to how much pressure % force needed for 100% use I use 25% it's not to hard like normal to me.
 You can adjust this wheel to however you drive how hard you want to step on the breaks. To preven from sliding a lot on gravel lower hour throttle so you can't burn out in rear wheel drive cars. You can control how heavy the wheels are for force feedback do they slip what percentage break clutch seat adjustments height it is very nice once I learned that I can customize the wheel to how I like and feel the weight the engine effect it has on steering what percentage. There's so much to this steering wheel that people seem to not understand it or how to adjust it correctly. Trust me I had all he same frustrations as every one else here about how hard the breaks are. Next  how many times do you have to turn the wheel just to make a u turn first off it was two complete turns of the steering wheel that's were I already stated the -6.
 At first I wasn't happy at the steering wheel it was to difficult to run dirt Rally with. the steering wheel away to difficult to complete turns then fight with the wheel wanting to go back to zero when I need it to go right.  To much of a fight. I fix it by adjusting your throtle breaks force feedback and how far you want to turn the steering wheel . Me just A 1\4 turn on the wheel is almost enough to make the sharp turns. Just thought I would let people know there's a way to fix most of the issues by yourself if you play with it in advanced setting.

It feels more well made and sturdy.  I just wish I could play GTSport with it, but that's what my T150 is for.  I use the G920 for FH3, F7, PC 1 & 2 and Assetto Corsa, all on PC.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After reading tons of reviews and watching comparison videos. I bought a thrustmaster tx and it was doa, it was supposed to be almost as good as a high end fanatec but light years ahead of a Logitech g920/g29. I then ordered the g920 to replace it and wow it's a nice steering wheel. A nice grippy feel but not to grippy and the buttons and pedals feel sturdier than the tx. After using it with some driving sims it worked great even out of the box. I would recommend this for any beginner or sim racing enthusiast and do not recommend a thrustmaster tx.

LITERALLY.","October 14, 2018","so yesterday, October 13th, 2018; it was raining pretty heavily in Phoenix. I was coming home from work on the free way when suddenly on the way i made a lane change and hit a big puddle of water and lost traction on the right side tires and started to hydroplane. Thankfully I've been using this steering wheel to play Forza and drifting was my go to. So naturally I began to gather a certain feeling when using the steering wheel, what to do, and how to do it. its sounds kinda cringe but when the hydroplane event commenced the first thing that i thought about was Forza.. therefore when i was sliding left and right in the middle of the freeway next to other people, i knew exactly how to handle the steering wheel...  and that is how this product saved my life, it gave me the chance to practice driving.... or... atleast to a certain extent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I bought this a while back and it arrived fine with no damage to the box.  I installed it for my PS4 racing games.  Right out of the box it does some kind of test by rotating the wheel as far right and left as it will go, making a loud clunky noise.  I knew this wheel has gears but I didn't realize how noisy and clunky it would be.  It has good force feedback, but the gears just take away any positive experience.  After trying it for a while, I noticed that when I turn on the ps4 it would turn the wheel full left and right and make a horrible sound, which may have been faulty from the factory or maybe this is normal.  Either way I was not happy with this and I returned it and got the Thrustmaster T300.  Wow, what a difference, night and day between these 2 wheels.

The T300 does the same wheel test but it's smooth and relatively quiet, because it is belt driven.  I played some project cars and hit the wall and the wheel almost took my arm off....lol.  I had to turn down the settings, because my arms were getting tired after a few laps.  This is definitely the experience I was looking for.  I would say this wheel is for kids and the Thrustmaster is for adults.

I did enjoy the leather wrapped wheel, and the pedals were amazing, but in the end the better product wins.  I wish they did sell the pedals by themselves, because they are fantastic,  but I got the T3PA pro pedals and they work great also.  I can't really give a full review because I think the wheel wasn't working right out of the box, or maybe that's just the way the gears are supposed to sound.  Just in my opinion, the Thrustmaster gives a better feel of road bumps and crashes and an overall better race experience.  Hopefully this helps you out on making a decision.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_144?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=144&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I purchased the set for Christmas 2017 - barely 3 months ago.  The wire connecting the pedals to the wheel routes from the front of the pedals, requiring a 360 degree turn back under the pedal assembly to route up to the wheel.  Pressure on the pedals moving it forward pinches and in my case split the wire.  Resulting short makes pedals inoperative and whole product useless.

I attempted to remove the damaged section of the wire as a repair while also contacting logiteck via chat.  The chat resulted in my being cut off after the rep told me I had violated the warranty by attempting a fix.  Several subsequent emails including one bizarre sequence where I was told they declined to replace my product as it was out of warranty and a minute later sent a mail asking if I was satisfied.

All I need is replacement pedals ... Logiteck claims they do NOT have just pedals.  I've said I'd pay for pedals ... they don't have any spares.  So my course of action is to pay full retail (about $70 more now than the pre-XMas sale price) for a complete set that I don't need.  And they ask if I'm satisfied.

Not sure which is worse ... the design flaw that caused the problem or the support? ..  leaning toward the support.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_154?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=154&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Makes Driving in games like Forza 6 way more fun than using the remote.
I bought this to go with my PlaySeat Challenge (foldable racing seat Playseat Challenge) because I knew there was no way to sit properly on the couch, and still get the feeling you are racing.

Pros
+ Great feeling wheel, feels almost as good as the perforated leather wheel on my real car :D
+ Looks good! I know it doesnt mean as much as how it performs but there are some hideous wheels out there!
+ 3 Pedals, In case you want to learn how to drive manual. Good feedback, although some have complained that the brake takes strength to push.
+ Makes Racing games a blast! Even my young kids were playing on it and having fun.
+ Best wheel in this price range.
+ Works with PC

Cons
- Expensive. Have to think long and hard on whether you want to spend the same amount of money on a wheel that your console costs. Sweet spot for a wheel should be $250, not $400.
- Shifter comes separate. I dont need it (yet) but doesnt feel good knowing shifter will cost you an extra $60.

Should you buy this wheel?
If you own a PS4 (G29) or an Xbox One and love racing games then this is a must buy wheel for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_149?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=149&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was on the verge of dropping nearly $1,800 on a fanatec setup, but was concerned about the long-term durability.  At that price, I can buy 4 of the G29, so that's what I went with - and I'm glad I did.  For a first wheel at low cost, the compatibility and quality is on point.

Pros: Great feel, low cost, clutch pedal included (looking at you, thrustmaster), PC/PS4/PS3 compatibility (G29 model).  Less than $70 to add on a 6 speed shifter.

Cons:  You can definitely feel where they cut corners to make this at such a low price point.  A lot of plastic components, the clamps do not seem to be strong, the wheel is a bit on the small side, not as precise as it could be, but definitely good enough.  I'm not crazy about the logitech software to configure the wheel and find it a bit frustrating to get the settings to stick.  The remainder of complaints concern the 6 speed shifter, but that is not included with this, so that'll be reviewed separately.

Improvements: Pedal mods - i'm not going to do this, but these little flaps feel nothing at all like a real car.  I know there are plenty of mods to get a better feel out of the pedals.  The paddle shifter had a plastic 'click' to it that sounds like it's cracking rather pressing a button - I also wish it was a bit larger.

Overall, I would highly recommend this wheel to someone getting into sim racing.  I don't see myself upgrading from this setup for a while, if ever.  I'm happy enough that when it comes time to buy another for compatibility or when this one wears out, I may buy this again or whatever logitech's next revision is.

-----
Edit: Since the wheel and shifter were purchased separately, but listed on the same page - I can't leave a separate review for the shifter, so here it is:

I can't say I'm thrilled with the shifter on its own, but it does the trick.  It feels cheap, it offers very little, but it completes the kit, it's small, and it works.  I don't regret buying it, I'm not thrilled with the purchase either.  I'm happy enough with the G29 that it makes up for my disappointment and the lack of any feeling in the shifter.

Pros: works, short throw, small, and dirt cheap in comparison to other shifters

Cons:  No resistance, no weight to it, all plastic, no additional buttons, no sequential switch/option

There are mods to the shifter that add tension and will even allow you to make it a sequential shifter.  I may buy a 2nd shifter to mod - to make it either a sequential shifter or a handbrake, but that's something I'll address later.

Overall, if you want a shifter to complete your setup, this is cheap enough to go for it.  If you're on the fence regarding whether or not you want a shifter, just skip on it.

-----
To summarize the reviews for the wheel a shifter: Wheel kit is great, shifter is cheap enough that it warrants its purchase if you want a shifter with your kit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_115?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=115&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When I received the package today it was poorly packaged and looked like its been opened. Although the contents didn't look to be tampered with. Upon setup of the wheel and pedals it was straight forward.

Once I go the software downloaded (PC) and everything calibrated it worked pretty good on the few games I tried, although I didn't like the feel of the wheel.

Then where the 2 star review comes in, the buttons stopped working when all the software was up to date and connected to the PC. When driving in some games it often would correct itself to the center when it's not needed and ruins the experience. After working in the settings nothing seemed to work to which I had to return it to go for the Thrustmaster set which I tried saving some money on buying this instead.

If this has any influence on your purchase buy with caution and do some reasearch on the games you'll be playing and make sure they're no current problems with the wheel setup. I heard of some problems with Forza Horizon 3 but didn't expect it to make it unplayable.

This was my first wheel and I wasn't amazed by this product as I'd hoped.

In short either save up for the Thrustmater VG TX Leather Edition or save a hundred and go for the Thrustmaster TMX.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_122?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=122&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pretty sad about this...

I never owned a steering wheel. I have never used the G27, played a few racing games at the local arcade (Initial D, Max Tuning or whatever) and on my friend's setup ages ago which I can't even remember what it was.

I've been researching wheels since earlier this year, before the G29 was announced and through out.

I was considering the Fanatec Porsche, Thrustmaster 300RS and the 500RS as well as waiting a bit to save up for a Fanatec Clubsports...

Well, I wasn't sure how much I'd get into racing games so I held off for awhile reading reviews and I couldn't commit to nearly 1k dollars for a Fanatec CSP set and frankly speaking all the bad reviews scared me away from Thrustmaster. So it was either the Logitech G27 or the G29.

Well I'm glad I went with the G29. Originally I thought I didn't need to get PS4 support but I realized that most of my friends play consoles for racing rather than PC gaming so I figured I'd get the one that has the support.

This works right out of the box for GT6 on the PS3 and it is awesome. I never got into that game because it was too hard for me to play with controller, but this, this made it so much more fun.

The other games I've tried so far is Project Cars and Grid Autosports.

Project cars is a weird one for me, initially it worked but after tweaking some settings it messed up my controls (pedals were backwards) and had to fiddle with the settings to get them to work right.

Grid Autosports just straight up doesn't work. I gave up. Not even gonna bother with the headache. Menu keeps scrolling, can't change keys, stuck facing backwards and steering doesn't engage. I don't know if it's the Logitech software, my settings for the wheel, or the game but I gave up.

It doesn't work in Need for Speed Undercover. Couldn't get to the settings.

I'm just waiting for the new Need for Speed reboot, preordered  it and waiting to play with friends. Plus GT7 sometime maybe next year.

Controls wise it feels fine, I was a bit skeptical of the wheel size since it seemed so tiny but it actually is really practical. I'm amazed on how small the actual wheel base is and it's pretty quiet. The pedals aren't bad, but I have nothing to compare to besides arcade ones. I may consider getting Fanatec's Clubsport V2 or V3 later on but for me it works fine. The paddle shifters work fine, I had a 2015 Mustang rental recently and it had paddle shifters and these feel about the same, if not better.

I have my wheel base mounted to a Obutto Ozone cockpit, works great, pedals I haven't figured out how to properly mount yet but they aren't slipping everywhere so I'll figure something out later.

Final conclusion: At this price I wish it included the stick shift. The driver support is a bit whack. I don't get how to get games to work on it but it works fine in consoles. The profiles are a joke for this inside the Logitech suite. Half are still assigned to keyboard. I don't regret it though. It's a lot of fun and a totally different gaming exp.

Edit:
So I've had this for over a month now, and to be honest... I still love it. I'm just disappointed with the lack of game support. Project Cars isn't a bad game but the cars I like aren't in it and the style of driving is.... not really something I find all that fun. GT6 is awesome on the PS3, I play one or two races daily.

Don't buy the stick shift. It isn't worth it. It works in Project Cars. That's the only game I personally can confirm it works.

Games I've played so far that work with this wheel, NFS: The Run (a bit awful though, can't really adjust settings, not very fun), Project Cars PC, GT6 (ps3) and thats it so far that i've gotten to work without too much fiddling.

Games that don't work that I've tried, The Crew (PS4), NFS 2015 (PS4), NFS Undercover, Grid Autosports (this is kinda weird one, it works for some, I haven't found a way around it)

Quiet! Do not physically modify your brake pedal, read more!","November 13, 2017","Excellent feedback - especially with FM7 configuration. I've increased the resistance to help simulate actual driving a bit more. Only complaint is that I wish that the steering ratio would match each car individually instead of having a global ratio... maybe it does, but it doesn't seem like it. I like the fact that Dirt Rally has a preset configuration which works nicely... and makes the game 500% more enjoyable (you can actually rally now). As a novice racer in real life, this is pretty good... aside from the brake pedal stiffness (which is unreal to get 100% in FM7 w/default settings).

Contrary to another review, you should NOT modify the brake pedal - as this may void the warranty and is unnecessary with newer games (I'm unsure of how far back for games you'd need to physically modify the brake pedal).

The correct solution is to modify the outer dead zone for deceleration to about 50-70% -- you can test the optimal setting by driving and watching the red bar on the bottom-right hand of your HUD in FM7 -- this shows you braking pressure. If you're braking as hard as you physically want to brake, and the red box is not filling up, then lower your outer deceleration dead zone a bit more. Tada! The same applies to some other games as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

The last wheel I owned was the Xbox 360 force feedback wheel in 2007, so I have no reference point to compare to other Xbox One or PC wheels.

Initial impression is the wheel and pedals are built really well. I won't go too much into the quality, as the description covers the types of materials used, but it met my high expectations for at least perceived build quality. At the price point the wheel is set at, it's disappointing the shifter is not included, but I digress.

As others mentioned, the brake pedal is pretty stiff, but I don't find it so stiff that I would make any changes. It could be slightly less stiff, but I think that will wear in over time. Overall, I like the way the pedals feel individually, but your experience with other wheels and real cars may influence this (I've driven cars with stiff brake pedals, which may be why it doesn't bother me so much). That being said, it is pretty necessary to put something heavy behind the pedals so that you do not push them away.

My plan is to build a stand at some point, but my impromptu setup was to attach the wheel to a folding wood TV tray, I then added about 20 pounds to the tray to weigh it down, and then as I mentioned I always back the pedals with something to keep them in place. It works well enough.

As for the wheel the in use, after a little getting used to, it's very fun and adds another dimension to Forza 6 (the only game I've played it with). Being able to more reliably use partial throttle around a corner, being able to feel the understeer, etc., are a few of the doors that open.

The force feedback is pretty quiet and feels good when you're on track. The feedback does seem to be pulling to wheel center more than it's pulling in relation to what your car is actually doing, but it still feels good. The main time that it does not feel particularly realistic is when you go off track or your car gets really out of control, at which point you are frantically turning and fighting the wheel to correct.

Assuming this wheel has no internal issues that cause it to stop working, the only downsides I see are
a) the need to build a stand (or buy an overpriced one) if you plan on using the wheel a lot (improvising like I did works but it's not ideal, and you won't get away with putting the wheel on your lap)
b) the price (and that the high price does not come with the shifter because, let's be real, if you get the wheel and shifter for $360, which is the lowest price I've seen, you could buy a console and game bundle for less)
c) no headset jack
d) no ability to use wirelessly (which may be a blessing since lag could be an issue wirelessly)

Beyond that, it's a really fun piece. If you're a racing game fan and can get past the price, it's definitely worth buying.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_79?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=79&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I didn't get with a shifter but it looked more sturdy than the G27 piece of plastic. Steel construction at the cross-section in the middle, and probably all around the wheel, nice thick leather wrapping that's on there pretty good. Overall very sturdy.

I was also skeptical about the fact there wasn't a version without Xbox/PS4 buttons, but it grew on me as a nice convenient controller to navigate menus easily. The only actual issue I'd say, would be the thing about brake pedal everyone complains about (with it being very stiff), but it honesty doesn't seem that bad. If anything, it feels pretty realistic with it being tight instead of having to floor it...I did have to change brake saturation in-game to about 40% thought, so if you play an unsupported game and can't control that any other way, you would definitely have a hard time apply brakes to 100%.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Secondly, logic tech needs a better instruction when using for the PC.

It took me a while to figure out what I needed to do in order for it to work right.

Banville","Doesn't feel natural","April 13, 2016","This is my first gaming steering wheel. Maybe I was expecting too much. This thing uses gears attached to motors inside to give the wheel ""weight"" and force feedback (ffb). One problem is that u can actually feel (and hear) the meshing of the internals gears. And the way that the ffb kicks in doesn't feel natural. There is a little play in the centered position where you can shake the wheel and the car on screen shows the steering input, but the mechanism isn't activating, so there is no wheel ""weight"", but turn the wheel a little more and BAM!, u feel the weight. In short, this wheel is far from ""natural"" feeling. The build quality is top notch though. I only tried this on F1 2015 and Forza 6. I'll b returning it and trying the Thrustmaster tx 458. A utube channel called sim racing claims it feels more natural. I'll post a review of it soon.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_150?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=150&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I received it one day after release, having preordered it. I'm actually going to be returning it after a week of trial and looking to a different brand, as I feel that are a couple of fundamental flaws that don't belong in a $400 product. These views are after several hours of use in Forza 6 and Forza Horizon 2 on Xbox One.

First, the brake 'feature.' The amount of force required to press the brake is so great that I was deflecting the heavy-gauge plate steel on my openwheeler racing seat setup about an inch, and not registering more than 55% press. Thus, I had to set the max to 55 in my game settings. This isn't a realistic feel at all, unless you're trying to duplicate the feel of cable-pull brakes from the early 20th century. I also don't like that I am losing a ton of resolution by having to set the range so low, and on top of that, you're only really guessing where the brake bottoms out. It's a huge issue, in my opinion.

Second, the center deadzone. I read and watched every review I could before purchasing this wheel, and they all said something to the effect of 'it has a deadzone, just like all helical gear wheels do.' Having never owned a racing wheel before, I figured that it was no big deal as it was written off so casually. That's completely false. This is the best way I can explain it - if you drive a modern car on a freeway, and you're on a freeway (60+mph) curve, you'll be turning your steering wheel and operating your car completely capably at about 1/3 of the deadzone this wheel has. This leads to very little feel on high-speed curves, and I constantly was fishtailing on straights after curves until I set a center deadzone in my game settings. A quality piece of equipment should not necessitate this, in my opinion.

A minor nag - the white LED is extremely bright, and in your face if you look at the wheel itself. Not an issue while you're playing, but any time you look at the buttons to navigate menus, or if you're in a darkened room, it's really annoying.

The good stuff:

The construction quality is top-notch. All of the materials are very nice and the setup has a superb fit and finish. It's a very nice looking setup, and it feels good to use. The paddle shifters have a satisfying click and travel.

Packaging and setup are great - just a few unsealed bags and twist ties to go through. The clamps to hold the wheel on seem to work very well.

There's a USB quick-release on the cord, so you can leave the plug in your xbox if you need to disconnect the wheel. This leaves a very short cable hanging out, which is very convenient.

I wish I could recommend this product, but I can't. The flaws are just too much to overcome for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_130?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=130&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have trouble reproducing the fault, but it happens the most while being at some high rotation and then turning it the other way quickly. I wish I saved my money as none of these are defects, they out the rubber cube in the brake to make it feel ""real"" (if by that they mean it simulated a water bottle under your brake) and if you search the tracking issue is very common.

Logitech's service support sucks. Oh, and also the brake paddle takes a mammoth to press down fully. Overall product feels and looks good, but does not work. This product is awful.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_138?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=138&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I am not sure what the rest of 1 star reviewers are talking about, but that wheel is absolutely awesome. Yes, it is pricey and yes it is more money than the old G27 and yes it does not come with gear shifter anymore which you would have to buy separate for another 60 bux. BUT let me tell you something, that wheel is as sweet as it gets. Brake pedal feedback is huge improvement. All buttons now are on the actual wheel so who needs a shifter anyway when you have the paddle shifters. Use the gear shifter mount to hold your beer can or something. As usual Logitech did not disappoint me as far as quality and looks. Leather stitching, wheel all anodized aluminum or stainless steel components. Beautiful design over all. Noise is undetected; wheel turns smooth and very quiet... Wheel response and feedback are on point and pretty realistic. I am sorry for the negative fellow racing sim gamers, but I can confidently give the new G29 a 5 star review.  Go ahead and check out some of the pics I took of it so you have a better idea how it fits on my Openwheeler Racing Wheel Stand Cockpit Blue/Black | For Logitech G29 | G920 and Logitech G27 | G25 | Thrustmaster Wheels | Racing wheel & controllers NOT included rig.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_115?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=115&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought this because its listed on many websites and vlogs claiming this wheel is the best entry level sim racer controller, great quality, sim racing, sim-rig, blah blah, etc.

I guess what they dont disclose is that they are attention-whoring corporate shills desperately trying to be “influencers”. I will tell you honestly that this controller is just a cheap feeling toy.
I went and spent over 1k on a racing rig that feels crappy at the very least. Money down the drain, thanks to target advertising and brain washing by nerds who have never even sat in a high performance car.
A decent racing simulator will end up costing as much as a track car. Id rather do the real thing. The desert is real.

The build quality and design:
Its basically a micro steering wheel thats smaller than a riding lawnmower steering wheel. The wheel and shifter claim to be real genuine leather... which is probably made from scraps because it feels worse than vinyl. The “leather” on the shifter boot is all crunchy and dry.
I actually installed an aftermarket shifter knob because the little butt plug knob logitech installed looked pathetic.
The mechanical design feels very cheap. I can feel the plastic gears grinding inside. Also the violent forcefeedback feels way off.

Oh, lets not forget about the mandatory software. So Logitech crams down their spyware called Logitech Game Controller which data logs everything on your PC. This instrusive bloatware rapes 3-400mb of ram and keylogs your keystrokes.
To be fair, the Logitech spyware is less invasive than Corsair iCUE and Razer Synapse apps. Those require email and direct app connections to their server client and Razer even hijacks customer PC’s to mine bitcoins.(not making this up)
BTW this app is necessary in order to use the wheel controller because the wheel will have tons of software issues.

I spent so much time trouble shooting that i spent less time playing games with it. I kept getting a flashing xbox button. After hrs wasted on finding a fix, the pedals crapped out on me.
The gas pedal mysteriously stopped working. After many hours of reserching on the internet, i found that many people have the same issues as i have and never found a solution to fix them.
In the end, i had more fun shopping for PC crap and building than actually playing anything on this junk.

I understand that these controllers are just for fun, and that they should be marketed as toys... but they are not.
I am just salty because every ignorant douche swears by this logitech set up as some awesome controller.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They DID price match amazon's low price. I usually always shop at amazon. So, any product I buy and is sold here. I write a review for it. :)

I have played sim racers since Gran Turismo 1. I have used more than one wheel in the past with force feed back and without. This is by far the best I have used. I use this wheel with forza 6 and Dirt Rally. The wheel feels very very very responsive after adjusting the settings for one game at a time. You feel all the bumps, all the road textures, road and or surface tilt. You name it. Don't be skeptical, this is probably the value for your money. It's not cheap, I love the hand stitched leather wheel, the pedals are sturdy. Forget about those bad reviews about the brake pedal being too hard. I doubt those guys ever driven a var in real life. This is as good as it gets. You will love the for feedback!!!! It took me about 6 hour to dominate the lower class cars in forza. I beat all the stars in the reasonably priced car Vauxhall Astra top gear edition. My time was 1:44.5. Yeah!!! You will not regret your purchase, definitely get the shifter if you're as passionate about racing Sims like me. It's a great addition.

Follow up review Dec 15, 2015
After I updated the FW on my XBOX ONE, the wheel stopped working, and cannot be detected at all.  Oddly, on my PC Win10 the wheel is still recognized with my ""Project Cars"" game only.  F1 2015 can see the wheel but it will not function correctly. I have started my return for refund process but I cancelled the request in hopes that Logitech will have a firmware / driver patch later.

After doing some research I'm finding this is a very common issue, so common in fact that replacements often suffer the same issue. The G29's performance doesn't seem to be affected, as a wheel it's great for the price point but the squeak forces me to wear headphones or have the TV turned up. I held off on buying the G29 simply because its no different from the G27 aside from the button layout (and the needless incompatibility of the G27 & the PS4).

Both games I've loved playing with keyboard and mouse but ever since I received this product i've been extremely happy.

Let's start from the start....

I first looked into steering wheels over 2 weeks back. My friend had a G27 and watched 3 different videos on that product. I soon realized that with the amount of buttons and configurations that it had it would fit me for my needs in my games fine. I soon realized that the G27 is no longer available for purchase at least not brand new. I then saw the G29 VS G920 video. I soon began to realize that both of these wheels were the next gen for consoles with PC support. I looked at the G920 first and realized it didn't have as many button configurations that would allow me to play my trucking games the way I wanted. I then looked at the G29.

Now my system is a gaming laptop. I have only 3 USB slots ( which currently take up my mouse, keyboard, and USB adapter headset.) so I soon realized that I would have to drop my keyboard in order to use this. Now, I wanted to make sure that the G29 was compatible with a laptop and it's limited amount of power as well as usb slots. I ran across a video a week ago where a guy was installing the G29 into a laptop (randomly) and it worked. I purchased afterwords and received my product.

Weird thing with one of my games, which I believe is a game flaw, not a G29 flaw, is that I have to start up the game, unplug and replug my G29 back in to get auto centering and feedback into my wheel. Otherwise she's a loose goose that just turns wherever and doesn't auto center back. This is the smallest issue I could ever think of to have with this item so I am extremely happy.

Again, 72 hours later, I am still playing with it with only 4 hours of sleep. I'd better get back because those loads aren't going to travel themselves...","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_106?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=106&reviewerType=all_reviews"

There's a small rubber stopper inside the spring of the brake pedal that makes it impossible to press it all of the way down, therefore pressing it half way makes you brake 100%. The easy way to do this mod it to remove all the pedal ""covers first, meaning the 2 screws on the front of all the pedals. Then unscrew all the silver acres on the back of the assembly. Finally unscrew the long hex screw with a hex screwdriver and plyers. Take the rubber piece out of the spring. And reverse all the steps listed. Type joy.cpl I think to calibrate everything so it's 100% accurate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have had this for close to a year and it still works as perfectly as when I first bought it. I would recommend this wheel to all of my friends. It is worth the price.

----Some Games I Have Played Using This Wheel----
-Assetto Corsa
-Dirt Rally
-American Truck Simulator
-F1 2015

It works on a variety of games. However, the pedals have to be remapped initially when you first play. The H-Shifter is worth buying with it. It really does make the games more immersive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I haven’t gotten the game I plan to use it with yet, but I can tell you, the G920 is SOLID. I unboxed it and hooked it up, and could immediately tell that it was well worth the money. The motors inside the wheel do an amazing job! It feels like a real car. And the leather smell is a great perk 😉.
I’ve seen a lot of reviews here & on YouTube about the brake pedal resistance. I will say that yes, it is very high. However, over the past few hours I have been just pushing on it while watching tv & found that it is less resistant then it was out of the box, so my recommendation is to “break it in” (pun). It will get less resistant if you spend the time to just push as hard as you can on it for a while.
I’ll try to update when I receive the F1 game & actually use it with that, but it’s great so much as I can tell. Just wish it had the LED’s for shifting that the G29/PS4 has. Also, I wish the clamps for the steering wheel were a little better designed. Only complaint to give it 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Project Cars 2, which I already owned from a Steam Summer sale went form a ""meh, this is fun but I'm not into sim racing"" to ""Holy $h17, VR puts me in the car!"" to ""I need a wheel because VR racing with an Xbox 360 controller just doesn't cut it"".  Debated between this and the T150 and ended with the G29 mainly from a few reviews and the additional buttons on the wheel... also it was on sale that day.

My thoughts about the G29 itself...  Great size feel/grip from the wheel.  It feels substantial and weighty.  The force feedback is strong enough to give me the perception that I'm driving the real thing.  The weight of the pedals feel right and the sensitivity make me feel like I can be very precises with my throttle and breaking.  The button layout works and once you learn it, is easy to blindly manipulate in VR.  All in all, I'm very happy and would recommend this to anyone debating a 1st time wheel purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pros:
solid construction, this thing is built well
Strong feedback, you can dial it in but out of the box its strong, it isn't likely to break grown fingers, but it will let you know the road is a moving.
built in paddles for high end exotics, or for manual shifting without the extra shifter.

pedals are a bit close together, works best without shoes

Almost 2 weeks. At first I was God awful with it. There is a small learning curve. But after a week I pretty well have it mastered.
It's of very nice quality. I like the leather rim, the metal wheel, the aluminum paddle shifters. It really feels like this thing was built to last.
I like the feel of the clutch and gas pedal, however the brake pedal takes ALOT of getting used to.
I purchased the ad on shifter as well, which also seems like a nice piece with the leather boot and sleeve. However after a week of use, 4th gear doesn't wanna pop in very easily. But I won't drop stars in this review since it's not included.
Now as an FYI I've only used this wheel so far with Forza Motorsport 6 and Forza Horizon 3 and it does work great for both, but I can't speak for other games. I plan to try Project Cars 2 and Asseto Corsa here soon. So I've heard, the wheel support for those games is far superior to Forza so there is no reason it shouldn't work.

If you're looking for an entry level wheel for the Xbox One, this so far has been a great buy and I highly recommend it. Especially over something like ThrustMasters Ferrari wheel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sadly this is a downgrade to me. The wheel is not smooth, you can feel the gears jump and grind and the wheel is BRAND NEW. Profiler system for this wheel is not as good/easy as G27. The gas pedal is soft and the brake pedal is HARD and requires too much force. This is in the pedal set itself. I'm going to rebuild my G27 with new BRASS encoder and new Bodner cables then placed the G920 on ebay.

I bought this specifically for PC gaming.

I had a lot of racing games sitting in my Steam library, and I said to myself, ""one of these days, I'll buy a wheel and play them"". I finally bit the bullet and did it.

Unfortunately (as I found out after my purchase), there have been a lot of changes to the software in the G29 model. It's rendered the wheel incompatible with many of the racing games prior to 2015. It didn't serve the purpose that I bought it for, so I've returned it.

I gave it 3/5 because, physically, it seems like a solid wheel. The grip was good and it felt comfortable. I had no problems with assembly or attaching it securely to my desk. My only minor gripe is that there wasn't much distance between the brake and clutch. When you look at other similar racing pedals, it looks about typical, so that may have just been a comfort thing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

pro:
-great leather feel
-metal frame work
-awesome range
-force  feed back is quite strong
-was plug and play on ps4
-clips that are on the clamps are removable (however are hard to remove)
-lots of programable buttons
-has a clutch
-break pedal has resistance to it
-supported on lots of games
-pedals are metal
-adjustable clamps that mount to table and hold tight

cons
-the force feedback sometime feels like it doesn't translate the resistance very well. in some cases the wheel is choppy, rather than a consistent resistance
-The wheel can be loud and makes a grinding sound that sounds like it breaking.
-the base and clamps are made of plastic and feel cheap
-although the clamps are great at holding on to the table, the pegs you turn to tighten the clamps are plastic and are slippery. this make it difficult to remove if you over tighten. on top of that when the pegs can be brought down in to the base but sometime get stuck.
-if you are playing on pc you need to install a program before you can use it.
-lastly the wheel size is kinda small, and feel a bit awkward","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This has to be the best wheel I have ever used and the force feedback is great and also the steering is nice but there is one thing that bugs  me which is that the pedals the break is quite hard or really hard and it makes the whole pedal set slide with is a problem but other things it is great and it also works great on forza horizon 3 and forza motorsport 7 which is the games that I play right now. And also this wheel when I checked has a lower force feed back thing but when I used it it was great everything felt right. And speaking of what felt right I would say the wheel size is also nice. It is not too big to handle and not too small for a child. And also this wheel has one of the best looks I have ever seen on a steering wheel. There is also another version which is the g29 which is the same thing but for the ps4. I think that wheel looks likes a kids toy because of the bluish design but on this wheel everything looks right especially the quality on the wheel and the pedals. With mainly mental the wheel is great and just feels like it would live really long. And also I think that this wheel specifically is a good price for this great wheel because of you seen something like this and if it is from fanatec it would be a lot more expensive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Logitech G920 Racing Wheel is an amazing thing, and will increase your favorite racing sim fun-factor 10-fold!  With its leather-wrapped rim, anodized aluminum face, and brushed aluminum paddle shifters, this wheel is certainly a gorgeous thing to behold; much better looking than any of its competitors or its sister wheel, the G29.  The pedals themselves are very heavy duty, made of I believe brushed aluminum (pedal faces) and stainless steel, and have taken all the punishment I've doled out since its first use with ease.  This is truly a quality product.  I use this with an Xbox One, and so far have been playing the s*** out of Forza Horizon 2.  The force feedback has been great; not at all weak as some vocal minority have said.  You feel every bump, you feel under/oversteer, you feel damn near every little thing that your virtual car goes through.  It's simply amazing, especially with a good quality headset.  I built a custom gaming rig (which I HIGHLY recommend) that I use with this.  I have the pedal inverted which makes for better pedal feel.  All in all, this setup is wonderful and I highly recommend it for any racing sim enthusiast out there!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Particularly the wheel is not fast enough to emulate the real feeling of the grip of the tires as you drive at the limit. In real life If I exceed the tires grip I can make lightnig fast corrections to reblance weight to regain grip. On this wheel once I exceed the limit there is this dead zone where the wheel / programming doesn't know what to do and I'm spinning out like a noob regardless of the corrections I make.

Even turning the force feedback and centering spring off only helps a little, but then what's the point of spending the extra money? It's better on ps4 than pc. I though it was defective but when I looked around I found almost everyone has the same problem with it. Don't waste your money I returned mine.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_152?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=152&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It took far too long to set up and has already broken 5 times and I’ve had to spend hours fixing it. Now the pedals (namely the clutch) have just stopped responding all together.

Williams","Love my Wheel & Pedals","January 10, 2019","This is my fifth wheel and pedal setup (Not including the silly wii wheel.) I love the G29. As I've said, I've owned several other setups. (Still do, if anyone is looking for an older setup.) This the best I've ever had. Maybe someday I'll be able to afford one of those $400 or $500 sim wheels. I've been playing racing sims since the original Papyrus Indy Car game came out.

All of the devices I've had before are somewhat ""clunky."" The wheel was not smooth and it was difficult to be precise when running three or four wide. You'd often end up tagging the wall or sliding across the grass due to the motion of the wheel. The force feedback wasn't very precise either. Sometimes you'd get a real jerk on the wheel. Other times, you wouldn't feel anything at all.

This is all corrected with the G29. While you can still feel the individual gear cogs meshing with each other, the feeling is unnoticable while you're racing. The movement of the wheel is much more smooth and the force feedback is very consistent.

I highly recommend the Logitech Dual-Motor Feedback Driving Force G29 Racing Wheel with Responsive Pedals for Playstation 4 and Playstation 3 to any racing sim enthusiast. I also recommending getting the matching shifter for it.

The only con to this setup is that the pedals are a little too close together. I have a Size 12 foot with a narrow instep, and average foot width. It is difficult not to hit the clutch and brake at the same time. When using the right foot to brake, it's hard to completely clear the accelerator when going for the brake. I've purchased some racing style shoes and this makes it feel a little better. The pedals are smooth and made of metal. I love that the metal is quality and makes the pedals feel very durable and more realistic. However, you have to wear shoes of some type or it is easy to have your foot slide off of the pedals.

I still highly recommend the Logitech Dual-Motor Feedback Driving Force G29 Racing Wheel with Responsive Pedals. purchase and go racing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_147?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=147&reviewerType=all_reviews"

At this price, I think you have to make a tough decision on how much you love sim racing.

I have good personal experience with Logitech wheels, having owned both the G27 and the GT Driving Force. The GT Driving Force put against this is made the GT a definite toy. But G29 is a class on its own no matter what you compare against. And to get this out of the way: I definitely do not miss the manual shifter, since it was never really all that useful in the G27, even less so with these modern games and modern cars. However, for it to be optional but no apparent reduction in price is unfortunate. Furthermore, the 3rd pedal still comes along anyway, which is kind of a waste of space, added cost, and just plain in the way.

But boy these pedals are shiny! The construction is superb. I think Logitech pulled all the stop. The blue on the wheel is a very nice touch. It's got a very premium feel, and I'm glad to they have improved on all aspects of the G27, instead of trying to cut corners and cost (except the H gate :) ).

What I love the most is how quiet the wheel is. When it autoturns for calibration, it's as if nothing is happening. This is a big plus in my book. Love it.

My gripes are limited to how this product is crippled on the PS3: the rev counter does not work (tested in GT6). This is so unfortunate. The flash on startup, but not usable in the game. Also, the ""Select"" and ""Start"" buttons are replaced by ""Share"" and ""Options"" button on the wheel. It is what it is I guess.

I have gotten used to the D-pad being above the wheel, instead of the GT where level with the horn (this G29 has no horn in middle). I wish they were further down each time I use them, but I can live with them sitting above. It's nice to have the L and R buttons in front of me (though the little blue buttons look bit goofy), instead of behind the wheel in the GT wheel.

In a nutshell, if you can afford this, congratulations, you just found the perfect wheel for your PlayStation. If you can't right now, wait for a used one because the quality of this thing means it will last ages.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_152?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=152&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They don't. The brake pedal can only achieve 50% braking if you stand on it with so much force it feels like you are going to break something. Normal heavy braking force gets you do about 8 percent. It is idiotic and undriveable. There is no way to adjust sensitivity enough to allow for full brake travel. It's a design flaw. There is a rubber bushing inside the spring in the pedal mechanism that is designed to give feedback. It is too large for Forza. You have two choices. Return the set for something else, or remove the rubber completely/cut it to between 50 an 75 percent of it's original length. The person at Logitech responsible for testing this should be fired.

The price has since gone back to $399.99... I have it mounted on a Playseat evolution.

Pros: It works with PS3, PS4 and PC. I've only tested this on PS4 playing DriveClub and Project Cars. In both games, the wheel is fantastic out of the box and can be modified to the user's preferences, more so in Project Cars than in DriveClub but never the less...

The force feedback is pretty good. This is my first wheel of the kind so I have no prior experience to compare it to but I think most gamers would appreciate it.

The pedals are better than anything out there at this price range. Compared to the T300 which comes with plastic pedals and no clutch, the Logitech pedals are very sturdy and work well.

The buttons on the wheel are excellent for PS4 and let you navigate around without needing the standard controller. The wheel can't power on the PS4 though, I've noticed. So I usually use the dualshock to turn it on and then login with the wheel.

Mounting to a playseat: the wheel itself is pretty easy to mount. The screw holes lined up perfectly with the platform on the chair however the pedals where a bit more challenging. I managed to mount the pedals with 2 screws but it took some effort to get it going. The screw holes will not easily line up with the pedals and you will have to spend some time looking for them.. but in the end, it does mount.

Looks: the wheel is leather wrapped and feels solid. the buttons are good enough. The pedals are metal and they look and feel like they can take a beating. The paddle shifters are of good quality; better quality than my car in real life that has plastic paddle shifters.

Cons: The obvious one is the not including a shifter and selling it for $400. Like I said earlier, i bought mine for $286.99 so I'm satisfied but for $400, they really should include the shifter.

The wheel itself is a little small. Once you start playing, you will forget that and won't care much but they really should make it a little bit bigger

Overall, I'm pretty happy with the purchase. I was between this and the Thrustmaster T300. In the end, the discounted price on amazon is what sealed the deal for me on this wheel. I figured it was worth a try and if I didn't like it, I would return it. I really enjoy it so far.

I have about 10 hours of playing time on it and haven't encountered any issues. A lot of people claim the G29 build is a refresh of the G27 model for PS3 and PC that has a pretty good reliability record.

I'm taking one star for the size of the wheel and not including a shifter. Otherwise, this is a great wheel and a must have if you really want to enjoy playing racing games. I don't think I can go back to playing a racing game with a traditional controller, ever.

One thing to keep in mind: a lot of the reviews you will read, no necessarily on amazon, come from former Logitech G27 owners who are seemingly angry with Logitech for not upgrading the software on their wheels to make it compatible with PS4. While I fully understand their complaint and I would be too if I was in their position, it shouldn't take away from how good the G29 is for PS4. My experience has been a pleasant one and I hope it will be as reliable as the G27 models that so many people seem to be fond of.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_122?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=122&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When I tried to use it with either Horizon 2 or Forza 5 it would start out working, but within seconds it would show as disconnected on the screen then the wheel would go through its auto calibration procedure as though one had just connected the USB cord.

It would repeatedly disconnect, calibrate, work for a few seconds then repeat the cycle again. I did connect it to my Win 7 PC and installed the latest firmware on it, but that didn't help. The only fix was to return it and buy the ThrustMaster TMX Force Feedback wheel, which works very nicely except for the light weight pedals that slide around the carpet all the time.

The Logitech G920 wheel seemed to be nicely built and stayed in place on the carpet, but the repeated disconnects from Xbox One made it unusable for me.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_140?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=140&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Service","January 15, 2017","The Logitech G29 Force Feedback Wheel and Pedals combination is great.  The force feedback really makes you work a little harder when playing a racing game.  It gives you a more realistic experience overall.  The pedals are very sturdy and give you a realistic feel when using them.  I have used a different wheel and pedal combo before and it was nowhere near as realistic as these are.  Even the Brake pedal gets stiffer the more you push on it.
Now my only complaint on this product has nothing to do with the operation of the wheel or pedals (to an extent that is).  When it arrived I took everything out of the box and checked everything out to make sure it was all there and nothing missing.  The thing that was missing was the operator’s manual.  There was only two sheet of paper that were in the box.  One showed what wires when where, and the other was the warnings page.  So I thought well maybe they have it on their site in a PDF like a lot of companies are doing now.  NOPE! I looked for almost a half an hour and stopped there because all they were doing was making me go around in circles (and that ticks me off).  So I then emailed customer service and the response I got back was “if you want to know anything go to our forum pages and look it up there”.  What the heck?
 I know it’s pretty straight forward on how to use it, but I thought there might be some settings or other things that could be of use. Nope.  So although it is a great wheel and pedal combo and works well, I am only inclined to give it 3 stars due to first: no operator’s manual, and second: VERY poor customer service.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_116?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=116&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I spent extensive time interacting with customer service and they informed me that I should just return the wheel and order a new one, since ""it should work"". After getting a second G920, I had the same experience with Logitech support recommending that I get another, but instead I ordered a Thrustmaster. Logitech is simply gambling. They develop and manufacture a product, and by doing minimal testing, they think they can claim their product works for both platforms, but in reality, there are either none or few that actually do. I know testing for PC is not easy, but don't bother making claims of PC compatibility unless you know it's going to work for 99.99% of the customers. I got the impression from Logitech customer service that the percentage of success is closer to 30%. The larger percentage of their customers that buy the wheel for Xbox are entirely oblivious and thus give a good rating.

First the wheel itself, The G29 is flawless in fit and finish, all of the buttons are very well thought out and placed in the perfect location for me, the leather wrapped wheel is extemely comfortable and the force feedback feels like a real vehicle, I race mostly in VR and the buttons are easily accessible without looking, the paddle shifters are velvety smooth and made of high quality stainless steel, the wheel has very smooth ball bearings and even the chassis of the wheel is made of metal.
 The pedals. The pedal set is also very high quality, the brake pedal gives a nice feel, the clutch is also very nice, not exactly the same as a real sports car but close. The pedals themselves have all steel construction underneath the plastic housing making them very solid giving you the confidence to really put your foot on the brake without the worry of damage. All in all this is a great wheel and pedal set. The pros and cons

Bought the g920 instead of the TX because it was a $100 cheaper, 2 year warranty, and I've read that this thing will last forever.

The pedals worked
Cons -
Wheel was defective
Customer support

I bought this wheel a while ago and all was well in games that didn't use more then 90° of rotation.  When you spend 200+ on something like this you expect it to show up in excellent condition since it was listed as new.  Once I hooked it up and started playing American truck simulator I went to turn the wheel and it activated every button.  Tried contacting seller about the issue but didn't get any response.  So I tried to disable all the buttons on the wheel itself and not even 20 mins later then thing started smoking.  I decided to take the wheel apart to see where the smoke was coming from and noticed the 7 pin connector had melted and synged all the wires. I noticed other buyers experiencing the same issue based off of older reviews but I figured they would have got some newer ones that wasn't defective based on the good reviews. Sorry for the rambling i just want to warn buyers about the defect in these wheels before you cough up the dough to get one.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Wheel:

Good size, all of the standard PS4 buttons (with four additional programmable if your game allows it), nice tension, and POWERFUL force-feedback.

The Pedals:

Solid design, good tension, nice base, light weight.

Overall:

Great wheel-and-pedal if a bit expensive. The forcefeed back is really powerful if the PS4 game can drive it...the strongest FF I've found was in F1-2017. The force-feedback in F1 on PS4 is strong enough to make the wheel very heavy to where my shoulder is fatigued after a race for two. There's a bit of play and looseness in the steering wheel and it's not as smooth as the more high-end racing SIM wheels. There also bit of a ""grinding"" feel as the belt works against the force-feedback that doesn't feel realistic and can be distracting; but it's about as good as you are going to get without paying nearly $1k for a professional sim controller.

My one minor criticism is with the C-clamps they use for the desk mounts. While the clamps are fairly strong and durable, they use a spring tension knob on top which doesn't lend itself to getting this thing really locked down. It's extremely frustrating to have this thing pop off in your lap while you are racing. I would have preferred if they had designed the c-clamps to use an allen-wrench or T-Knob so you can get this tighter. But it works with some effort.

My suggestion for use: take a gripping pad (or a glove) and wrench down the knobs on top as tight as you can get it. You can get the clamp pretty tight without breaking them, so use some muscl.. Additionally, I use a piece of double-sided carpet tape on the bottom-back area (where the cables come out) to give it a bit of extra stick to the desk. This helps keep the back end from lifting up during the race and adds a bit of rigidity to the whole thing. I'd also suggest adding some softer rubber feet to the bottom as the hard plastic ones will rattle your desk and annoy anyone who isn’t actually playing with you.

Other than that, my other criticism would be with the fact that they made the back edge of the pedal platform curved…which looks nice, but if you brace it against a straight surface (like a wall or desk frame), then the curved edge causes the pedal platform to rotate a bit.

Ultimately, to get the most bang out of this, you need a more permanent mounting solution (like one of the racing mounts); but it gets the job done and is a blast to use in game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pushing 120lb of force on the brake still only gets it to 90%. I heard cracking and hope it didn't break itself. It's the same stiffness as the clutch til 35% then it's just hard and useless. That's not how brakes feel. I don't want to void the warranty so I'm forced to use a pedal with 35% travel and set the deadzone enough to compensate.

The rest of the wheel is good. Good build quality. Looks good. Works good. There is the notchiness from the helical gear but I already knew that before buying. The paddle shifters have too much wiggle room and need a more snappy feel like real paddle shifters.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Estrada","Brake issues are real. Swerve around this turd.","February 13, 2016","Hated this product. The wheel is obviously quality; wrapped in nice leather and with a nice and heavy feel. The goodness stopped there as once you start racing (Forza 6) you realize the brake pedal issues other users write about is no joke. It was impossible to brake effectively as the pedal doesn't depress fully, and in trying to do so you push yourself away from the wheel instead. I adjusted the brake sensitivity in-game, but all that's really doing is turning the brakes into an on-off switch, not the precise tool that you deftly touch to achieve all the nuance Forza is known for. I saw some users remove a certain pad from the brake mechanism itself, but for $400 I shouldn't have to do that (and void the warranty in the process). How could this product be released without quality control? Buy at your own risk.

When they stay functioning properly. As an ""entry"" level gaming wheel, I don't expect the highest quality materials, design, etc. but I do expect the product to be able to withstand normal day to day use. After literally a day of use, the steering wheel started making this terrible squealing/whistling sound when turning. After investingating online, it seems like this is a common problem with this wheel and Logitech hasn't seemed to address it. It seems there is a fix that has been posted on YouTube, but why risk voiding your warranty to disassemble the wheel? I'd rather not deal with this product all together. If you're able to get a wheel that doesn't have this product defect, it should serve you well as a good racing wheel but I don't think it's worth the $250-300 for a product that's defective after less than 24 hours of owning.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's my first wheel so bare that in mind but I was blown away by how good it.  I don't regret my purchase at all and trust me I would if anything was wrong because this is the most money i've ever spent on video games.  There's complaints about the brake pedal.  I felt it too and it was a problem until I found out you can adjust the sensitivity in the options menu of all racing games. SO my advice is do NOT listen to anyone telling you to remove the cork or whatever it is in the break pedal.  Simply go to the options menu and adjust the sensitivity of your break.  For those that dont know people were complaining that it took A LOT of pressure to push the brake in all the way. SO much that you'd end up pushing your chair backwards before breaking like you wanted.  Its cuz of a cork that's in there so peope would open it up and remove it. But I didn't do that, I just adjusted the sensitivity of my brake in the menu and it works great.  The cork is great actually because you can slam on the brake in those crazy moments and it won't harm your pedals cuz the cork takes the force.
The one down side is that on Consoles you can only use the stick add on that Logitech sells.  Which is fine, I have it and it matches the wheel perfectly.  The negative part is that there's more expensive cooler shifters (about $150 ouch) that won't work with this wheel.  Who cares though right when it's that expensive.  The shifter that you can buy as an add on for this wheel is about $40 -$60.  So some might not even see it as a negative and see the more reasonable price of the shifter as a positive. I have it and like it but even if you don't you can always just use the paddle shifters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I would have gave it five stars but the reason is it does not have a setup to use the paddle shifts for an auto transmission, on some tracks you have downshift instead of braking, when you tap the brake to down shift it gets you in trouble.car makers did`nt put those gear select numbers there for nothing they are there so you can down shift manually or up shift manually. It is not a hard fix Logitech just needs to program the wheel to use the paddles to up and down shift with the paddles on a auto transmission then do an update to the settings on the setup settings. over all I am happy with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_100?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=100&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Works great in WIN 10 64bit, Project Cars 2.  Downloaded the latest Logitech Gaming Software and it set up everything without any hassle.  I haven't plugged the G29 in to my PS4 yet so I'll update this review as I use the wheel.  The stiff brake pedal is no problem for me and I actually prefer it over a looser pedal;  to me it feels more like a brake pedal should.  I don't feel that I have to jam my foot that much harder but instead it gives me a much more progressive control over braking.  I upgraded from a Logitech Driving Force GT which still works great and has been a great wheel for me; I've had it for years, can't remember how long and it also worked flawlessly in WIN 10, so I'm hoping this wheel will last as long.  One tip I would give people concerning warranties; if you used a credit card to purchase many times your CC company will extend your warranty by as much as two years.  I use a VISA and they offer this.  So if your original warranty runs out your credit card company will probably offer you an extended warranty beyond the manufacturers.  Check it out on your CC company's website.  Also, sometimes they will price match in that if you find a price lower within 90 days they will reimburse you the difference.  I haven't used this service but it is stated on my CC company's website and I  have talked with a rep on the phone about it.  Do your homework and check out their website to see what they're providing you as a card holder.

Update June 30, 2018.  The Wheel still works great.  What I've found is that it doesn't like to be plugged in to any other USB other than the one I first installed it on.  The Logitech Gaming Software doesn't like this either so just plug in to the same USB  slot every time.  Also, in Project Cars 2 I actually had to assign the pedals to an axis before they would be recognized.  After assigning them they worked fine and I was able to calibrate.  I've been using the wheel a lot and feel it's been an upgrade from my Driving Force GT; which is also a great wheel that I'm going to hold on to.  I also still like the brake pedal the way it came and don't feel I have to remove it.  I have had no problems using it and I still prefer it over a less stiff pedal.  I still highly recommend this wheel and am having a great time using it.  If I have problems I'll update this review.

Update July 10 2018.  Wheel works great still.  I installed a USB 3.0 card in my computer and the LG29 plugged in to that with no problems.  However, when I booted up the computer today the wheel didn't power on and did not show up in the Log Gaming Profile.  I plugged it in to a USB 2.0 port and only the wheel was recognized, not the pedals.  I then plugged it in to the original USB 2.0 port when I first installed the wheel and everything came up recognized.  I think it likes to be plugged in to exactly the same port it was installed on.  Wheel still works great and I'm really enjoying it.  I believe this will work fine with USB 3.0, you just might have to unplug it and then plug it back in every time.  I'm choosing to keep it plugged in all the time to the original USB 2.0 port.

Update July 9, 2018:  Wheel works flawlessly on Win 10 and I'm able to plug it in to just about any USB port, both 2.0 and 3.0, and have it recognized.  Like any wheel you'll need to tune it to your liking.  I'm very happy with this wheel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Return and replacement from Amazon was quick and painless. Second one did not make the high pitched noise. I've seen this problem in several reviews and forums. I was tempted to just live with it, almost didn't return as defective. Very glad the second unit did not have this issue (edit: it does after a couple of days)

Pedals and wheel are good for the price. Force feedback is strong except in the center for about 10 degrees, where there is none. I understand this is a design limitation based on the dual force feedback motors. It is very noticeable in a truck simulator, hardly noticeable at all in a rally racing game. Depends on what you are playing.

I would consider this wheel the ""high end"" of the video game controller spectrum. Not as good at all as the low end of the racing simulator spectrum, but you get what you pay for.

Update 4/27/17: second wheel started making the same squeaking noise when turning left after a couple of days. The noise is less consistent than the first. Also noticed the red toggle wheel is much stickier on this one and much less clicky, meaning less feedback to know how many clicks you've adjusted brake balance, engine braking, or whatever you have it set to. I will be keeping this unit but dropping to 3 stars due to inconsistent build quality and the squeaking noise.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_80?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=80&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought it for sim trucking and racing and I absolutely love it. The quality of the product is really good, the steering wheel is wrapped in leather, and the center portion of the wheel is a really durable metal. The software is really simple to use and you can tune your settings very easily. Only thing that I didn’t like was the brake pedal is very stiff. It’s really hard to brake with just the stock settings due to how hard it is.

By the way, Logitech tech support in trying to troubleshoot my G27 wheel was not very good. The G920 wheel is basically an updated version of the G27 with new buttons, etc. to allow play on either pc or the Xbox. Both the wheel and the shifter are again well made and work well. I avoided the issue of the G920 having a stiffer brake pedal by simply continuing to use my G27 pedals which are identical. The H shifter appears to be interchangeable with the G27 too, however the extra game buttons on the G27 shifter don't work with the G920. Also as others have noted the G920 has a little white LED power light on the lower wheel spoke which is too bright and a distraction. I solved this with a small piece of black electrical tape with a tiny slot in it so I can just see the power light.

I'm using the G920 on a higher end Dell XPS 8500 desktop pc with core i7 and NVIDIA GeForce GT640. Again as others have noted using the G920 on a pc is not that easy. The wheel comes with the new Logitech Gaming Software which comes up with a new very nice graphic control panel and then automatically detects your games on first start up. But then creating a game profile and settings becomes much more complicated than with the old and much simpler profiler . . .I still haven't figured it out but have been able to use the wheel well with some games (e.g. NFS Shift and NFS Shift 2 Unleashed) by just programming the wheel within the game. Two apparent significant shortcomings in the new Logitech software are the inability to select separate or combined pedals and the inability to assign functions to the H shifter ""buttons"" 12 thru 18 (even though the H shifter is now a separate $60 purchase). I finally did find in the ""Settings"" option for the wheel that you can still set wheel degrees of rotation from 0 - 900.

Bottom line is that it is a very nice and well built wheel/pedal/shifter combination which is a pleasure to use for the games you can get it to work with. However, if you have a G27 that's still working I recommend staying with it until (hopefully) Logitech  makes some needed software changes to make the G920wheel more compatible with pc's.

UPDATE 2-21-16: Just added ""Project Cars"" to my racing game collection and am pleased to say the new G920 seems to be fully integrated and works great with this game, Logitech Gaming software picked it up immediately when scanned for new games. When I went to set up controls within the game the G920 was specifically recognized (including separate pedals and the ""H"" shifter) with the control assignment page even showing an exact replication of the G920 wheel and buttons.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_65?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=65&reviewerType=all_reviews"

While there are many good reports regarding this wheel on the XBOX, using the wheel with a PC is another story.  Read the Logitech Community forums before buying this wheel for a PC.  Some folks have gotten it to work using games which communicate directly with the wheel and not a driver.  Presently, there is no good Windows driver for this wheel.  I believe the G29 has the same issue.  When contacted, Logitech has only offered non-solutions in spite of the out-cry from users since its release (9/2015).  I am sure that Logitech will address the problem eventually and is probably a fantastic product when they do.  However, I am done waiting and am returning the G920 for a refund.

Pros: Very nice build quality (which is why 2 stars and not 1).  That is all I can say since it is not working.

Cons: Does not work yet on a PC.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_65?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=65&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I ordered the G29 instead of G920 just because I liked the blue better than gray. I am a Linux PC user. The game did not recognize it in Linux, but recognized it as a G29 in Win7 and it worked great. Back to Linux and eventually I figured out that if I change it to an alternate mode in Linux from G29 to G27, DiRT Rally recognized it and I wrote a script to switch its mode and set lock to lock in degrees. Then everything worked including wheel with force feedback, paddle shifters, and all 3 pedals. So I am enjoying DiRT Rally with a lot better control and feedback of track surface. Linux DiRT Rally should support the G29 in its next update. Until then the Linux shell script to switch The G29 to G27 and set its range is posted in the Steam Linux Force Feedback (LinuxFF) group.

I cannot believe people disable the brake pedal resistance. Anyone who drives a real car knows that the brake pedal has resistance when you get to a certain point and that if you stand on the brake 100% you are likely to lock up your tires (unless you have ABS). And any sensible game should have settings to set at what range you get 100% braking if you want that to happen with less pressure. But I like it the way it is, have ABS disabled in DiRT Rally, and still occasionally lock up my tires if I am too hard on the brakes. But I am familiar with threshold braking without ABS in real competition driving, so that suits me fine, I simply know to ease up on the brake if the wheels start to lock.

So Logitech racing wheels may not be inexpensive, but add to the realism of racing if the game gets it right. That does not mean that you will not crash, but eventually you will become a better driver with finer control.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_57?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=57&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, since I had a very positive experience with the prior version model (which won't work with the PS4 - licensing issue) I decided to buy it.  After using it for over 30 hours, it works very well.  A solid improvement over my previous version.  BTW, it has a switch that allows you to use it with PS3 as well.

The primary reason I bought it was to use with Gran Turismo Sport.  It does the job very well!

I had an amazing time with this wheel, and the Logitech quality was thorough. The force feedback is way stronger than you think, too! This thing could pretty much pull me out of place!

The pedals and shifter work, but the steering axis and feedback don't. As far as I can tell from the internet, this is a power delivery issue. But no matter where I plug it in or reset all the places it connects, it still won't work...

I’ve owned this wheel twice, first time it was used and the second was from Amazon brand new. You can tell the the motors do wear out from use but it’s very minimal. When I purchased this wheel, I was expecting either a used or refurbished wheel but I got a new wheel for less than $200 including shipping & tax.

Right after i power out the wheel is supposed to spin back just like a real car.. it stays in one place and i crash. Logitech was no help so before amazon can put me through another game of sherades for a return i kust went ahead, boxed it right back up and now im waiting for a refund. Very disappointed. Theres a reason the price dropped 50%  because everyone is having the same issue. Save your mkney do some research and find a better wheel. And also.. dont buy anything expensive from amazon.

If you pay $500 with shipping for this wheel you are getting a terrible deal. It's a solid wheel that requires some setup to get it exactly how you want it. The pedals are mediocre though. It's worth $350 max. At $500 you can get some other wheels that have better pedals like the thrust master VG TX. I still have it 4 stars but that's at a reasonable price. If you have $500 to spend is suggest you keep shopping and take a good look at a thrust master VG setup which allows you to upgrade to different wheels and pedals and their shifter is superior than the Logitech.

That said, I love this racing wheel - it absolutely changes the experience for any racing game.

First off, I'd note that this isn't some flimsy plastic contraption - it's a solidly built wheel, made of metal and wrapped in genuine leather - just like a real steering wheel.  The pedals are similarly realistic - while they aren't totally identical to those I use with my stick-shift car, they are a really good approximation, and they are pressure sensitive to boot.  It rather seems that the only difference between braking when playing Xbox and braking my car is that I don't fly forward when braking using the racing wheel!  One caution is that the pedal pad can slip when you are applying a lot of force - I have a nice rug under my unit, but if you have hardwood or vinyl flooring you might want to consider how to anchor the unit.  Also, make sure that you have a decently heavy table or other surface to anchor the wheel itself to - otherwise it will go all over the place.

Shifting - there is a separate stick shift unit that costs another $69 or so, not included with the racing wheel itself.  Why - I don't know - this unit costs enough already.  Anyway, I guess because this is an ""authentic"" race car simulator, shifting is accomplished using paddle shifters to go up or down, in connection with the clutch pedal, of course.  This works well, and again, I guess it's authentic because some race cars use paddle shifters, but I prefer a separate stick shift myself.  I'm just not in the mood to shell out additional cash for that.

Perhaps the coolest feature of this wheel is the way it provides ""force feedback"" - when you turn during a race, the wheel reacts as if you were really in a car driving over that terrain - so it can ""fight you"" or whatever.  Very cool.  The force feedback is transformative - it really makes driving games more engaging and realistic.  A ""wow"" experience.  And it seems to really help the times and experience as well.  When you go off the course or collide, the wheel can really jerk around.  Sure, it's not like you're in a car getting thrown around, but it really does change the dynamic.

I'd note that there are stands that you can purchase for this wheel as well.  I obviously don't have one, but if you're a SERIOUS gamer I think that's definitely something to consider - the peddles and the steering wheel can shift in the heat of game play - but its also a significant additional expense.

In all, I can truly say that the Logitech wheel is awesome.  At a price that's almost equal to that of an Xbox unit itself, however, you need to ask just how serious you are about racing games before taking the plunge.

Now, I use this wheel with Forza 6.  Initially, it was a pain in the butt to deal with - Forza 6 didn't make it easy to set the wheel up.  So eventually I learned that you had to play enough games that an ""option"" menu appeared.  Then you need to exit Forza 6, make sure the wheel is plugged in and recognized by the Xbox One, and restart Forza 6.  You then need to use the wheel to start up, and you need to go to the options menu and make sure the wheel is recognized.  From there, you're good to go.  But it was a frustrating pain in the ____ to deal with.  Not Logitech's fault, by the way.

Forza 6 does allow a lot of customization for the wheel.  I am not that serious of a racer, so I haven't done that yet, but the option is there.

I can say this - every one of my kids' friends who comes over is entranced by the wheel.  So the only downside is that we have a steady stream of kids headed to our basement to play.  I guess there are worse problems to have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_149?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=149&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have always been curious about the G29 and now that my girls are older at age 9, I wanted to add some distraction to their existing hobbies and lead them into the fun of sim racing.

I remember my first wheel experience wasn’t that great back in the day. We didn’t have sim rigs, we had TV stands or you slide the wheel desk under your legs and the pedal tray kept moving around on you. It would have been great but I returned my first unit and opted for the friendly PS controller.

Fast forward to Forza when the new Microsoft XBOX 360 wheel came out. I tried it and really loved it. The pedal desk stayed in place on carpet, I had a desk to clamp the wheel to and it was a blast. I then ventured into a Playseat with it and fast forward many years I’m not in a full PC setup with DD wheel, motion, transducers, VR, and widescreen monitor. My hobby really envolved, but it all really started with the XBOX 360 wheel with it’s simplicity of plug and play and just plain working with enough FFB ques to make it fun.

Now my girls are getting into Sim Racing or at least show interest so I’m starting with w Logitech G29 for their first ride!

So….I spent about 1 week with the Logitech G29 and for its price point of $208 on Amazon, I find it’s a really great buy. I mean you really can’t go wrong with it. It’s low price, looks great, works great and want to twist my kid's arms off while using it.

Let's get into the complete review, shall we?

First up….

Aesthetics:
• Good looking wheelbase and pedals for the price of $208 on Amazon
• Love the smell of the leather rim
• Love the metal pedals
• Has a real plastic and toy-like feel in person.

Build:
• Quality construction with some heft to the wheelbase and pedals.
• Metal brake & Shifter pedals
• Hand-stitched Leather Rim
• Adequate pedal resistance in all 3 pedals.
• Surprisingly quiet operation.
• Helical Gearing has some cogging, but really smooth

Features:
• PS3, PS4, and PC Compatible
• Hard mount option
• Desk mount solution
• Should work on XBOX One with the Collective Minds Drivehub
• 900° rotation
• 2.2 NM of Torque
• LED indicator
• 14 pushbuttons, plus Dpad, rotary dial and paddle shifters.
• 3 pedal kit with the clutch, simulated load cell rake pedal(not a true load cell) and throttle

Pros:
• Low-cost entry wheel kit solution for PS3, PS4 and PC use.
• Don’t need an elaborate or expensive sim rig to use. Mount to wheel stand or desk
• Light enough to be portable to friends house along with your PS4
• Good FFB effects for curbing, wheel slip and wheel centering in games like Assetto Corsa and PCARS 2. GT Sport has weak FFB with this wheel, but it also does with others I tested.
• Plug and Play. No PC updates needed, everything just works out of the box.
• The mass majority of racing game that supports wheels already have Logitech G29 wheel support natively.
• Light enough forces to not hurt younger kids when in use.
• Hard mount and desk mount solutions. Desk mount clamp actually works.

Cons:
• Carpet ant-slide doesn’t really work. Need to add a block behind the pedals to keep from moving.
• The slight dead zone in the middle of the wheel before feeling forces.

Thoughts.

I bought this wheel kit for my kids to get into sim racing and to play with GT Sport for myself. I didn’t want to spend to much just to play GT Sport and my kids certainly at age 9 do not need the heavy wheel forces of a Fanatec CSL and others like it.

I was still disappointed with the FFB in GT Sport, but that’s defiantly a factor from the game itself, not the G29. Even with my Fanatec Clubsport V2 with a Drivehub, GT Sport FFB was very disappointing. At least with the G29, you don’t break the bank for such limited experience. It’s a shame because GT Sport is very fun, just lacking in FFB and feel compared to even PCARS2.

Speaking of PCARS 2. On my PC I tested PCARS2 and Assetto Corsa Competizione and both games didn’t disappoint with the G29. Sure they are not wrist breaking forces but did offer up plenty of curb feel, wheel slip and centering spring to have me turning fast laps around the track as if I was using a higher-end wheel. Plus all the button controls just worked. No mapping needed.

For the price of $208 on Amazon, I highly recommend this wheel for newcomers to sim racing for PS4 or PC usage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

And now for why I can’t recommend the Logitech G920: the pedals are just not up to par. Upon unboxing the Logitech I was blown away with how the wheel and pedals looked. The leather wrapped aluminum wheel is a thing of beauty and feels great in the hands, although it is a little small for my tastes, giving it more the feeling of a toy rather than a true racing sim wheel. Once I hooked everything up to my Playseat and got all my advance wheel settings configured in Forza 6, I noticed that the force feedback and vibration through the wheel felt pretty good, however, modulating brake and acceleration through the pedals was difficult as it is very hard to get a feel for the braking. If I was coming from a cheaper wheel/pedal set with no adjustability of the brake pedal I probably would be none the wiser, but I’m coming from a Fanatec CSR Wheel and CSR Elite pedals from Xbox 360, which was a great wheel and pedal set that allows the user to adjust the backpressure of the brake pedal using a spring adjustment behind the pedal. This Logitech G920 has no brake adjustment on the pedal itself, so you are left with the predetermined brake damper setting from the factory with no adjustment similar to cheaper wheels on the market, which is a shame because the pedals look really nice. It’s like Logitech created an awesome Xbox wheel, then threw some pedals in the box and called it a day. At this price point, they should have put a little more thought into the pedals. This Logitech is just not a four hundred dollar wheel/pedal set. At most, it should have been priced at two-fifty to three hundred dollars.

Again, I can’t recommend this Logitech wheel but I can recommend the Thrustmaster VG TX Racing Wheel Leather Edition wheel/pedal set, which costs for just a few dollars more than the (over-priced) Logitech. The Thrustmaster is a much better buy as it allows for fine brake adjustment using an included conical brake mod that screws in just behind the brake pedal. The Thrustmaster servo base itself is quite substantial and seems heavier than the combined Logitech G920 wheel and base it is attached to. The Thrustmaster leather racing wheel feels great and is slightly larger (and hence less toy-like) than the Logitech G920 wheel, and the Thrustmaster set even allows you to switch out the wheel and/or pedals with a number of alternative offerings from Thrustmaster if you so desire. For seventy dollars (at press time) more than the Logitech, you’re getting a whole heck of a lot more product with the Thrustmaster, and it seems to be a bit more substantial product that will last longer as well. Happy racing!","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_156?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=156&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When I first got wheel and set it up, I noticed the clips that attach to your table had a crack on it, and I didn't think much about it and I should have sent it back because I was drifting in forza 7 and the clip broke off when I was turning the wheel so now it can't stay on the table.

The wheel worked flawlessly when I got it, not a single problem.
But after about 3 days of use. I could hear a grind sound when I turned the wheel to the left, but not to the right. And it seemed to get a delay or possible short in Wires...

The last thing I have to complain about is the stick.
The way it was designed is horrible, you're not able to rest your hand on the shifter at all when shifting or it locks you out of gears.
For example if you put pressure on it pushing it down, it locks you in 1st and second only, 3rd and 4th, and 5th and 6th (reverse)
And after a couple of days the shifter wobbled in the gears a bunch.

I'm just ungodly disappointed in this product, I've always liked Logitech products, but this let me down big time.
Especially since I spent 300 of my hard earned dollars on this junk.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_132?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=132&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you’re hesitant, like I was, about buying this product, then don’t be. It’s a great wheel!

The only reasons I put 4 stars and not 5 are the pedals and the wires. Make sure you have something that can keep the pedals from sliding during use. And have a plan for wire management if you don’t want wires in your way.

Other than that, it’s 6 out of 5 stars for sure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Most realistic feel I've ever felt outside of an automobile. It takes a couple dedicated hours of playing with your setup to get it dialed in but once its there, WOW. It's not the same experience at all. Totally new kind of gaming experience and the most realistic feeling drive sim you can find for this price point. The feedback is amazing. Strong enough that you really feel like you're fighting a car but so precise and delicate that you can tell at the very point in which you start to lose grip. Minus the g-forces felt in your own body when driving, this is as close at it comes outside of super pricey sim setups. I'd HIGHLY recommend getting a seat/stand combo or something similar. Sitting otherwise, is pretty uncomfortable but still doable. Stop debating on getting a wheel and snag this baby. Whether you are someone who games casually and looking for a way to up your racing games, or someone who competes online in esports racing leagues, this wheel has something to offer. I'm upset at myself for debating on it for so long now that i see how much fun it is!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

As of this review I have used it only on the PS3, I may post an updated review once I have it set up on PS4 and PC.  The only thing I will say compared with other racing wheels is that I looked up the prices and this seem to be the best one in its price range (in other words you get a lot for your money).
The G29 force racing wheel from Logitech is overall a great buy if you are willing to pay as much as an actual console costs and like racing simulators and driving simulators.
Pros: The materials are of good quality and the wheel and pedals are very sturdy. The buttons are in a good layout and easy to press when holding the wheel from any normal steering wheel hand position. The G29 is very responsive to the various button presses and turns in-game. It gives a good amount of feedback and once setup, the vibration and feedback are easily adjustable. Cons: The G29 was very hard to set up on the PS3, it took a good hour before I got it working in-game. It also requires a different kind of setup for each game; some games don’t require any setup, others take a very specific set of steps to get it to work. It isn’t compatible with every game. Based on the controls and instructions it should be much easier to set up on the PS4, however at this moment, I still haven’t been able to set it up with PC. The vibration starts out set at too high a setting and if you don’t like a lot of feedback from the steering wheel, you may want a different one. It doesn’t come with a chair, you have to buy one separately for the same price as the wheel, but that is again, very inexpensive for what it is.
Overall, I think if you want a racing wheel that is fairly inexpensive, is solidly made, has good response and feedback, and you are willing to spend some time getting it set up, get the G29. But if you are willing to buy it, I suggest getting the racing seat accessory as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_151?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=151&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have tried some racing wheels in friends place and stores but none has been able give me an experience as immersive and satisfied as the G29.

My first impression of the G29 racing wheel is its hefty, quality construction. The leather wrapped steering wheel feels sturdy and comfortable. The feedback feels tactile and realistic. The button layout is neat and easily accessible. It features all the buttons on the DualShock 4 controller, minus the touchpad.

The floor pedals are superb. They are constructed of brushed metal and appear to be durable. They have realistic resistance and require a different amount of pressure to press down. Specifically, the brake pedal has a non-linear feel to it that resembles the brake of a real car. In fact, they all have a feel that is pretty close to real deal - the brake pedal feels like a real brake pedal, and the accelerator pedal feels like a real accelerator pedal.

I have hooked up the racing wheel to my PS4 and given the Project CARS and Driveclub a good spin. The overall experience is on a totally different level from that using a DualShock 4 controller. The force feedback is pretty realistic, on par with if not better than that on the older Logitech racing wheels that I had tried before. However, I didn't find the shift/RPM indicator lights on the wheel particularly useful since I would have been fixing my eyes on the screen anyway. The paddle shifters are just decent. They have a somewhat odd and plasticky feel to it. There is certainly room for improvement.

Unlike its predecessor G27, the G29 doesn't come with a stick shifter. which is now a separately sold accessory for $60. For a racing wheel costing as much as the PS4, you would think it would include a stick shifter like the G27 did. This is a real bummer. While the G29 is well made, it is not substantially better than the G27 in terms of bill of materials that they had to exclude the stick shifter in order to keep the cost down. I have been using the paddle shifters now and don't really miss the stick shifter. Still, it would have been a nice gesture for Logitech to include the stick shifter in the first place, as they did in the G27.

All in all, the G29 is a very nice racing wheel. It is well made and sturdy. It makes the overall racing experience so much more immersive and enjoyable to play. It is pricey but it adds a new level of realism that isn't comparable with that using a regular controller. The absence of the stick shifter is a disappointment (perhaps I may purchase it sometime down the road just to complete the experience). Anyway, the G29 is an excellent racing wheel that I am happy to have.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_149?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=149&reviewerType=all_reviews"

While these frustrations are understandable, they don't answer the question: What about this item?

There's a switch on the top of the wheel to, er, switch between PS3 and PS4. If you don't set this right, you'll notice funny things happening or not happening.

This is a nice looking and well-built set. The solid pedals feel like the real thing as far as comparing brake and gas pedal resistance and travel. The wheel is also well built, with a nice leather cover - nicer than my real car! However, the triangle button placement seems a little out of reach for quick access to reverse. Those of you who don't crash as much as I am doing will not mind, though.

As noted, there is no shifter included. This can be annoying as you have to shell out some more moolah for that, but you could use the steering wheel paddles in the meantime. The paddles are solid, but they are a bit rough around the edges, and could have used more rounding. Sometimes in the heat of the wheel jerking all over you may feel a bit of a bite - no blood, but not as comfortable as it could be. Possibly this mimics the real thing, and is not an issue for ""real"" drivers as they wear gloves, I don't know.

There are 13 mappable buttons on this thing. Wowza. Note that GT5 does not seem to provide a way to map these unless you try the G27 setttings, which are not quite the same.

The interior machinery on this thing is metal, which should make this a more durable wheel than others which use plastic, and the force is strong in this one. Yes, it can produce a LOT of torque. If attached to a small, lightweight table it will verily yank it around (in combination with the force you exert). Even attached to a normal desk you may find the friction screws loosening after a while. (Note that they include small attachments for thinner desks (preinstalled) which you may have to remove.) You can get a stand to remedy this, and I suppose you will if you're hard-core: Racing Steering Wheel Stand for Logitech G27/G25, G29 and G920 Wheels, Deluxe, Original Wheel Stand Pro Stand. Wheel and Pedals Not included.. Or a seat: Openwheeler Racing Wheel Stand Cockpit Blue/Black | For Logitech G29 | G920 and Logitech G27 | G25 | Thrustmaster Wheels | Racing wheel & controllers NOT included. These may work better.

You will have to attach a power cable and a couple of USB cables. Why isn't this wireless? I suppose it would end up costing more, with minor lag, although no lag is minor in racing games. So it's a tradeoff.

All in all, considering this set for all it's supposed to be, this is a great racing wheel. The couple of minor annoyances can be remedied with a separate shifter, which unfortunately is not included. It produces strong force when needed, should be durable, mostly feels good, and looks great besides.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_152?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=152&reviewerType=all_reviews"

As far as the electronics, time will only tell, but the force feedback wheel works very well. I don't notice any lag between myself and what the car does for Forza 6, which I primarily use it for.
The brakes are super stiff, and I would say I really have to smash them to fill the guage... not a fan of that, but I still need to tweak things.
The unit is spendy, and for that price Logitech should have included a headphone jack. Having to use another controller has caused me to drop my controller and ruin the USB port :( when I was spirialling out of control and was trying to correct for it LOL
It's adds a whole new level of realism, and fun to gaming.

It's also impossible to mount unless you have a desk designed with perfect dimensions, and the shifter that pairs with it always seems to break loose when you try to put it in reverse.

Originally I was going to play Assetto Corsa, but I have more recently gotten into the Dirt Rally games. Both are ""simulators"" rather than the more arcade-y feel of the likes of Forza or Gran Turismo. It is definitely compatible with all of the above.

Force feedback is a per-game thing for sure. Each game has their own settings you can configure and it can be difficult to get the same feel the way you want it in each game. It does work great for me. The wheel and shifter mounted well on to my table, although you have to refrain from pulling the wheel ""up"" since the back end of it will rise. Granted that's not something you should be doing anyway, but it can be a kind of beginner mistake when getting used to driving with a wheel.

The shifter when treated too roughly can come away from the table, even when latched on tightly. (Your mileage may vary). I recommend that you lightly ""flick"" from gear to gear as opposed to wrenching it around like you would on a real gear shifter. The paddle shifters also work as advertised although I prefer the actual shifter.

Overall I would recommend this wheel to anyone getting into sim racing and doesn't want to shell out a lot for the most premium wheel offerings out there. Don't let ""entry-level"" scare you away, this is a high-quality racing wheel and it does the job very well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I already have a Logitech g27 with the shifter that cost quite a bit less than this wheel without the shifter. I realize this isn't a review about the price though, so I'll move on and talk about the wheel.

First, the setup for the wheel really could not have been easier on my Xbox One or my PC. I hooked it up to my Xbox first. I plugged it in and it worked. I didn't have to do anything else for the xbox to recognize it. I launched Forza 6, set the steering option to ""Simulation"" and I was good to go! I ended up tweaking the deadzones in forza a bit more to my liking, but that was just software settings, and small ones at that.

For my PC, I downloaded and installed the latest Logitech gaming software before I plugged the USB cable into the PC. Once it was installed, I plugged in the USB cable, the wheel spun around a bit and it was ready to go. I launched Assetto Cora and to my surprise, found a premade config for the Logitech g920 with and without the shifter. I selected the one without the shifter, went into the controller setup wizard, and all controls responded perfectly. I don't know if I had to go into the controller setup wizard, but I did just in case. After that, I launched a race (in manual shifting mode) and ran a few laps around Mugello just to see how it was. There were no issues at all. Everything worked just as you would expect.

For anyone that has ever owned a Logitech g27, you will instantly be familiar with this wheel. It feels very much the same, but with the extra buttons for the xbox control. The wheel is the same size, though it now has a flat bottom The leather feels great, just like it did on the g27.  Even the wheel base is identical to the g27. This is a good thing because that was rock solid on everything I clamped it to. A noticeable difference from the g27 is that the wheel no longer has the LED shift indicator lights. I understand that xbox games may not support this, but it would be nice to still be able to use them for PC games.

The wheel itself is very quiet. I can't imagine anyone having any complaints about the noise from this. One minor thing I don't like about the wheel is the LED light just above the xbox button. It's REALLY bright. I ended up putting some black electrical tape over it and you can still see the light through the tape!

The pedals look exactly the same as the g27 but with black pistons instead of red. One thing about he pedals though, as you can see in almost every review out there, is that the brake pedal is amazingly stiff. So stiff that I had to put the back of my chair up against my couch to keep from pushing myself backwards just to get the car to slow down at all. I've never driven an F1 race car, but I have never had to press any brake pedal as hard as this one to get 100% travel. It was ridiculously stiff. This is all because of a small piece of rubber that is inserted into the break pedal spring to give it ""progressive"" pressure. In reality, it ended up being almost no pressure to start with, then a massive amount of pressure from about 20% all the way to 100%. It was not gradual at all. You could clearly tell when the pedal hit the rubber. Real break pedals don't work like that. After 2 hours of racing, my foot hurt and all I could think about during the race is preparing myself to brake HARD on the next corner.

It is a simple fix though (see my photos). *Doing this will void your warranty.* It took me about 20 minutes to take the base apart, take the piece of rubber out of the spring, and put it all back together. This made an amazing difference. All three pedals now feel exactly like the pedals on the g27. The brake pedal is still more stiff than the accelerator or clutch, but not so stiff that it's almost useless. After a few laps, I had stopped thinking about braking and just started thinking about racing again.

To the credit of the pedal base though, it stuck to my carpet like crazy. I easily pushed my chair backwards but the base never slid a bit. It stuck to my carpet like crazy.

This could have been a 5 star rating if I didn't have to mod it to get the brake pedal to work normally and if it had the shifter included. You can use the g27 shifter with this wheel, but I plan on selling my g27 and I can't really sell it without the shifter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I use this product in conjunction with Project CARS for Xbox One, and Forza Motorsport 6 for Xbox One. Both games give an incredible amount of feedback to the driver as to what the car is doing. I've driven many cars in my day (albeit none of them have been race machines by any means), and this wheel accurately provides torque steer, sensations of understeer and oversteer, and the sensation of a car getting squirrely under hard braking. There is a minimal deadzone at top-dead-center of the wheel, and just about any function of the wheel you do not like you can change within the advanced settings of a game. The pedals feel great. At first, I hated the brake pedal, as it has a conical piece of rubber within the spring to give it non-linear travel, but after adjusting the inside/outside deadzone for the brake to 1/55, it feels great, and no longer requires sliding my chair back to stop a car. That brings up another +1 for this wheel; the pedals have a little claw on the front that grips carpet -- I couldn't get them to budge under hard braking.

The wheel can not provide anything without the direction from a game, so I cannot review the wheel with anything other than PCARS and FM6. I would assume that on a game like Need For Speed, Forza Horizons (1&2), or any other arcade-style game, it would feel cheesy and unrealistic, as those games are cheesy and unrealistic. BE WARNED: It took me (a fairly tech-savvy guy) about 3 hours to set up, calibrate, and dial in the wheel and pedals and their respective deadzones and other settings with Project CARS. It is a very immersive game. You can adjust every parameter of the wheels performance with the game, and to be honest you have to before it's any fun: It is most definitely NOT plug 'n' play. Now that I have it dialed in, though, it is much more fun than Forza. On Forza however, it is simple. You start up the game plug in the wheel, and voila, you're ready to rock. It works incredibly well. The only parameter I adjusted was the brake (as I stated above), and the ""rumble"", which felt a little too violent for my glass table. This is the game I would start the wheel with, just because it is so easy to set up. Get yourself hooked on the idea of a wheel before you commit to screwing with Project CARS.

All in all, it's a great buy. Quality construction, good table clamps, easy to use, fun, quiet, and it's made by Logitech so I'm sure if anything goes wonky with it, it would be a simple phone call to get help/parts/replacements/etc. I could've been happy with a little more diameter of the wheel, and I think that for the money they could've included the shifter, but hey, if you were running the business you'd do the same thing.

Buy it.

Tell your wife and kids you're sorry, but you can't see them for a week.

Play this for a week.

Be happy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_150?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=150&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Good Force Feedback. It's more than strong enough. I would rate 5 stars, but my G920 was defective as it does not recognize the shifter. I see many people complaining about the brake pedal. I love the feeling of the progressive pedal, and it's true that you can't reach full braking force with your game settings at default; however, if you adjust the Deceleration Deadzone in Forza or any PC racer with customization controls, it makes for rather realistic feeling brake.

About 6 months prior, I had decided to make sim racing into a hobby and buy a wheel again.  Dirt: Rally was kind of what prompted it, but iRacing is life now.  When I started shopping for wheels I had my eyes on a G27, but winter is kind of slow in my line of work, so I planned to buy one the following spring.  That winter, to my great chagrin, the G27 was discontinued following the release of the G29, and prices doubled.  So I decided to get a G29, and jumped on a $100 off sale that spring.  I almost wish I would have gotten the G920 for PS4 compatibility rather than XONE, but I still haven't bothered with either of those consoles so that shows how much that matters to me.

IMPRESSIONS:  On first impressions, the package as a whole looks and feels nice.  The leather and brushed aluminum look great.  Very similar to a G27, just a little more sleek and modern looking.  Mechanically, it at least feels like it was made with better materials than my old Microsoft FFB wheel.  I've never used a Fanatec wheel, so I can't compare the G29 to the best, but I have no complaints about my G29.  The FFB, pedals, and shifter all feel well-made, with the shifter being perhaps the weakest link.  The knob and leather boot are a nice touch, but the shift gates feel somewhat cheap and plastic.  Glad I paid $100 less to soften the blow of buying the shifter separately.

FUNCTIONALITY/SETUP: Setup is fairly easy.  It has clamps underneath to secure to a desk or table, and holes for mounting screws.  I made a custom ramp box to mount my pedals at an angle and secure them.  Eventually I will buy or build a rig to mount everything to, but for now I have a board behind the pedal box to hold it in place.  If you're on carpet, the pedals have a spike strip you can deploy, but I wouldn't trust it with adult legs.  If I make sure to screw the clamps down tightly, I don't have issues with the wheel or shifter coming loose, though it did happen a few times early on, which can be disastrous (not to mention hilarious as you maneuver to a safe spot with the wheel in your lap).

BOTTOM LINE:  This is a good enough wheel for the price.  You might be able to get a decent Thrustmaster for less, but I have no experience with those.  I went with the G29 because it was the successor to the G27, and the G27 seemed to be the most popular wheel of its generation.  As an entry-level sim racer, I think this was the perfect wheel for me to buy.  Some day I will spring for a Fanatec kit and buttkickers, etc. but I am very happy with this one for now.  I have been using it damn near every day for a little over a year now, and it shows no signs of wear.  If I wipe everything down it still looks and works like it's brand new.  -1 star because it's almost twice the price of a G27, with more features removed than added.  C'est la vie, it's probably still the best wheel under $500.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_40?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=40&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I can't say they were ever my favorite genre, but I enjoy them.  I played Forza 4 on the 360 with an economy wheel and had a splendid time of it.

Playing Forza 6 with this was an entirely different experience.  My hands were shaking; my heart was pounding.  It has been a long time since a game did that to me.  The wheel fights like a real wheel.  You go into a skid and you need to struggle that wheel to go where you want.  It's not so much strength as skills, and it's amazing.  If you release the wheel slightly, like you might in a real car after a turn, it rights itself exactly as a real car will.  It turns pretty much as much as a real car's wheel will in any direction.

You can, of course, attach it to a table or something like -- it connects with a small clamp tightened by two knobs on top that look like buttons (twist them if you're having trouble and the clamps with slowly descend or ascend)  but if you're going to go with a wheel of this quality, you may want to go all the way with a wheel stand.  It makes a difference in comfort and stability.  On the folding table I tried the table tipped, the whole thing shifted around, and it was bad.  With even an entry level stand, so long as it has a board to clamp this too, it is perfect.

If you want the most intense racing experience possible, you want this wheel.  There are cheaper out there, but the quality difference is severe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_153?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=153&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Roller","May Be Ok For Kids I Guess....","December 13, 2018","I wasn't sure what to expect when I started looking into steering wheels, pedals and gearshifters for my computer.  I figured surely they were just about the same as the real life thing.  Boy was I wrong.  The steering wheel is smaller, makes it uncomfortable for adults to use.  The pedals are too close together, also makes it very awkward and not user friendly at all, if you're an adult.  Not to mention, I used the first time and then after that I couldn't get to work again.  I'm sure it was something minor that I needed to do on my part, because it came on, it just wasn't detecting it in game, and or initializing correctly.  Anyways, this was not anything what I expected so I ended up sending it back.  I typically really like Logitech peripherals,  but this is unacceptable.  I use a Logitech G Pro keyboard and mouse, and they are great!  Have used Logitech components for several years, heck I'd say probably 15 years or more, and never have had an issue with them, however I'm sad to say the Logitech G29 Racing Wheel needs some serious work done to satisfy the average gamer.  Make your steering wheel actual size for one, I'm not sure why you wouldn't.  Also the pedals, make them about what they would be in a race car or even a regular vehicle geez, why put them so close together that it feels awkward and have trouble hitting one or the other, and they're not big enough either.  Anywho.  I hope they make a better version of this in the future.  For now, the only option is something like this or spend thousands of dollars for a real simulation setup.  If you have kids, and you're looking for a steering wheel combo, this may do.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

A quick read of the simple instructions and five minutes later I was racing.  Had some in-game set up to do,  (the game I'm referring to is Gran Turismo Sport) sencativty and how much torque to apply.

but with this being my first SIM racing wheel I had no trouble setting it up to my liking.  The wheel itself feels very comfortable in my long skinny hands, it's very responsive to the slightest bump in-game, and I can be very precise and smooth with the in-game vehicles.  The pedals are very sturdy and feel like a real car, although the brake pedal is pretty stiff it's accurate, sensitive and is very manageable.

I also bought a chair/ mounting platform to use in combination with this setup.  The wheel and pedals feel very sold and able to take aggressive sharp inputs.  But I don't feel the it is needed as you can easily attach it to any object that the mounting arms fit around (a table or desk)

There's a rubber block inserted in the brake pedal that you have to remove in order for the brakes to function properly. You have to remove the screws attaching the assembly plates together and the spring piston linkage in the brake pedal assembly. It's a bit tricky to remove, but once you remove the rubber block from the brake assembly and put back the pedals assembly together again, the wheel's even better. I like this wheel and I just wish that Logitech didn't put in the rubber block in the brake pedal. Driving with a wheel beats using a controller.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_119?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=119&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've only owned this and one other Logitech wheel: The original, full quality, red case Momo force. I miss that wheel, but this is a great replacement. Unfortunately, I've never used the competition, but I highly recommend this wheel. Also, if you like stick shift in real life, just get the shifter. I've been heel-toe-ing all over the place, it's awesome!

Be sure to plant the pedals firmly, the platform easily shifts as you alternate clutch and throttle. If you 'stand' on the brake, it helps dig in to your carpet to prevent movement. Overall, the metal pedals feel very nice. As others have mentioned, the brake is a bit stiff to start. Mine softened up nicely after about a week.

Look out! The wheel turns lock to lock every time you plug in the usb, open Logitech software, or start the computer. I forgot about a cable laying between the spokes when starting the pc. The wheel/cable turned my cluttered desk into a Rube Goldberg machine, ending in a spilled beer. My fault, easy to do, you've been warned.

It's a bit small. My Momo wheel was actually full size and felt like it came out of a real car. Keep in mind, that wheel was much more expensive several years ago. This one is still pretty great, especially with all the added controls.

The 'leather' feels good, but has already developed a small cut. It feels very thin. Nicely stitched, tho.

The wheel turns almost 3x lock to lock. Compared with the old wheel, this is much more realistic in street cars.

You really can't go wrong with this. Have fun!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_147?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=147&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It works well, that's the bottom line. However, I think it could have a better pedal feel and it should be more adjustable that way. The pedals do not mimic a real car in that there isn't quite the feel of a hydraulic clutch or brake system. The throttle is ok however as most fly-by-wire cars today have a pedal that isn't really connected to anything either. The steering, being force feedback does work well and gives a genuine feel of being behind the wheel so to speak. It would neat if someday they could add forcefeeback pedals to give you the real experience of trying to clutch and brake an angry big block 60's muscle car, but for now they just feel kind of dead. Lastly, the mounting options are secure and I never had a problem with the components coming lose, so in all, not a bad buy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_81?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=81&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've only ever had one other racing wheel and that was the cheap xbox 360 first party wheel to compare with the G29 too but the G29 is league's better. Seems pretty well built and the pedals are really nice (the 3 pedal version). I've read a lot of reviews about how stiff the brake pedal was and how many people actually to it apart and modified by taking out some rubber peice that would make it easier to depress. I'm not really sure why though? The brake pedal felt just right for me. I do have it bolted on a racing stand so it's not going anywhere but if it was on the ground instead I'm not really sure if it'd slide around or not but I think it'd probably be fine. On a side not, you'll probably want to adjust some settings with what ever game your playing because out of the box I think all the setting were set to maximum on Gran Turismo Sport and it almost made me not like the wheel at first. I turned the FFB down to like 3-4, and the other setting down some too (can't remember the name of the setting), and turned control sensitivity up to 100% and the wheel feels amazing!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I purchased it to feel more immersed into the game play instead of using the game pad.  After receiving the unit(s) and installed on a driving wheel stand, I installed it on my PC.  Windows 10 picked up the device with no problem.  I calibrated the wheel, pedals and shifter using the Windows 10 gaming utility.

After configuration, Forza 4 picked up the wheel, shifter and pedals.  However, the PC version of the game didn't recognize the button types as Xbox buttons.  It displayed the numerical values instead.  Not sure why, but all peripheral component buttons worked.  I had to memorize what button did what game function but I used the keyboard also for specific functions within the game.  When I attach the wheel/pedal and shifter to the Xbox One, all of the buttons work and display as designed.

One of the Need for Speed games on EA did not work at all with the Logitech Wheel.  No controls worked at all, to include the pedals, the brake pedal was reverse, the clutch was gas, etc.  Basically unplayable.  That is why I rated the Versatility a 2.  Website searches showed that others had the same problem I was having with the game.

For the price paid for the wheel/pedals and shifter I would figure would work with all driving sims games but doesn't.  I enjoy the immersion of game play (ones that work) with the wheel and hope that other new driving sims will support these peripheral devices.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It was actually louder than the game itself with the sound nearly maxed.  After seeing so many positives I just assumed I had a bad wheel, I sent it back and received another one.

Right out of the box, loud squeaking sounds when you turn left, I googled the issue, and found pages upon pages on reddit, Logitech's forum, and youtube, talking about this exact issue.  Logitech Customer support is absolutely useless.  They have never acknowledged the problem, they haven't answered anyone's questions in the forum.  They refuse to do anything about it.  I filled out my support form to them, gave them the model and serial number and everything they needed to know, my only question to them was can this issue be fixed without taking it apart and voiding the warranty.

2 days later i got reply that said they need the model number, serial number, when I purchased.  Info I just gave them, I sent this 2nd one back, hoping to get one that worked.  Amazon was awesome with the returns, and I hate to have done this 3 times, but i really wanted this wheel to work.  The 3rd and final wheel came, I got one last email from Logitech that asked the exact same questions as before, and wanted me to scan my receipt for proof of purchase to see if it's still in warranty.
I just wanted to know if there was a fix, that was all, I sent them the receipt from Amazon, and never heard from them since.  This 3rd wheel, right out of the box not only had a squeaking sound, but it was making loud clicking noises as if the gears inside were rubbing up against each other, at this price point I don't want to end up sending a brand new wheel for them to work on and more than likely get a refurbished one back that will more than likely have the same issue.

If you can get a wheel without the squeaking and clicking and noises it makes, then you have the best gaming wheel I think you can buy.  and maybe the squeaking may not be a bad issue, you just have to live with it.  I don't know, but I don't want to pay that much to hear that all day.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

AWFUL game support.","September 10, 2017","Horrific support and it's a pain trying to set this up without support. Independent tools aren't really existent so you have to rely on the poor software integration and logitech's poor drivers.

In some games this worked amazingly well and auto realigned. The old Need For Speed: Most Wanted game worked great with this, surprisingly.

Every other game? Nope. Half baked support and features. You'll need to do some SERIOUS tweaking if you want your game to use this wheel in its full capacity.

And it's not worth it. The quality is average to subpar considering the price. It uses gears which create great resistance feedback but make the wheel feel awful. Very grindy and rough feeling and sounding.

Build quality is poor since the clamps release. Considering this wheel is supposed to be used with force and give back force, the clamp system is laughably stupid and bad. It's entirely pointless unless you're going to Drive Miss Daisy around.

If this were 100 bucks cheaper it would be ok. As it stands, take the criticisms this wheel gets seriously. It truly is awful and because of the broken clamp system I had to return this.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_139?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=139&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I’ll start with the only reason this wheel is not worth buying.
CON:
it doesn’t have Vibration feedback,only force feed back .
MEANING: when you depend on the feel of the vibration telling you the tires are about to lose traction or steering is about lo lock ...that is not included in this wheel.

PROS: Built to last.
  Easy mount.
  Amazing beautiful wheel feels solid and the leather finish awesome.

Notes:
 the brake pedal mod is fixable with easy effort.
Logitec software Rocks.

If you want to buy this to use on an Xbox One then it may be a good choice and even on PC if you can be lucky enough to get it to work.

I was so surprised by how responsive and how well this thing actually works. There’s a pretty big learning curve and takes a while to get the hang of and get used too but once you do you will have SO much fun. Be patient because it’s a little tough at first but once I really learned how to race and drift with this setup I can’t pull myself away from the game. (Forza Horizon 3) You really have to grip the steering wheel when you’re driving because it moves, jerks and feels real when you hit bumps and hills and stuff. All in all this racing setup is a lot of fun and I highly recommend it. I would also recommend investing in the racing stand (in picture) because you can really bolt everything down and have a nice solid setup. Ever since I was a little kid I dreamed of having this exact racing setup in my house so needless to say I love it and I have a lot of fun with it.

I bought this on sale to replace my first wheel, a Thrustmaster T80. I was wearing out T80s after about 2 months. Fortunately the manufacturer stood behind them enough to send me new ones. I've had the Logitech G20 for over 6 months now and have had zero issues. I use this with a PS4, and my game of choice is GT Sport.

As for the force-feedback part of it, it is fun being able to feel the curbstones in the corners. It is even more fun when you feel, in the wheel, when the car gets light after cresting a hill. The pedals are much nicer than T80 set in that I get just a little ""feedback"" (not force-feedback) from the rubber bumper under the pedal. Some folks take the bumper out, but I left it in and rely on it. I can always press into it if needed.

If you are thinking about getting your first wheel, I think the G29 is great. The T80 may be half of the price of the G29, but it is not even a quarter of the quality and durability of the G29. That said, just having a wheel and pedals alone makes a big difference in game-realism over using the joystick controllers (and for me makes a difference in overall time). I was quite content with the T80 until it started failing, but I was also already wondering if force-feedback was worth the extra money (it is).

One star off only because the force-feedback, while very nice, feels a little gritty. I'm guessing the more $$ we spend, the more realistic and smooth they feel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This is the first ever wheel I've bought, so initial setup took some learning, but was straightforward enough.

Getting it to work properly with some games can be exceedingly frustrating, but it's hard to differentiate whether it's the game itself being the difficulty or the wheel.

After buying the G29 and doing a bit more tech support googling and the like, I'd probably purchase the Thrustmaster T300 if given the choice again. Although I've been decently happy with the product, it's design does seem to be compromised where the T300 is a much more focused, quality product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After trying to decide between this and Thrustmasters option I ending up going with Logitech based on great past experiences with their products (not to say Thrustmaster is bad I bought one of their joysticks for my dad for flight sims and he really like it). The quality is really great for this wheel, and I especially like the medal paddle shifters and pedals.The force feedback is taking some getting use to, but this is my first wheel (I usually play racing games with a controller). Mainly using this to play Project Cars 2 and Forza. I'm no expert but it works well for me, I'm really just trying to get over the learning curve of moving from a controller to an actual wheel. I did not pick up the shifter for right now. I think in the future I may end up getting a actual seat and what not since just playing in my office chair is not super comfortable based on sitting position.

Now this is beating a dead horse at this point, but I really cannot stand the break pedal, and that's because I have to literally stand on it to make it work. Seriously who at Logitech thought making it that stiff was a good idea. The break pedal in my own car isn't even that hard to depress. At the very least they should've made it adjustable. I may inevitably do the brake pedal mod but I'm torn because I don't really want to void the warranty. Seriously a big mistake on Logitech's part for doing that.

I had to take it apart and apply an electrically safe lubricant to one of the brushed motors that drives the force feedback. It's been working beautifully since then.

Other minor complaints: the pedal unit is a little too light to stay planted on carpet, even with the spikes deployed. The pedals are also pretty darn close together. You're not likely to hit the wrong pedal or anything, but you will find your shoes attacking one another during left foot braking.

A lot of reviews mention the noise, which I won't deny. It did squeak quite a bit out of the box, but the squeaking died down with use. Be aware that this wheel gets hot with use, and will quickly heat a small room up. It's good for the longevity of the wheel to allow it to cool down after a half hour or so of use (same goes for your eyes). It's addicting and brutalizing at the same time: it really changes the racing experience. For the price, this is easily the single best entry level force-feedback wheel you can buy.

The one major issue with it is that not all racing or driving games will work with it. Mainly all of the PC racing games will work, so long as they're mainstream. Off the beaten path games may not have controller support. Be sure to check and see which games support it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Project Cars picks up this wheel right from the settings and even shows you a layout of the g920 right in the game to easily change buttons. Being I am a pc gamer as well is the reason I chose this one. I have previous Logitech projects so I plugged in the wheel and it instantly showed up in the list of active Logitech prouducts.

The first time you put your hands on the wheel you can feel how well made this thing is and it might be a little bit difficult or even frustrating at first but after a few hours of playing and messing with the wheel settings for each game you will have a lot of fun and realism.
There are some comments about the brake pedal being too stiff and too hard to push it all the way down and there are even some tutorials on YouTube on how to remove the little rubber piece from that pedal but I wouldn’t recommend this because it will take away the “real” feeling of braking a true racing car and also could avoid guarantee or something. Instead what I would recommend is to adjust the brake pedal settings on each game for example on forza horizon 3 you can go ahead and decrease the deacceleration  outside setting all the way down to 20-25 and will be just perfect and you won’t take the risk of breaking your pedals trying to remove the rubber and also you will keep the realistic feeling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This model is suppose to be an 'upgrade' to the G27, but I'm not too sure about that. First, despite costing nearly twice the price of the G27, the new G920 (and G29 for the Playstation 4) does not include the manual shifter. That's a huge disappointment for me since I love using the 'old style' shifting option. Logitech does offer the shifter as an add-on, but you have to cough up an extra $60.

Although the new design feels very familiar, the controls are vastly different. The G27 had three buttons on each side of the wheel that you can easily access with your thumb without interrupting steering, plus another eight buttons and control pad mounted on the shifter. The G920 basically has an Xbox controller mounted to the middle of the steering wheel. Although it'll probably be helpful for those who aren't familiar with the wheel, I personally don't like it, and much prefer the old-style thumb buttons over having an entire controller in your face. With the G920, I find that I have to move my hand to reach buttons, where the G27's buttons could easily be reached, even while turning, without moving my hands.

Aside from the buttons, I found no difference in steering control between the two models. Both wheels feel great and the force-feedback is fantastic, but I found no improvement whatsoever with the new wheel. The peddles also are pretty much the same, although the brake peddle seems a bit stiffer and more realistic compared to the G27.

On its own, the steering wheel is a fantastic addition to any game system... it's incredibly well built, feels like a quality piece of equipment, and offers an amazing experience for driving games. The wheel mounts easily and securely to my desk, and removes just as easily. Compared to the G27, it offers Xbox compatibility, but outside that, for me, there's really no reason to upgrade. I'm glad I have a good racing wheel controller for my Xbox, but for PC use, I prefer the G27... not to mention, it's half the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_151?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=151&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It has been 100% trouble free, and mounted great on the wheel stand pro I bought to go with it.  If you are going to try rally, you will definitely want the shifter.

The G29 was recommended to me by a friend. I wish I'd spent a little more and gotten something better. There are a few degrees of dead zone in the middle of this wheel, when you are in that dead zone, you get zero feedback from the car. The clutch pedal doesn't work either. While this is probably fine for ""games"", it's not very good for a simulator like iRacing.

Googled a few sites on the best configuration for the two games and set the wheel up accordingly.

The steering feel is very good and sometimes I forget I'm playing a simulator .  It is a complete blast to slide and counter-steer in Wreckfest.  The only downside as others have mentioned is the pedal set does slip around on the carpet.  Will need to attach to a rubber mat or something to keep it from sliding.  Otherwise, the pedal set is great, the gas and brake work well and the feel is realistic with the brakes giving good resistance.  I didn't purchase a stock shift and don't feel the need for it as the paddle shifters are huge and work great.

I saw the reviews for Thrustmaster before making this purchase decision, but there seemed to be durability/longevity issues with it, so I chose the Logitech instead.  Hope the Logitech lasts.  I am very happy with this purchase!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to remove the plastic addition to the clamp for use with a bigger desk. The wheel look like leather but feels like paper (not a problem for me).
The paddle shifters on the back feel great and have a nice click.
Brake pedal needs some modding but otherwise I'm currently using the clutch for it.
Force Feedback feels great.

As for the games I play with it (ETS, ATS and FS), it greatly improved my turning and acceleration to emit more realization.

The XBox LED is bright, but not bright enough to cause me to block it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_107?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=107&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The pedals have nice feedback as does the wheel.  The games you play will make a difference on how well this setup works.  For example, this works perfectly with gran turismo.  My 10yr old son and I never really cared for the kart racing in the game before.  Now with this new wheel, we both love the karts.  It's almost as much fun as going to the go cart track in real life.  We tried it with Project Cars and it does work. However, it's very touchy and it makes it difficult to race.  Maybe I just need to get used to it.  I still love the quality of this wheel and I'm now tempted to get the gear shift, (even though you do have paddle shifters on this wheel).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_58?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=58&reviewerType=all_reviews"

OK...","February 28, 2017","I honestly don't think i received a product worth the money I paid for... It is lacking in so many details... I'll list them off...
- The ""Leather"" feels more like paper.
- The LB and RB triggers behind the wheel feel like they just came out of the metal cutter. The edges are a little sharp.
- The buttons are sometimes not very responsive, requiring multiple presses at times.
- The LSB and RSB buttons feel flimsy and cheap. They can break any second.
- The force feedback isn't too great. You can feel the grind of the belt as you turn.
- The break pedal is WAY too stiff! It requires a bit of leg muscle to work it. In tense situations of slamming the break, the foot pedal controller would actually tilt and flip backwards!!!
- The clamps need rubberized feet. The wheel has slipped twice on me now.
- That one LED is rather too bright.
- Needs its own power source... yet another outlet needed...

All in all, im pleased it was discounted by over a $100, this wheel is hardly worth $300. But it functions for the most part, and works well with Euro Truck Simulator 2. It just doesn't feel high quality at all. I'd recommend looking for a better wheel if you can afford it. If not, then this wouldn't be the worst option. I just hope it can last me at least 5 years...","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_68?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=68&reviewerType=all_reviews"

And in the 4 months (more or less) of owning it, my overall experience with it is ok, although there were many considerable negative experiences I've had.

Pros:
-Nice textured feeling on the wheel
-A stand under the pedals to help prevent unwanted movement
-Compatible for PCs and PS4s
-Confgurable buttons

Cons:
-Wheel starts squeaking everytime I turn it (After 1 month of usage)
-Plastic peeled off on 2 of the 3 pedals (after 2 months usage; had to apply tape to prevent further breakage)
-Blue stripe starts peeling off (after 3 months usage)
-Playstation logo popped off (was only held on by tape, so I reattached it)
-Dust magnet
-Clunky software support on PC
-Expensive compared to other competitors
-L2,L3,R2, and R3 buttons feel fragile

In short, durability, software, and price is what you might need to consider if you want to purchase the G29.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It definitely does NOT simulate a real wheel, but for purposes of a racing sim it is realistic enough. It is well made, and feels like a sturdy unit. I sometimes get aggressive with it when playing, and it is holding up very well. Just note that you definitely need to mount it to something sturdy, or you can easily pull it off.

The pedals are also well made, but the base feels like a cheap plastic. It will not stay in place on hardwood floors, so you will need to come up with a way to hold it in place if you aren't putting it in a cockpit. The pedals themselves feel realistic and have a nice metal finish with rubber pads to keep your feet in place. The cables are long enough to reach to the steering wheel, and the power cable was long enough for my needs. The USB cable was not long enough, and I had to get an extender, but to be fair it is across the room from my computer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_83?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=83&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Worked great right out of the box. I was worried about the 'gear noise' & 'deadzone' other people have complained about but those two factors are very minimal. When racing and with a headset you won't notice them at all.
After hard mounting this setup is like a tank. No wobble or play at all in the wheel base or rim as well as the pedals.
I found new rubber mod in the brake pedal useless- the force required to go full braking with the mod was high enough to cause flex in my rig seat, and did not feel more realistic.
Only reason I can't give it five stars - the g-shifter isn't included like it was with the g25/g27.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I got this specifically to use with Project Cars and Truck simulator, but neither software recognizes the steering wheel as being installed.  After Googling, it becomes obvious that tons of people have this problem.  There may or may not be a bunch of extra steps you need to go through to get the thing working.  I have to assume most of the positive reviews are for people using controllers like the xBox.  Although I have no evidence this works any better on xBox, but I can attest, that if you have a PC, this controller does not work properly.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Good for Xbox One only.","February 7, 2016","Works great on XBOX One, but not on PC.  On PC there is no mapping software to map the pedals.  Common problem once you start looking around the sim forums to troubleshoot.  My throttle pedal does throttle at one end and brakes at the other.  The brake and clutch pedals do not work.  There is no easy way to remap the pedals in the Logitech software or within games, without loading external mapping software.  So basically, to use this wheel on PC, everything needs to be mapped through a secondary software hack to make it work.  A racing wheel should have proper pedal mapping from Logitech.

I would not buy this wheel again.

You have to screw the wheel onto the assembly but after awhile the grooves start to wear and tear and you start to lose control of your car when driving, then the control stops completely and after that the pedal set stops working not to mention the pedal resistance being very average.

My Thrustmaster 300rs died after only 3 months of use and I went back to Logitech and got the G29 (didn't even know Logitech made the G29 until I saw the update for project cars), I've been having a blast with the G29 and haven't had any problems whatsoever and the pedal resistance is awesome and the force feedback feels very natural and coincides with every turn and bump you encounter on the race track.  The G29 is well worth the money spent and your driving performance will definitely improve 100% switching from a controller to a racing wheel, i recommend this wheel to racing game fans because the quality of this product is 2nd to none and no one else comes close to Logitech when you talk about racing wheels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_57?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=57&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The wheel was very easy to setup (plug and play).  The reason I give it only three stars is it only works with basically two games, the Forza games and Project Cars.  Thats right, basically two games for a $400 wheel and pedals without the shifter.

Here are the games it DOESN'T SUPPORT  Need for Speed, WRC, The Crew, F1 2015, Rock N Racing, Need for Speed Rivals and no new game support is even mentioned on the Logitech website.

I now basically have a $400 racing wheel to play with two games now and for the future.  If you want a really nice wheel with force feedback to play only with the Forza franchise this is it.  But if you want to be able to use with other racing games you are S*** out of luck.

While I haven't used any other brands, this being my first, I can't compare it to anything else.  Using it in games like F1 2016, Dirt Rally and Project cars, creates for a very solid experience with plenty of feedback.

For each game I generally have to tweak the brake pedal to reach full braking power a little earlier as it is hard to fully depress the pedal.  It feels nice though, but games generally seem to expect you be able to fully depress the pedal to get 100% brake and that's pretty difficult to do.

I bought the 920 a year ago to use for iRacing, and had it for almost a year when it had some glitch with it that was registering buttons. It was used and beat a lot, and even fell off my desk a few times, so not really any fault on Logitech. At my time of purchasing this, it was the same price as the 920 but usually its a bit more expensive, and here's why. The G29 has Playstaion buttons instead of Xbox, which isn't fantastic but also not a huge deal if you want to play games on PC, as most show Xbox controls in game. However it also has pretty solid LED shift lights above the center of it, which is a nice touch. In addition however, it also has 5 more usfull buttons, and a knob type button as well. Also located well to be able to be pressed while driving. It also has the LED light signifying that it's on at the top of the wheel, instead of on the face of it which blinds you if it's dark in your room which is what the G920 has, so that's nice. Overall in my opinion the blue center tape and buttons look cooler than the silver/white ones on the G920. It is compadable for PC, PS3, and a PS4 though i have only used it on PC as the only PS i have is a PS2. I have used it for iRacing, NASCAR Heat 2, NASCAR Heat 3, rFactor2, Project Cars, American Truck Simulator, NR2003, F1 2015, F1 2017, and Gravel and it works perfectly on all of them.

The wheel is okay....After trying it, I can say that the wheel is not worth it at this price point. I might buy it again if it cost about 100$...and included the stick.

 Didn't have an issue with the brake pedal being super stiff, you can just have the software adjust the percentage of the pedal that you use. So instead of 100% of the depression distance, only use 50%. You can do the same for the accelerator if you desire. The wheel itself feels pretty good and has a fair amount of buttons if you want to play any Need For Speed games that use extra buttons for deployables.

 On the other hand, the software (for windows 7) is terrible. At random times during gameplay, the wheel would suddenly (without hitting anything in game) pull to the left or I would have to setup the software again. You also are not able to assign a key press to the pedals (unless the game already has a profile setup for that), so if you want to assign 'w' to the accelerator, good luck.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_114?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=114&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Once you fully configure it, you will have the most tailored driving experience.
I added the shifter with it and it is terrific.
Force Feedback: pretty brutal at the beginning, once you are use to it and you smoother your driving style you will feel every single movement of the car.
On the wheel controls: just a Xbox one controller so well placed and easy to use.
Shifting paddles: nice to catch on straight lines you will be challenged during corners.
Pedals: gas great, clutch easy, brake a little bit hard but I like it.
USB cable: I would enjoy 1 or 2 extra feet...","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It feels good, my first racing wheel. I honestly wasn't that good by for Euro truck simulator 2, it worked fine. Until the driver crashed and the forcefeed back locked the wheel to the center. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling everything, restarting my computer, hard reset the wheel, take the pedal off, turning the FFB on and off, playing with the calibration which did absolutely nothing other than show that if I threw my back into it, I could still turn the wheel through it all.

The pedals, the brake was stiff as hell like everyones saying, that's all true. It's a pain to even brake, I just turned it down to half and it got around to it.

I paid three hundred dollars for this, I am not dealing with any of the garbage for that much money. It's software too, unplugged, it works fine. Turns fine. It's all Logitech software side, so I can't just send it back to get a replacement, it'll just be the same deal. So I'm now attempting to get a refund. By the way, the box is made of trash, it rips at a teasing touchs and falls apart like the trashiest Pizza box, no, pizza boxes can handle at least two pounds. This thing was falling apart the moment I took it from the shipping box.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_134?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=134&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Han","Not bad, but not great either.....","January 5, 2016","This is my initial thought on the g29 as I just received it last night and have played it for couple of hours.  So far its just an ok wheel for me.  I am coming from g25, and have used thrustmaster T300 rs (a friend of mine has this one)  First of all I will not be taking out a star (or give one star) cause Logitech wont update their g25/27 driver to work with ps4.  As much as I am pissed about that too, its just business ppl.  live w it. At the end its all about money if you run a business.  I don't care what company, they are all the same. So live with it ppl, we can bitch about it all we want but don't give it a one star when this is suppose to be a review of the product.  We are here to help others to choose the right product.

soooo... why the three star, you ask..... cause for the money, its just an ok product for me.
First, lets start with what you get for the money, or to be exact, what you don't get.  The god damn shifter should've been included for this price.  so I took off half a star.  I don't care what Logitech says.... they took it out cause more money and ppl will still buy it.

Second, the paddle shifter.... its so god damn mushy. it has no click feel to it..(Hey, Logi, if you are not going to include the shifter, at least make your paddle better)  My g25 has better click feel then this. what were you thinking Logi.... Thrustmaster def has better feel on this department too.  So another half star....  If you are an auto only person, then this shouldn't matter...

Third, they really need to make their steering wheel bigger.  Never realized this until i tried my friends Thrustmaster.  Also the button lay out is not the greatest.  the L2,R2 buttons are too close to the center and just over all too many buttons. Maybe I will get use to it as I use it more.  No star taken off.

Forth, and this is my MAIN COMPLAINT,  the force feedback and the knocking noise.  Let me start off with the noise this motor makes... WTF!!!! seriously....W....T.....F......... clah,clah,clah....da.da.dadadaaddaadadada....clank..  ""shuuuuut uuuuuuppppp!! I JUST WANT TO PLAY!!!!!! BAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH""  CLANK, CLANK....PAPAPAPA DA. DA. DA. DDDDDAAAAADAAAAAAA.. enough said.
now, the force feedback.  May the force be with you... did you see what I did there? hahaha...... sorry..........  So its not so much about the force feedback itself.... it has plenty of that when you are turing your wheel.. more turn = more force... good.  The problem is that theres no force in the middle.  you feel no connection (no FFB) for the first 5-10 degrees on each direction.  Now this might not be a problem if you only drive slow cars in the game... but when you are driving fast cars.. man oh man..... (In this department Thrustmaster has it down) Another problem I have is that the wheel comes back to the center too slow.....  I tend to let go of the wheel(on certain situations) on a tight turn so the wheel will center it as im passing the apex of a turn, as this gives a better, smoother wheel turn. (like I said, not all the time.. and if you don't know what im talking about, you aint gonna get it.. ;)  )  Problem w this wheel is that first, it returns too slowly (my g25 turned back faster) and second, once its back its hard to keep it straight as theres no force in the middle causing the wheel to turn slightly but enough to mess up a smooth exit.  So one full star off

Now you would ask me... ""Hey, then why not the TM T300?  It seems like it has better force feedback and its cheeper, has a better wheel size, buttons are not clustered, you can take out the wheel(don't care about different wheels, easier to store) according to you""  ..... well two things.... their pedals are garbage but most of all it seems like they have an issue w the wheels, where they fail a lot and its a known issue. (well I'm judging by ppls reviews...) and I don't want to fork over 300+ for something thats going to break in few months... (and it seems like its a nightmare to get a hold of TM for customer service.)

The wheel and pedal def has better build quality then TM and looks cooler(?) but as of now its just an ok wheel for me. Especially for this price.  and no, don't tell me to go buy a 1000 dollar wheel.  Oh and that stupid led lights for sifting point?? yeah... that bitch is too small and located too low, you aint going to utilize it.  I'll just look at my screen thank u very much.

Hope this review helped... like I said it's not a bad wheel, its just average.

Update: (Feb 22nd 2016)  Been using this wheel for a while now..... and its still an ok wheel.. Logi really needs to scale up the steering wheel size.  and I have mixed feelings about the new brake feel... I know they advertise as better/ more realistic brake feel but it just feels a bit odd for me... the travel distance is too short  and when it gets close to the limit the brake feels really mushy. (very subjective....)  and that god damn deadzone in the middle is really annoying.. and yes.. the motor knocking sound is still annoying too.  So yeah........ this will prob be my last logi wheel I buy...  (so far I have played drive club, crew and project cars on ps4, no pc so far)","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_103?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=103&reviewerType=all_reviews"

First it began behaving erratically. After that, it began disconnecting and going ""off center"" while I was driving, resulting in much confusion and multiple system restarts so the wheel could ""calibrate.""

After that, it started only calibrating correctly occasionally. Otherwise, it would sit there twitching with the LED RPM gauge fully lit and the light on top flashing.

Mind you this is only after using with light force-feedback settings.

I've placed a call to Logitech and they have assured me they will fix it, but that doesn't really fix the fact that I blew a significant portion of my graduation money on a gift for myself that I may spend the first several weeks of summer fixing. The guy on call told me that the G29's have been having an issue like what I am experiencing, so I wouldn't recommend buying it if you are dead-set on using it within a week or two after it arrives.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

And don't get me wrong, this thing is very fun and I still use it. I bought this specifically to play Forza on Xbox One. Bought it as soon at Forza Horizon 3 came out. It is fantastic for that game. It really is a good time, driving is easy and fun. Hint, use 480 degrees turning on the wheel setting for video games. 900 degrees is just too much.

The pedals feel like a real car, the gas is light and easy to push, the clutch is medium and the brake is hard. The shifter does not feel like a real car at all. I can shift into any gear by literally flicking my finger at the shift knob. I wish there was more weight to it. Also, in today's day, most cars have more than 6 gears. This shifter only has 6 so if you are playing with a car with more gears, you are out of luck.

The steering wheel is ehhh. It does not feel like a real car at all. The steering wheel is soooo tiny and not even close to a real car and the force feedback is weird, it just shakes the steering wheel. Doesn't have a ""real car"" feel even a little bit.

The thing that I really like about this wheel is how much fun it is to play on arcade racing games like Need for Speed or Forza Horizon. Once you get into the real racing sims like Forza 7, it is nearly impossible to drive. I use a controller on that game cause the steering wheel is so unrealistic and hard to use that it is just not fun.

If I were going to buy another racing sim, I would honestly save more money and get the Fanatec setup. It's such a better experience.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_124?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=124&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Poor Brake Pedal","September 18, 2019","The wheel itself is well made, high quality materials. But unfortunately, mine came with a stiff brake pedal, which resulted in a poor racing experience.

As of now typing this review it's $300. That's a 25% drop of price in just a week of purchase. So my rating/review reflects this too.
For $400 (+$60~ for the shifter)...It's a rip off. For $300 (+$60 shift) still high but at least reasonable/cheaper against its competition.

--Brakes--
Only using this wheel for Forza 6. First time diving into a corner with the wheel...NO BRAKES!!! Literally NO BRAKES! I have no idea why would Logitech think this is ""ACCURATE BRAKING FEEL"" per say on their web. Heck I never raced Pro Open Wheel, or in a Hydraulic Pedal operated machine, but damn you can skip leg day with this. Mad respect to real professional drivers if there brake pedals are this hard or require this much strength, or heck even with drivers that drive with no vacuum, and brake boosters.

So with the BS brake pedal. I removed the rubber stopper inside the brake assembly. AND GOD DAMN! MUCH BETTER. Pedal feel is like kart pedal feeling. Initially stiff, and then light, and then stiff again when nearly fully depressed. Not brick like with the rubber stopper on. Cars I owned has a brake pedal .3-.5inch play, and LIGHT. As you depressed more, resistance builds up (real brakes).

--Wheel--
It's nice. The button controls are in the wheel. So no need to use a controller to navigate. My Forza 6 Settings feedback is at 40, and vibration at 15 (not sure if wheel thing). Going through a apex stripes. Feedback disappears at this settings though. I left at this settings because this is the weight am used too (real). Also caster settings actually effects the wheel too, very nice.

--Table Clamp--
It's plastic, and holds well to the table.

--Pedal Floor Grip--
I have hard floors, and it slides as you repeatedly depressed the pedals. Then you will need to pause the game or slow down (multiplayer) to readjust. Best to leave a heavy book in the back, or a fixed stationary object behind.

--Shifter (Purchased Separately)--
$60...Toy like, and VERY short throw. Better than the Fanatec CSR Shifter Set.
(My personal preference. Not really into VERY/SUPER short throws.)

In conclusion if I purchased this at $300 (including Shifter). I'll be happy. However paid $460, and need to do some DIY (brake pedal). To make this usable. Not worth it.

If I only saved an additional $150~, and waited. I would have gotten the Thrustmaster. Thrustmaster has better steering feedack, better pedal feel (brake still stiff), and the shifter is very sturdy.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_143?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=143&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's excellent fun in games and does what I expect... however there's a few issues.
Let's start with the pros!

TL:DR: It's a great wheel and the best for value however you can sort of feel where the higher end options may be better. For most everyone besides extremely serious sim racers this is an amazing wheel and I'd definitely recommend. And for the sim drivers out there, $1,000 direct drive wheels are the way to go.

Edit: The sound has gone away after some use of the wheel. Probably just needed to be broken in

[Pros]
- Decent build quality, pretty durable (it's only been a few days)

- Competitive price. The Thrustmaster equivalent is a few hundred dollars more depending on where you look (I got this wheel for $200 on sale... thrustmaster equiv. is ~$500)

- It works... pretty well at that!

- Great clamping system!

- Great feeling pedals (with the exception of a small thing mentioned in the cons)

[Cons]
- An infernal screeching noise when turning the wheel to the left... lack of lubrication? This issue has been reported by a handful of users as well (I may request a replacement)

- I needed to do a quick mod to remove some tiny little stopper on the brake pedal that only allowed for maybe an inch of travel. This, and a shifter mod, are supposedly the most common things and a majority of people opt for this... annoying but it took only about 25 minutes and a simple screwdriver

- Since it's a gear driven FFB system there's (very very minor) inconsistencies in the feedback- little jumps sorta... and again with this gear driven system, it's kinda slow to turn from left lock to right lock. For basic racing this isn't even noticeable, however if you plan to drift or do rallycross I suggest investing in belt driven or direct drive (these options cost an arm and a leg)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sometimes it works, and it was pretty good when it worked.

But more more usually, when I turn the game on to play, everything seems to go fine until the game starts. As soon as I start loading into the track, the wheel goes limp. You can still use the buttons to start the game, but after that, the wheel is 100% totally unresponsive to any input. Until I use the keyboard to exit out and try again. Then, I troubleshoot the device for an hour, always thinking I've almost figured it out. After all, I've spent a significant amount of time reading about problems on the internet and the common solutions. And sometimes the solutions work. Plugging and unplugging USB devices. Calibrating the wheel. Clearing settings and reloading. Restarting the computer. Trying other power outlets. Unless you want to waste a minimum of 50% of your time getting this wheel to work, find something not made by logitech, and buy that. You might get lucky and get a good wheel. But if you're like me, you are not patient enough to return a wheel once you have it. Just buy something else.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_148?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=148&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought this primarily to play formula 1 and this simply does not match up. The mappings are horribly wrong, the force feedback is below par for product at this price.  The two stars are for quality of the materials on just the wheel. The pedal unit is a tad bit light and so quite often it will slip depending on the floor surface. So in the end I returned and swapped it for the Thrustmaster T500 which is way better than this one. Also note that with the T500 one can always add-on the Ferrari wheel.

- Quality is fine (yes there's plastic, but the grip is good, the buttons work fine, and it doesn't feel cheap to me).
- The brake pedal bushing that everyone complains about is a non-issue, in my opinion; the pedals work fine without any modifications, and my games let me adjust the progression anyway.
- I'm mounting it to a glass desk that is barely more than 1/4in thick, and there are no mounting issues.
- The pedals are sitting on the floor (carpeted) without anything to secure them, and they haven't slid around once, even when I mashed the brake.
- I installed the Logitech gaming software (from their web site) to customize the buttons, etc., and it's fine.

It is nice that the G27 shifter works with the G920, so I did not have to purchase the separate shifter. The new brake pedal resistance feels a lot more like a real brake pedal than the G27.

I had watched a review that compared the G29/G920 to the G27 that actually showed the G29. I did not notice that there are no rev/shift indicator LEDs on top of this wheel like there are on the G27 and G29. I'm assuming that this is because the feature is not supported by the XBOX One, but it would have been nice to have them included for PC games. I suppose this means I'll be using my G27 wheel and shifter with the G920 pedals for PC games now(assuming that the G920 pedals will operate properly with the G27).

The reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of five is that I am annoyed at having to purchase this, when it is nearly identical to the G27. It's also basically the same as the G29, but you have to buy ""that one"" if you want it to work on PS4. Controller/accessory licensing on consoles has gotten out of hand. Not a Logitech issue, but it is still an issue. It would be awesome if Logitech could start selling the wheel alone, with or without the motor assembly, since that is the only real difference.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_122?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=122&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was told the pedals on the 29 & 920 are the exact same. So I bought the G920, lo and behold the brake only had about 50-60% use/travel. I opened up the pedals (~16 screws & a 6mm allen wrench/10mm box wrench) and found a 1/2x1/2x15/16"" rubber bushing in with the pedal spring. Seeing that the full pedal travel is 1 & 1/2"" and the bushing is 15/16"", it's easy to see this bushing is the cause of the problem. Improvement suggestion, remove the bushing and have a fully functional product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_155?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=155&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I am still using it with the PS3 because it's so awesome but, sadly, it's not allowed on the PS4. So, enter the new and slightly improved G29.

Besides it being compatible with both the PS3 and PS4, the improvements, when compared to my old GT, other than the vastly higher price include:

- Clutch pedal and the pedals are much nicer because of chrome
- RPM/shift indicator LEDs which are Okay but when racing I can't say that I look at them much and there's no stick with this wheel unless purchased separately
- Dual motor force feedback which is probably a good thing but the feedback seems to be the same of the GT so, Okay
- PS4 controls other than the touchpad are on the wheel vs. PS3 controls on the GT

Other than that, the G29 acts on the PS4 (and PS3) more or less the same as the GT does on the PS3. The steering wheel is slightly smaller but it's still nice leather and the pedals board is, of course, larger, because of the third pedal. Grips to the table and to the floor are okay. I was able to attach the wheel to our old, GT-compatible driving seat without a problem but the pedals board was more difficult because the Velcro bands used on the GT do not attach so well on the back of the G29 but we made them work, sort of.

I am somewhat disappointed by this model (same as GTs) abundance of wires and lack of any meaningful wire management. There's a wire from the wheel to the power brick, then a wire from the power brick to the electric outlet. Then, you have a wire from the pedals platform to the wheel body. Then, there's the USB wire from the wheel to the PS4 and if you are going to buy the stick there's going to be a wire from the wheel to the stick. If the Dualshock controllers can be wireless, perhaps the Driving Force which is basically 'a controller' could be wireless too. At this price, it's not such an unrealistic expectation.

Now, for the driving experience, it's still great. Sadly, there is no Gran Turismo on the PS4 yet and Drive Club has great graphics but it doesn't come close. However, it feels great to take a car on the road with the G29. I don't believe that it's such a great improvement over the GT or the other like models that Logitec made for the PS3 and I would have used the GT on the PS4 if it was compatible but, things being the way they are, G29 it is. Hope the price comes down. A lot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_148?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=148&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If it was cheaper, I would say it's worth it. At the price point its at, the quality is inexcusable. I read a lot of reviews saying the pedals are too stiff. I thought maybe it was just a manufacturer error on some units. Boy was I wrong. The desk clamps slide so much that when you turn the wheel to correct an oversteer it flings off your desk.

They are quick to blame game companies for not supporting this wheel, but they wouldn't have to if Logitech would follow some sort of, I don't know, CONVENTION??? Come on, Logitech... how many years will it be before you discover game consoles and Windows personal computers are two different things?  I should have read the one star reviews more carefully, as this is a KNOWN ISSUE.  Pedal assignments are wrong and button assignments are backwards in NFS 2016.  For F1 2017, the wheel is only recognized part of the time.  I only bought this thing because the clamps on my Logitech G25 wheel finally gave out after 10 years or so.  This G920 is going back. I will do more research before buying another game console device ""that also works on PC"".  Oh, yeah... two other things.  Good luck cranking this wheel more than a half turn; the lower flat spot will make you loose grip.  The other thing, is the stupid, ultra bright, white LED by the X-Box button.  I covered it with three layers of blue painter's tape to be able to see it without blinding me.  Anyway, now I understand why USED G25 and G27 wheels sell for MUCH more than these new pieces of junk.  Logitech just lost my business... permanently.  And Amazon?  You guys should know better, and probably would if you actually read these reviews.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The wheel has pretty decent quality, but really isn't worth it in the end if you're looking for a wheel for the PC/PS3. If you're looking for a wheel for the PS4 you've got very few options.

The wheel:
Aside from the compatibility issues, the one major complaint I have with this wheel is that it's very toylike. It doesn't feel like a real steering wheel at all despite its ""hand-stitched leather"" and steel components. I don't understand why logitech won't increase the size of their steering wheels to a size even remotely close to the size of a real steering wheel. The lack of buttons from the g27 is noticeable, but at least it works out of the box with the PS4 and functions very well with it in my opinion. The paddle shifters feel amazing in my opinion, and are constructed out of stainless steel which not only has a nice finish but feels very durable and responsive.

The pedals:
The pedals feel great and are easily one of the better features of this wheel set. From the g27 they upgraded the brake pedal to simulate a load cell and it feels much better than previously, though still not quite as realistic as other options out there. I wish the floor mount of the pedals was constructed out of aluminum so it wouldn't look as cheap as it does, but it is a fairly durable plastic at least.

The H-shifter:
Now I know the H-shifter is not included, but it's basically part of the g29 package that you instead have to fork over an additional $60 to receive. If you're upgrading from the g27 for whatever reason, do NOT buy the separate h-shifter. It is completely identical minus the additional buttons from the g27. It still feels extremely toylike, and if you're buying this wheel strictly for the PC I wouldn't recommend buying the separate shifter. There are better, more realistic shifters out there well worth the additional cost. The thrustmaster th8a comes to mind, and is fully compatible with the wheel so long as you have an extra USB port available on your PC. If you're looking for a shifter that's compatible with both your PC and the PS4 with your g29 wheel then you're SOL.

Overall, I really don't think it's worth getting this wheel over the g27 unless you need a wheel for the PS4 as not only does it cost $100 more currently, it doesn't come with the H-shifter that the g27 includes, bringing the price difference to about $160 when you add the separate h-shifter's cost. The only real difference is the fact that it allows for PS4 compatibility (as artificial of a benefit as that is), and the brake more accurately simulates a load cell brake. The wheel is still extremely toylike but will get the job done if you're not looking for 100% immersion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_63?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=63&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It makes driving games incredibly immersive and fun.  Forza Motorsports 7 allows you to change the amount of brake throw that is needed for 100% braking, which is extremely useful with the G920's stiffer pedal.  The feel of the pedal is great, but it's extremely hard to depress the pedal fully, especially if the pedals and chair are not fastened together in some kind of cockpit rig.  Not all games allow you to change the ""curve"" of the brake pedal in that way.  Assetto Corsa--which is quite fun, and a little more of a sim feel--lacks that adjustment in the xbox version (the PC version has it), so I'm unable to reach more than about 90% braking force in the game, which has a huge impact for any competitive driving.  Project Cars II also allows you to change the brake range, but as far as I can tell, The Crew does not.  I believe Forza Horizons 3 & 4 share the same ""deadzone"" setting that Forza Motorsports has.  Unfortunately, without a wheel connected to your system, generally you cannot see the relevant settings to check if they exist in a game you enjoy.

One thing to note about this wheel--as long as it is connected to your xbox and to power, when you turn on the xbox (without even touching the wheel), the wheel will run through a calibration, where it rotates fully in both directions.  If you have a chair pushed in against the wheel when that happens, it can get a little exciting.  I've been careful to keep things clear of the wheel, but I can imagine the leather wrapping could get pretty scuffed up on accident this way.  Simply disconnect the USB cable (or unplug the power cord) to avoid this.

The clamping mechanism is really easy to use, and it's extremely effective--much better than the old Microsoft Wheel for the Xbox 360, which is the only other wheel I can compare it to.  Finger tight on the two knobs locks the wheel down completely--no amount of rapid turning against strong force feedback will twist it loose.

The buttons are all easy to press while driving, and roughly mirror the positions on a stock controller.  The LSB and RSB buttons reproduce pressing down on the analog sticks of the stock controller.  Not all games support these buttons on the wheel (Project Cars II definitely does--I have not found them to work in Forza however, which makes it hard to access some portions of the game, like Forzavista, context help in Tuning, etc.--fortunately, this doesn't impact any controls while driving, and you can launch the game with a normal controller to use those other functions).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Set up was simple but the racing wheel is not something that you’re going to want to be laying around your living room due to its large size.  There are multiple wires that connect the wheel to the pedals and to the PS3.  My son has a gaming room so it is perfect in there since we don't get fussy over orderliness in this room.

First problem we had was that the older PS3 games we already owned were not compatible with this model of racing wheel.  We purchased Gran Turismo 6 used and were finally able to test this product out.  The racing wheel is really cool and gives you a real life feel of driving a race car.  It drives very much like what you'd experience in an Arcade.  You'll want however to buy the stand to mount this equipment on or build a stand to place the wheel on to use it most effectively (which just adds to the already bloated price of this equipment).  The racing wheel does have built in table clamps.  I also like that it can be used for PS3 or PS4 in the event you plan to upgrade to the newer system.  Figuring out however which driving games will work with this driving system is a little confusing.

This feels very realistic and if you love gaming and you're not deterred by the large price tag, I believe that you'll feel that this is money well invested.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_153?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=153&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you are also planning to use it on PC, don't buy this wheel as it doesn't support many games. Only the most recent games are supported. Check Logitech website for supported game before you buy this. I called their tech support and although they were nice, i was told only a handful of most recent games are supported.

The wheel feels good, however the tachometer LED doesn't work on PS3, I think it only works on PS4.  The base for the pedals is so large that I couldn't fit it on my PlaySeat and had to modify the Playseat to accommodate it. the placement of the break and clutch pedals are so close to each other.

It's very sturdy and the leather finish paired with the stainless steel paddles and pedals are a very nice touch. Huge upgrade over our previous plastic wheel. We were previously using the Thrustmaster T80, which is much cheaper but also riddled with problems, so we were thrilled to try out the G29. I incorrectly assumed the stick shift was included with this as they are mentioned together frequently, but unfortunately that's a separate purchase. I can't comment on it for that reason, but I do plan to pick it up and will update my review when I've spent some time with it. That's where my complaints end on the G29.

We tried the G29 with DriveClub, Project Cars, Need for Speed Rivals, Rocket League, and Gran Turismo 6 on PS4 and countless more on PS3. It did not work for GTA V or The Crew. It's working well with our PC games, so far Euro Truck Simulator 2015, BeamNG.drive, and Spintires. Set up is extremely easy and the system recognizes the wheel right away. Controls are extremely responsive, and the feedback you get from driving is very realistic. You can feel the difference in terrain via the wheel and can instantly tell the difference between rough and smooth roads. Off-roading is great as well. You can use the wheel to control your entire system also, so you don't have to swap out your regular controller to navigate the menus and such when selecting your game, which is a nice bonus.

The pedals are also equally responsive, and feel weighted like a real car. The brakes are dampened as well so the harder you break, the more resistance you feel. One of the greatest features is the row of spikes that pop up from underneath the pedals to hook into your carpet and keep it from sliding around. This is a fantastic feature and really does it's job keeping the pedals in place. This makes it even more feasible to just use a table as a stand as you don't need a proper foot rest for the pedals to keep them from sliding. We have a racing stand, but it's a bit too big for my 10-year-old, so I'm thrilled with this option so he can play comfortably.

Last thing I want to mention is the noise. There is no noise from the wheel despite the powerful motor. The steel bearings allow it to run smoothly and silently. Overall this wheel is extremely well made and everything it promises to be. I didn't own the G27, but I understand it's made huge improvements over the last generation and it's certainly an upgrade over our previous wheel. For racing enthusiasts, it doesn't get any better than this. Logitech has been a favorite for PC accessories for years and they continue to keep up their line of high quality products for consoles as well. Highly recommended and worth every penny.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_156?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=156&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've been using a Logitech Driving Force GT wheel and although it's perfectly adequate and amazingly durable considering how much use it's seen, the G29 is a huge step up in every aspect.  First for setting it up - all the wires connect in a neat little compartment under the steering wheel enclosure.  The USB, power cable, cable from the pedals, and if you buy the optional shifter, that also attaches inside this compartment.  All wires exit neatly out the front which helps avoid the big mess of cables you can get with steering wheels.

When I turned it on the wheel rotated back and forth quietly and smoothly -  a big change from my DFGT which would noisily smack itself back and forth while centering.  This wheel works perfectly with Gran Turismo 6 on the PlayStation 3;  it's silky smooth and has wonderful force feedback.  It's also MUCH quieter than my DFGT.  The large paddle shifters work perfectly and have a nice click when engaged.  The pedals are metal and extremely solid, and the base has a flip-out ""comb"" type thing which holds it firmly in place on carpeting.  It also has rubberized feet it you're on a bare floor.

Overall the G29 is just a dream to play with.  Smooth as silk, high quality pedals and those wonderful paddle shifters.  My only nitpick is that the series of lights on the wheel which indicate your engine RPM don't work with GT6 on the PS3, but I imagine that's because this is a new product and they probably have to update the drivers or something.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_159?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=159&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The problem is that the wheel keeps disconnecting","January 24, 2017","I cannot compare the wheel to any other wheel, because this is the first wheel I've ever owned.  However, there is a slight problem with it.  I am running this wheel on Windows 10.  Had no problem downloading software and programming the buttons to work for American Truck Simulator.  When the wheel is connected, everything works great.  The problem is that the wheel keeps disconnecting, recalibrating and starting back up.  I have not been able to complete a trip without having to hit the pause button between 2 and 5 times and wait for the wheel to recalibrate so I can continue.  I have gone to Logitech to look for and try to get help with this problem, but so far there have been no answers.  If anyone here knows how to fix this problem, please let me know.  If a tech with Logitech contacts me with the fix, I will come back here and add it to this post to help out anyone else who may be having this problem.

The problem with some of these wheels are that there is a glitch or bug in either the wiring or maybe the circuit board, not sure which, which is causing the wheel to disconnect from the PC.  Not getting any help from Logitech, I finally exchanged the wheel for another one.  Plugged the new wheel into my PC and have been using it for a little more than a month now, with no problems.  Everything I need the wheel to do, it does it.  Since I will only be using this wheel for ATS and ETS2, I shouldn't have to do any hard turning from full left to full right, or the other direction, I feel that this wheel should last me a long time.  If anyone is having a problem with their wheel disconnecting from their PC and can't get it to stop, I suggest that you exchange it for another one.

I also have a g27 that is miles better however does not work on ps4. I have used the g29 on ps4 and pc and very unsatisfied with my decision to purchase from logitech. Needless to say I won't purchase Logitech anymore. Driving force gt you could hear the force feedback loud and clear over bumps and curbs. Understandable for $130. I beat the piss out of the dfgt for 3 years, gave it to my nephew 2 yrs ago and he is still abusing it. Awsome wheel. G27 I've had for 2 yrs and can feel the force feedback but not hear it. It's quiet and came with the shifter for $299 full price. I purchased g27 off Amazon for $225. Now this g29 (pos) is not only louder than the dfgt but on older f1 game with KERS I can also hear clicks and cracks while driving. There is no way this wheel is gonna hold up like the older models do. Not to mention the fact Logitech came up with this as a last minute option therefore limiting time game developer have/had to program into the games. Some new game still don't support the wheel at all and the only game I have found that it works decently on is Project Cars. F1 2015  it somewhat functions. Wheel weight is non existing and force feedback is limited and everytime you load the game you have to go to setting and reset-up the wheel. This is on both pc and ps4. New Logitech profiler is absolute garbage compared to previous profilers. Half the settings you need for the steering wheel, that you used to have, don't exist now and the setting that are available don't transfer into the game like they should. I've not used the g29 near as much as I have the other and the wrapping is starting to come off the wheel. This has NEVER been an issue in the past. So, for $400 you get a lower quality driving force gt with a clutch. If you want a wheel buy the thrustmaster or fanatec. Here I was worried about thrustmasters quality as they have always been garbage but that what all my friends are on and they are completely satisfied.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_155?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=155&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I say this as an owner of the previous Logitech G27 Racing Wheel for over five years.  From all indications the G29 is built to the same standards as the G27 and I would expect the lifespan and reliability to be similar.

Now that said, the two wheels are not *exactly* the same - the differences I am aware of are:
- The G29 costs about $80 more than the G27 when it first came out.  Value wise the G27 is better.
- The G29 does not come with a shifter like the G27 does, instead it is a separate purchase.  Another plus for the G27, though I will say this isn't a big issue for me as I use the paddle shifters on the wheel almost exclusively.
- The G29 is built to be compatible with the Sony PS4, while at this time the G27 cannot be used with the PS4.
- Though this can be used on both the PS4 and a PC, the button layout obviously lend itself to PS4 use.  (I am using it on a PC, mainly for iRacing.)
- The brake pedal has been modified to more closely resemble how an actual car brake feels - the pedal moves much less and encounters increasing resistance as the pedal is pushed down.  I like how the G29 succeeds in making the pedal feel a bit closer to a car's brake, but my son who races more than I do is not as impressed and prefers the G27 brake.  In all, this is a case of ""different"" but not necessarily ""better"".

So I would call this a 4-star product for PS4 users and a 3-star product for PC / PS3 users - except I have to dock the G29 for Logitech's poor after-warranty support.  Many parts on the G27 and G29 are made of plastic and can break, and other parts (the potentiometers or ""pots"" in the pedal system in particular) will wear out over time.  Logitech only had one spare part available for the G27 (the power adapter) has currently has no spare parts for the G29.  So if a part breaks or wears out and you are out of the warranty issue you will get no help whatsoever from Logitech.  In my case I asked about a lost screw that attaches the G27 shifter to a table and about worn out pedal pots - in each case Logitech said there was nothing they could do.  That might be tolerable for a cheap controller or mouse, but I do not consider a $400 racing wheel a throwaway product and I find this level of support unacceptable.

The fact that previous G27 owners are forced to upgrade to the G29 to race on the PS4 is also unfortunate (though I understand that this is at least partly Sony's fault).

So overall a solid if overpriced product.  I will enjoy this wheel as long as it remains trouble-free, but I know that after the warranty expires any support from Logitech is likely to be non-existent.  Also noted that the new generation of wheels (G29 and G920) has reduced the warranty from three years to two.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_144?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=144&reviewerType=all_reviews"

A new unit has been arranged to be sent to my house, and I am highly satisfied with how efficiently things turned out on the support end, which compelled me to write this review. Moving on to the wheel itself, it is visually appealing and built with quality material. The wrapping on the wheel may be vinyl, I'm not sure exactly what material, but its holds up well with the look of the rest of the wheel. I was reluctant at first to buy it because I wanted a wheel with quality and wasn't sure where to start, but now that I have it I can say that the investment was solid. The software and framework is easy to work with. For the most part things are integrated pretty well and you could plug and play using options from the games you are playing. Most racing games register the device and it is easy to find when you want to switch from the keyboard or controller. I myself use the wheel and pedals and decided not to get the shifter, so I use my keyboard for shifting instead, which works very well. I can simultaneously use the wheel and my keyboard at the same time. On the performance end it is very responsive and works well for every driving or racing game. If I want to play Spintires or American Truck Simulator, the pedals and steering respond to my inputs well even if I am lightly touching the throttle or brake. The steering response is practically down to the millimeter and the force feedback immerses me into those games even more. I should note that I don't use force feedback in the high speed games as it's just a preference but in the few times I have tried it, I have felt every bump and every crest on the rally courses of DiRT Rally.  My racing and drifting experiences have been great with this wheel. I can honestly say that I have no complaints about this product, and I have no regrets buying it whatsoever. It mounts well by the way too","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Force feedback is great although takes a little getting used to and the clunking sounds from inside the wheel are the only thing that keeps you from feeling like you're really holding the wheel of a race car. Plenty of buttons to map out controls although some are not very easy to reach without taking a hand off the wheel so keep that in mind when mapping controls.
The pedals have some weight to them and on hardwood, will stay in place most of the time. There's even teeth on the bottom to help grab the carpet. I do have wide feet so the pedals are kind of hard to use because they are very close together.
Be careful of the wheel when it's first plugged in or turned on. It turns both directions lock to lock so be clear.
I already have a G430 headset from Logitech so they share the same gaming app on windows although I had to reset my headset for some reason. Making my speakers default then changing back to my headset fixed that.

The brake is a little stiff to push down and can make the pedals scoot forward slightly. Other than that this has severely improved my experience with this game.

Claybourne","Ruined By Left Turns","November 1, 2017","I have a Logitech G25 and have had for years. It works well with my PC and my PS2, but now that I have an Xbox One I wanted to switch over to something I could actually use with it, enter the logical upgrade to the G920. It feels similar to the G25, though the build quality is not as good. The stitched leather on the wheel had some frayed stitches and the switches didn’t feel as nice. The power LED on the wheel itself is also very bright, a terrible idea for a device likely to be used in a dim room. In my initial tests I absolutely hated the brake pedal, which has extra resistance halfway through the travel. I did a lot of reading up on it, some seem to love it, others hate it. If you play simulation with ABS off it is tolerable, like I do in Forza 6. However, in a more arcade environment or with ABS on (Horizon 3) it is very, very annoying as it is almost impossible to get 100% braking pressure without feeling like you’re going to break the thing, or remapping the dead zones, which to me should not be needed in something retailing for $399. I actually switched in using my G25 pedals and was much happier. I hear there is a mod to change the pedals on the G920 to remove the piece of resistance, but it voids the otherwise generous warranty. Fortunately I didn’t, because shortly after the wheel started making a high pitches squealing sound everytime I turned left, power on or off. It’s loud enough you can’t drown it out and, in my opinion is unacceptable for a $399 product, especially as, after years of play, my G25 has no such issues. From what I’ve read mine is hardly an isolated issue, some going through multiple wheels before they got one that was at least tolerably quiet. As such, I returned the wheel and will wait for an unbeatable price or verified improvements in Logitech’s quality control. A shame as I have never had any issues with the company before, and I’ve bought a bit of their gear. Also irritating at how limited the range of Xbox wheels is as it can certainly enhance your game. Till then I’ll be back on the PC with the G25.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Also bought a race seat from OpenWheeler to go with it.

Docking a star from the G920 because the brake pedal is ridiculous. Somebody at Logitech had the bright idea to stick a rubber block in the brake pedal shaft that basically makes pushing the brakes down impossible. Most games you'll need to use the same force as Crocodile's mouth to get 100% brake force unless you're willing to open up the G920 pedals and remove the stupid rubber block (and most likely, voiding your warranty in the process.) Some really should be fired for that decision.

Brake pedal aside, it's a great wheel! I haven't bought a new wheel since my old Logitech Driving Force Pro in the PS2 days with GranTurismo 3 and 4. It's kind of crazy spending an additional $750 (wheel + shifter + seat) for a single game I can play in VR, but it was totally worth it. I haven't REALLY enjoyed a racing game (with the exception of Wipeout) for a very long time, and the realism of the Vive + this wheel + the race seat makes it all worth it.

Bought this one instead of the G29 because I like the cleaner look of the G920, and more familiar with Xbox button placement instead of shapes which I can never remember the placement of.

As always, Logitech's high end stuff is good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_65?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=65&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After deleting the default drivers in Windows 10 this went away and then the device did not work.

2.
After finally getting the drivers to work I get to use the brilliantly put together ""Logitech Profiler"" which takes several minutes to start on its own because each time it has to build some ""game database"" which is not network activity mine you - it's thrashing your disk - and this is on a modern i7 system with an SSD.

3.
After unplugging the wheel and turning the computer off for a day - it now does not work again (wheel turns on, calibrates itself, but is not detected by the all knowing Logitech Profiler and does not work in games.

I had the same problem with the Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 Spider Wheel that was half the price of the Logitech G920 Wheel. This is why I bought the Logitech. It seems to be an issue with most wheels.

I purchased the wheel to replace a Thrustmaster T80 RS PS4/PS3 Officially Licensed Racing Wheel which served me quite well for how cheap it was. I wanted the ""road feel"" I had none of with the cheap T80. After reading thread after thread about Thrustmaster VG T300RS Officially Licensed PS4/PS3 Force Feedback Racing Wheel or Thrustmaster T500RS Racing Wheel - Playstation 3 failing - I didn't want to risk that amount of money.  I just couldn't bring myself to do it - so I bought this wheel and the matching shifter (Logitech G Driving Force Shifter (941-000119)). I do think that their belt system likely feels better than the G29's gears.

Project CARS - PlayStation 4 is my main reference - I just don't care for Driveclub no matter how much I try. I only have ~2 hours of seat time with this wheel - but here are my initial thoughts (+ pro) (~ neutral) (- con):

+ The leather is stitched beautifully and smells great. The plastics are of high quality as are all the buttons. Its quality of materials is superb; better than the T80 by many fold (which for $ is expected).

+ The quality of pedals is astounding. They beat the feel of most real cars with excellent progression and placement. The base is heavy and extremely high quality. Color me impressed here.

+ The force feedback can be quite strong and does help ""realism"". It isn't all perfect as I'll get to in the cons below. In Project Cars make sure you have Steering Deadzone set to Zero. Otherwise recovering from a spin is impossible. The force feedback makes catching a slide very difficult and this setting exacerbates it greatly.

+ 900 degrees of turning radius is a huge benefit, much more than I thought before trying it. I now can do Monaco (Azure Circuit) which is actually impossible in the T80. Its beneficial on almost every track though - I didn't notice before how often I got to full-lock.

~ The force-feedback motors provide the steering weight. This feels a bit... grainy? Hard to come up with the right descriptor. Imagine if your real steering wheel was missing half of its ball bearings - feels about like that. For steering weight (and that alone) the T80 was actually better.

~ Using the add-on shifter in Project Cars with the Audi IMSA GTO is hilariously fun. I spent 20 minutes last night doing reverse J-turns having a blast.  The add-on shifter is fun - but does feel disconnected compared to the wheel. I think it would benefit from some stiffening bushings or even vibration when you notch it into gear. I didn't realize how much feel you get through the stick in a real car until I tried this.

- The paddle shifters need too much pressure. You get used to it but the T80 I used prior had a much more tactile click when switching gears. I've driven several cars with paddles (F430, M3, M5, etc..) and they all felt more crisp. A little sad that the $80 cheapo wheel beats this one in this regard.

- The quality of the wheel itself is a little flimsy. You can watch it flex when you use the paddle shifters which is disappointing. Would be nice if they used thicker metal or some structural bends to boost rigidity.

- The price! With the pedals this is nearly half a thousand dollars. That is approaching a month's payment on my 2012 BMW 750!

Overall its a solid ""B-"" that could easily be made an ""A-"" when on sale.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_139?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=139&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After two weeks of use, I am happy to report that the Logitech G29 is an excellent racing wheel. This was my very first wheel, purchased after conducting extensive research. When you grip it in your hands, you can feel the sheer quality of its materials - from its leather covering, to realistic feeling weighted pedals. Its settings are thoroughly adjustable, and it also highly compatible with all major racing games on both the PS4 and PC.

The force feedback is powerful and responsive. Truly adds a whole new level of immersion to my racing experience that I had never felt before. Some have complained about the wheel being loud during operation, but I disagree there. Occasionally you'll hear the FFB motors clacking, but it is by no means disruptive.

The paddle shifters are solid metal and produce a satisfying click. Overall, I'd recommend the Logitech G29 to anyone looking to get in the racing wheel game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_75?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=75&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It didn't come with any documentation, only a graphical guide to wire hookup. Plugging it in, it would appear in the device manager but no drivers were ever found. On the Logitech site, no links to drivers were available. I finally found a 3rd party site with a link to the Logitech gaming software. Setting that up, unplugging the device, rebooting and plugging it back in finally resulted in the gaming software recognizing the wheel. A firmware update was performed, another reboot, and then it finally worked.
  Using it is great. I don't have any other devices for comparison, but this one definitely adds a level of realism to my F1 and Dirt games. Believe it or not, the main reason I purchased this is to get my kids some actual wheel time before they put the general public in jeopardy as drivers in a few years!

Logitech G920 Is Awesome","May 9, 2017","When a friend told me to purchase this item, I was kind of hesitant...it is a lot of money for a steering wheel and pedals. Connecting it all up to my computer was a piece of cake. I plugged it in...and Windows 10 did the rest. (no configuring) I couldn't wait to see what Forza Horizon 3 would be like...so I launched it and away I went. At first, the force feedback of the wheel was too intense for me, so I lowered it down to 20% and now I can't get away from the computer. I LOVE to drive the cars...so much more realistic and I can control them so much better. If you have any doubts on which wheel and pedals to buy...get this one...and disregard the comments about the pedals being too hard. (they are fine just the way they are) I may buy the stick shift eventually, but taking your hands off the wheel to shift could make you crash...for right now, the paddle shifters on the steering wheel is the easiest way to stay in control. <3","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_98?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=98&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After firmware updates and power cycling for a month this was never fixed. This is a known issue with this unit as I found out in a logitech reddit thread.

I should've gotten one sooner.

This new setup is fantastic. I have had it for 2 days now and decided to write this review. I have used it on Xbox one with Forza 5 and I give it a 4/5 on there. Why not 5/5? I don't think it was developed using console games and was dedicated to be a PC wheel with the option of console. I say this because I used the wheel on my PC today with PROJECT CARS and I am mind blown. Night and day difference between the console and PC in terms of performance therefore it gets a 5/5 when used with a PC.

Why? The steering feedback felt much more refined especially the turning (Forza maxes out where in Project Cars the wheel can be turned to full max and the simulator does the same). More accuracy to say the least. I'll try to compare with Forza 6 and report back if I have time.

Regarding the fit and finish (I also have the shifter assembly which is outstanding) it gets an A+. The feel of the wheel and shifter and pedals are very nice. Install way a breeze. (For PC you have to download the driver from Logitech website, Xbox is plug & play). The one thing that caught my attention is the hardness of the brake pedal. It is a bit tough but gives more feel to the experience of a real pedal but it is def. on the stiff side which I saw in other reviews as well. If you play without shoes for a extended period of time the bottom of your foot WILL hurt (ask me how I know) so in order for not to happen, shoes are recommended. Especially when not left foot braking.

In conclusion, I am very happy with my purchase. I have it mated to the Openwheeler Racing Wheel Stand Cockpit which is also superb given the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_125?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=125&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's absolutely incredible the difference this peripheral makes. Trying to play any racing/driving games with a controller had been my primary way of gaming, but this racing wheel made steering so much better. When I first started looking at getting a racing wheel, I went for a $100 mid-range one that I felt fit my budget better. However, I quickly learned that all racing wheels are definitely NOT created equal. Although this racing wheel is very expensive, it's been worth it to me. I'm impressed with the build quality, and it was a surprise to see that the wheel is wrapped in real leather too.

I really like the pedals as well. The base is heavy enough that it doesn't move when I'm moving my feet frantically accelerating & braking. On that note too, I don't quite understand the fault with the brake pedal? Other reviews that I've read on here have faulted it, but it feels pretty nice to me, and I'm able to brake pretty well with the games I'm playing.

Overall the quality of the device is excellent, performance has been great, and setup was easy. This racing wheel has made the racing experience so much better; It's the difference between night and day. If you're looking for a racing wheel, I highly recommend the G29. I love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_148?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=148&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Gonzalez-Dias","For the price  ($205) it's hard to beat.","November 6, 2019","Originally I had been set on buying the Thrustmaster t300 rs gt and while that also would have been a great wheel set (and more upgrade-able), it was nearly $100 more than the logitech. And for someone like myself who simply just wants to see what a force feedback wheel system can do for my in game excitement I didn't want to break the bank.

So in comes the G29 set.

It met most of my expectations except for the brake pedal. While I appreciate and I do like the non linear action, I feel that they could work on lessening the overall force required to press the brake pedal. With that, it makes it a little unwieldy if you have to use the setup without a proper wheel stand or cockpit.

You do also need to make sure to adjust your settings in the G Hub application because you may find that in certain games having 900 degrees of rotation is quite a bit too much, namely driving an F1 simulator.

As for the force feedback provided, I have to say it is a thrilling addition to a racing wheel and I do feel my money was well spent. The force of the feedback can be turned up to the point where I could hardly even turn the wheel on high speed corners. And I was able to reduce the feedback down to a point where I felt comfortable doing high speed and low speed corners without having to fight the wheel too much.

All in all, it did require a lot more setup than I had expected but when you realize how many adjustments can be made within the program as well as the game you're playing, you understand why it is necessary to make adjustments to suit your own abilities rather than have a one size fits all option.

If I was buying again though, knowing what I know now, I would probably spend the extra money on the Thrustmaster setup giving me the ability to upgrade to a proper F1 racing wheel replica. But that will be a future purchase I'm sure as I get more accustomed to racing sims with actual wheel and pedals.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Bad:
1) Mine has a screeching noise when I turn the wheel to the left, both when powered on and off, this is a high pitch and loud noise that is easily hearable even when speakers are at high levels - extremely annoying, I sent mine for a replacement, but Logitech's main and only distributor in Turkey just sent it back, after 3 weeks, doing absolutely nothing, probably the package was even unopened (the package was also damaged from their mis-handling), by infringing my rights as a customer, as there is a 14 days return period
2) The break pedal is just awful, you definitely need to open it up and remove the rubber, I bought a Playseat Challenge, the stiffness of the break could break the chair's connections
3) Once for unknown reasons the PC lost connection, I don't know whether it's a chronic issue

The Good
1) I only considered a Thrustmaster as people report the middle is a dead zone, but practically it's not true, on Dirt Rally the FFB worked as expected in the mid region too - tho the FFB is overall weak and boring, but don't take this as a comparison, as this is my first FFB wheel

Verdict: It's annoying, it's trouble, not only I wasted $700+ with everything involved but the Logitech here really messed with my nerves, if anyone from Logitech reads this, please consider dropping your relationship with ""Penta"" - they are making people hate Logitech products, as I read from online complaints, it's a widespread issue","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_152?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=152&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I would definitely look at getting a thrustmaster level quality or higher unless you're just looking for a cheap wheel to play with until it breaks and replace it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_146?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=146&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If your using it on xbox (PS4), then it's a plug and go setup. If you plug it into your PC, then you need to download Logitech's G software that's hidden on their website. This is my first wheel, so I was lost trying to dial in the right settings for my wheel. I used YouTube and Reddit to get an idea of what I wanted for each game (Forza 7 and F1 2019).

The pedals are a whole other beast. The throttle and clutch are nice, but the brakes are wild. There's a rubber stopper in the brake to make it extra stiff towards the end (non linear brakes). The problem is that the rubber stopper is to firm with little give. The amount of pressure needed to fully actuate the wheel results in my hole playseat challenge to shift. You can remedy the situation by voiding the warranty and removing the stopper, or replacing it with something with less resistance. Lucky there's a modding community for the Logitech G series of wheels and pedals. Another option is to adjust the brake dead zones in game. If you decide to adjust the brake deadzones you won't void your warranty, and will still benefit from progressive braking.

Overall I am pleased with my wheel and pedals. You definitely need to adjust the settings to your driving style and should consider get a wheel stand or Playseat Challenge. Altogether, my setup has brought my driving to a new level.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Logitech support is THE WORST. Ordered for our 15 year old son. He plays the Forza games and does well with the controller.  He struggled to get good when using the wheel. Then the xBox light began flashing. All the buttons and pedals worked but no steering. After trying to navigate the Logitech web site for twenty minutes to find one basic remedy. That did not work so I sent an email explaining what I had already done. It took five days to get a response telling me to do the basic reset I had already tried. There were five emails over ten days and was unable to get resolution.  I emailed Amazon about returning it. In three hours they had responded with resolution. Logitech should take a lesson from Amazon on how to take care of pying customers.

It might be that I needed to acclimate to the new controls, but the wheel felt laggy and I would end up oversteering all the time. It was no fun.

On Windows 10, it just doesn't work. I downloaded the latest LGS app from Logitech's site and straight away it fails to find the majority of my games on Steam. Logitech's solution is a convoluted set of instructions (outdated too, given the LGS interface had changed since) that result in me editing a Game profile and manually browsing to the game EXE buried in the Valve Steam directories. Not for your everyday consumer.

Even so, it still wouldn't work. LGS detects the wheel and paddles, and the wheel spins on plugging in -- to calibrate. And then nothing. The Crew, Dirt 3, Burnout Paradise...nothing.

Logitech's support forums are full of unanswered threads from people with problems, and their FAQ doesn't even acknowledge the issue.

I've tried updating all my drivers (I have IOBit Driver Booster), uninstalling GeForce Experience (F1 2016 suggestion), manually reinstalling the driver in Device Manager, plugging into different USB ports, unplugging and replugging from USB while outside the game, inside the game, etc.

Driving Force GT on the playstation and it was perfect. I was given this steering wheel as a ...","September 28, 2016","I owned the previous Driving Force GT on the playstation and it was perfect. I was given this steering wheel as a gift so I can't comment to the price. However, despite it being supposedly better built, I couldn't see much difference between this and my previous driving force GT. More importantly, the brake is very stiff, and I actually can't play on it anymore because I have been getting knee pain from it ( im only 28 and have never had this before, and its just knee pain in the left knee which I use to brake.) The other major problem is that thrustmaster seems to provide a lot more support to developers these days. Thats why for example on assetto corsa, theres a huge deadzone for this wheel, when reviews with other wheels didn't show a lot of problems.

Update: If you look up online, there is a small piece of rubber hinged in the brake pedal on the inside that you can remove to improve playability. The brake is still stiff afterwards however.  Bad move logitech. Most people are having to remove this eventually for their legs to survive and yet that would void their waranty. Really? Who came up with that decision instead of having a normal progressive force brakes or adjustable stiffness like other comparable competitors?
The wheel is great otherwise, good feel, good force feedback. The pedals are a huge issue though and should be a dealbraker for most.

All in all, I would go for the thrustmaster over this...

Update:
I stopped using this and my knees were back to normal and I could play basketball. Tried it again when GT sport came out and OH MY GOD. The pain is unbearable.

While the steering feel may be a step behind that of Turbo S in its stock form, users should be able to adjust it according to their taste using Logitech Gaming Software.

The one thing I would change is the optional shifter, as it is way too soft to be realistic; I often shift to 5th gear instead of 3rd because there is literally no resistance between gear shifts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_48?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=48&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The g27 was a huge success and has been known for it's reliability, I just hope that this one holds up as well.

Initial impression
Disclaimer: This is my first wheel so i don't really have anything to compare it to.

I am very Impressed by the quality of the wheel and the pedals. The wheel feels pretty solid, the leather feels real good (smells good too), and the click from the paddles is very satisfying. The peddles feel pretty good and in my opinion, not bad for something that cost $400. The brake peddle feels really good, but does take some getting use to when compared to how easily the other peddles press down.

If you have never used a racing wheel before, it def take some getting use to. I've used it now for a total of 4-5 hours and am finally starting to get a hang of things and have the settings to my liking. The force feedback does have a slight dead zone when the wheel is centered but nothing that has bothered me or is really noticeable unless you try to feel for it. I'd be interested to see how this wheel feels compared to a belt driven wheel.

Pros:
Quality product for the price
Rather quiet for all the vibration and force feedback
Brake peddle feel really nice!
Buttons on the wheel make it real easy to use
Peddles come with a clutch

Cons:
No adjustability on the peddles
Wires. I wish there where less wires, or at least slightly longer wires (I had to use a usb extension since my xbox sits in the corner)
Very bright LED light on the wheel face (placed a piece of take on top)
Wish it had the wheel dial from he G29

I'm sure ill find some other pros and cons the more time i put into using the wheel, So far i will say that i am satisfied.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_119?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=119&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The wheel spin smooth the pedals dress nicely I was disappointed when a button came non-working and time a button messed up in the spring when pressing.. It was resolved easily by sending mine to Logitech and they sent me a brand new not refurbished but brand new one and now works fine the one that I received from Logitech does have a slight squeak when turning the wheel very fast to the left but that's okay do not get the Xbox one unless you really need it for the Xbox and don't know of any good controllers to make it work with the PlayStation one the PlayStation one has multiple more buttons and controls than the Xbox One in overall is better it works with the PlayStation 3 4 and PC no problem I don't use it on the PlayStations I use it on my PC only I prefer it normally with American Truck Sim or with euro Truck Simulator 2 overall it works good drives amazing and it feels like a real car when you drive in

Unfortunately, after I booted up FORZA 6, the force feedback was very low. I tried various settings and different rotation settings but nothing would fix it. I also tried only signing in with the wheel to see if this would resolve the issue. I did not contact customer support, as I am very knowledgeable of how to use sim racing wheels. I currently own a logitech driving force GT that gave me better force feedback then this wheel ever delivered. I'm very very disappointed in logitech. I have to say the build quality on the petals and the wheel is excellent and the leather feels great in your hands, however this is not a wheel that you can be happy with because the force feedback is so weak and you don't get any feeling that you are driving a car. In my honest opinion, the force feedback feels more like an assisted steering rather then the motor holding the wheel back making it tougher to turn. At $400 I was expecting a lot more but I guess I will spend the extra $70 to get a thrustmaster wheel. It is at 11 AM right now and last night I received the wheel at 5 PM. I played for about two hours and try to get the settings to work for me but in the end I was disappointed. I think in the future logitech needs to release new drivers for the XboxONE that make the wheel more compatible. Logitech, I'm sorry but you won't be getting my business anymore. I thrive off sim racing games, and the fact that my wheel that is 6 years old performs better than a new wheel is unacceptable. I'm happy that I'm going to get a refund.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_102?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=102&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This is my first forced feedback wheel so i have no preferences on how good it feels compared to others. Metal pedals and paddle shifters. As most people will say the brake is very difficult to depress all the way to 100% because of the rubber piece they gave it to make it feel more of a progressive pressure feel, however if you adjust the deceleration deadzone down to ~35 and you'll be fine. I've also noticed if you have set the rotation to anything different, if you hit the home button it'll reset the setting back to 900° of rotation. Overall its a great wheel but...the biggest complaint i have (which seems to be a very common issue with the g920 and g29) is that when it turns left it produces a very high pitch squealing sound that can get annoying. It's a sound as if you can all of a suddenly hear dog whistles, so putting on a headset is a must if you don't wanna hear it.
(In the photo i bought the stand that is in the ""frequently bought together"", it's $189 for a stand...a little ridiculous for a stand if you ask me)

Decent shifter. I have never driven a manual car and i believe this is designed as a short throw shifter, so i have issues knowing if its in gear all the way because it's such a short throw. It doesn't really feel ""notchy"" enough when shifting as i would like. I have the g920 wheel so I'm unsure if there are any other shifters that work with wheel or not","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The T300rs steering wheel is beautiful, the pedal looks nice at first but then...
The pedal is very small, if you don't have a stand it will move everytime that you step on it, so annoying!
The forcefeedback is very stupid, it is very strong but it doesn't feel like driving a real car. The g29 is much more smooth giving you the right amount of force at the right time.

G29 pedals are amazing, very similar to the g27.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_125?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=125&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I truly want to get a Fanetic wheel, but they are a bit overpriced in my opinion and their sales are rare.  So, until I can get that, I grabbed this G29, which for all intents and purposes is essentially the same wheel.  It does kind of stink that Logitech and Sony couldn’t figure out how to make the G27 compatible as there are not really any differences.

For the price, this is a pretty decent quality wheel, although by no means it is at the level of Fanetic wheels.  It has a bit of toy-like look and feel with its mostly plastic components.  The leather racing wheel is good quality though, although a bit smaller than it probably should be.  I assume that is to compensate for its feedback motor.

The wheel’s force feedback mechanism is a bit noisy and feels a bit notchy and not as smooth as higher end wheels with its feedback.  The pedals are decent although it would be nice is if they had some feedback as wheel.  The shifter feels pretty mediocre as it looks like something that would break easily with rough shifting.  It does the job and is about what you would expect for a wheel in this price range though.  The plastic table clamps are to me one of its weakest links, as they at times don’t seem to hold well.  I am using a metal racing stand and they hold, but these could be better quality.

With that being said though, the wheel is pretty durable and has held up with use.  One thing that is on my wish list is wireless controls.  Granted maybe that is not possible, but it sure would be nice to not have to deal with cables for each of the components.  For some reason, Logitech still uses old style plugs for the wheel as well to connect to each other.

Of course, this wheels biggest weakness as compared to more expensive alternatives is that you cannot change wheels or add other components, meaning what you see is what you get.  For a starter wheel, this is a good way to go.

If you are looking for a high-end experience, then you will need to step up to much more expensive alternatives.

The pedals are super-heavy and secure even on my usually-slippery hardwood floor (and includes a flip-down set of spikes to dig into carpeting), the pedals generally have a good feel to them.

However... Logitech has some quality control issues with their gaming hardware. Brand new out of the box, the left paddle shifter has about a 30% success rate registering clicks - researching on the Internet, this seems to be a super-common and widespread problem of cables disconnecting internally or otherwise faulty switches. The gas pedal occasionally has issues reading correctly, the brake pedal consistently has issues reading correctly forcing me to set a deadzone in excess of 50% to work fully. For one of their higher-end products, I'm very disappointed in the quality of this product and the fact I have to RMA it already. That said, the promise this wheel has, I'll be giving them another shot (and buying an extended warranty...) in the hopes that my issues are just a fluke.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_67?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=67&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Stepping up to this is a SIGNIFICANT improvement.

I like the updated button layout, as I no longer need another controller handy. I also like the layout better. But most of all - it's SO much quieter while operating. It also feels smoother while turning. The center point is still a little ""No left feedback past this point, no right feedback past that point"", but it's forgivable, as it's also about 1/3 the price of the systems that might do more.

One cautionary word: there really is no repair service for these - they are very much ""buy and use until it breaks"", but with Logitech standing behind it if it breaks under warrantee. Once the warrantee is over, you can try to repair it yourself (which did not work on the G25) or just pick up a new one. It's sufficiently complex in there that an extended warrantee really would be justified.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_67?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=67&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I say this as an owner of the previous Logitech G27 Racing Wheel for over five years. From all indications the G920 is built to the same standards as the G27 (and the current G29 for the PS4) and I would expect the lifespan and reliability to be similar.

Since the G920 can also be used on a PC, I'll point out a few differences this new generation of wheel and the previous generation G27:
- The G920 costs more than the G27 and does not come with a shifter like the G27 does, instead it is a separate purchase.  I will say this isn't a big issue for me as I use the paddle shifters on the wheel almost exclusively.
- Though this can be used on both the XBox One and a PC, the button layout obviously lend itself to XBox One use.
- The brake pedal has been updated to more closely resemble how an actual car brake feels - the pedal moves much less and encounters increasing resistance as the pedal is pushed down. I like how the G920 succeeds in making the pedal feel a bit closer to a car's brake, but my son who races more than I do is not as impressed and prefers the G27 brake. In all, this is a case of ""different"" but not necessarily ""better"".

So I would call this a 5-star product for XBox One and a 4-star product for PC users - except I have to dock the G920 (along with Logitech's other wheels) for poor after-warranty support. Many parts on the G920, G29, and G27 are made of plastic and can break, and other parts (the potentiometers or ""pots"" in the pedal system in particular) will wear out over time. Logitech currently has *no* spare parts available for any of their gaming wheels including the G920.  If the wheel is still in warranty Logitech will apparently replace the entire wheel, but if you are out of warranty you will get no help whatsoever from Logitech. In my case I asked about a lost screw that attaches the G27 shifter to a table and about worn out pedal pots - in each case Logitech said there was nothing they could do. That might be tolerable for a cheap controller or mouse, but I do not consider a $400 racing wheel a throwaway product and I find this level of support unacceptable.

So overall a solid product and arguably the best wheel for the XBox One. I will enjoy this wheel as long as it remains trouble-free, but I know that after the warranty expires any support from Logitech is likely to be non-existent. Also note that the new generation of wheels (G920 and G29) has reduced the warranty from three years to two.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_150?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=150&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Lot's of great features and feedback system is fairly decent. My only complaints would be their gaming software will not detect the wheel no matter how many times I re-install the drivers and software (sigh) or any other number of troubleshooting steps I can find online. However the wheel works flawlessly in game so not a deal breaker. The other would be more of a personal preference and honestly applies to every wheel system out there. The peddles are too close together and the break peddle should be a horizontal pad like what we have in most vehicles. The experienced drivers instinct has the break and gas hard mapped in our subconscious so moving to the break from gas on gaming peddles easily results in hitting the gas and break both. With all the effort that has gone into making these systems come as close as possible to real driving; why not make the peddle layout/spacing more realistic or at least adjustable so we can decide for our selves? I guess it's more of a nice to have then a must have but damn it would be nice to not have to re-program my breaking reflexes :).","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The build quality of this wheel was outstanding, it had a very premium feel to it but infested with problems. The brake pedal was very stiff to the point where you were unable to stop (even after maxing out the brake sensitivity on games).

I use this for Gran Turismo Sport on the PS4. I previously had a Driving Force Pro from Logitec as well. I’ve played each iteration of Gran Turismo since the original Gran Turismo (it was not called GT1) and have used a wheel on that game starting w/ Gran Turismo 3 (a-spec) and have logged . . . about a billion miles.

I love this wheel dearly. I’ll talk about the pedals separately.

The operation is very smooth and it’s much quieter than my old DFP. Metal paddle shifters are wonderful; I’ll add a shifter once it’s supported in a GT game. There is a blue metal band on the top of the wheel making it easy to find center (for those of us who care about that) so it’s not a line of tape that will come loose or fade over time. For me it’s precise as all get out. After using a controller for the first few months I was ecstatic about how I could place my car around the track. But it won’t make anyone a championship driver . . . you’ll just have more precision.

There is a full complement of buttons on the wheel including (bottom to top)  a PS button, Options button and Share button below the center of the wheel. It may take some time to get used to; I’ve hit the share button while trying to pause the game during a practice session. That’s my only quibble. The rotary dial can be used  to select the level while the +/- button changes what setting you’re manipulating during a race; you can remap the wheels buttons in the options menu.

Getting my PS4 to recognize my wheel off the bat was easy . . . once I figured out just what to do. I leave my wheel plugged in, turn on the PS4 from the unit itself, then – once the blue screen comes up – press the PS button on the wheel. I mention this because initially I was using my controller to wake up the PS4 and it would take quite some time before the wheel could be used. I hope that helps anyone who’s run into the same issue.

NOW ABOUT THE PEDAL SETUP

I kept this separate because of all the reviews mentioning the pedals. The gas offers very little resistance in comparison to the brakes. The brakes may feel very stiff to others; I myself was somewhat prepared due to the reviews. Compared to my old DFP, the effort required to operate the brake pedal is gargantuan . . . but that’s not a problem. It feels much more like the brakes I’ve used in my (limited) time on the track. The brake has more resistance than the ones in my Buick, but I was able to get used to that. For me it has a much more sporting feel.

**UPDATE 7/29**
After some checking it appears the rubber inside the brake - which causes that resistance - is supposed to simulate a load cell. The brake has a certain amount of travel to a point, then you apply more pressure and modulate how much stopping power you get. It's a bit grabby to work with at first, but I REALLY REALLY love it now. Just took the better part of an afternoon to make it part of my routine. Trail braking is easier too. Back to the original review...
*******

In game I’ve noticed something. When using a controller, I have less braking power, but with the pedals – when I really stand on the brakes – the stopping ability is increased. I credit that to the game itself, recognizing what a driver can do with her/his feet vs. the amount of travel available w/ the triggers on the controller. It definitely took some getting used to but the amount of modulation I get from the gas AND the brakes has lowered my lap times tremendously.

Lastly, the price of this is awesome in comparison. A $700.00 wheel is not in my budget, and this is the one I’d decided to target. It came up on Prime Day and I snapped it up . . . but I’d planned on buying it eventually at the regular price. It’s smooth and quiet, precise and a great wheel. Worth every penny.

Now I just need a correct wheel stand! The X-Celerator(?) Big Boy stand I have worked for the DFP; the pedals on the G29 are way too big.

TL;DR:

Great wheel, Brake pedal takes effort to push but it’s worth it, HIGHLY recommended for price.

Hope this helps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I would be really angry if i had spent anything above $250 on this wheel. Everything was fine for the first two weeks.

I'm not sure what the cause of this is, but a quick google search shows this as a trending complaint.
So far all buttons are working.
Now for the second issue. A month ago I started noticing that the faux leather was making noise. Apparently, whatever adhesive is being used to adhere the faux leather to the wheel rim has worn off. It's like it has a bit of play in it. I don't want to twist the leather on the rim to make it worse, but sometimes that is unavoidable when doing quick corrections when driving. I hope it does not get to the point where wheel rim slips under the leather. Good thing i don't have Force Feedback maxed out!!

When the back end goes out (which it will due to what I mention below) the amount of maneuvering you have to do in the 900 degree steering range is crazy. Realistic, YES. Accessible to the casual / semi serious enthusiast? More than likely not. Be warned, your gameplay WILL suffer hard if you are coming to this from a controller. Will take some serious time investment.

- If you have a rolling chair with no carpeting underneath (and this is my personal problem with using this thing, again not docking for this) you WILL move backwards. There is real resistance to these pedals, mostly the brake. This is not a fault of the product, this is just reality. I think it is great that it is this way since it is a result of the product feeling VERY realistic.

- Brake pedal sensitivity (and I am docking a star for this one). No matter how much I tweak the settings in the Logitech companion software, I can NOT get to full brake lock without curling my toes around the pedal and JAMMING it to the stand. I am driving in Forza Horizon 4 with no ABS, and I simply CANNOT lock up the wheels. This is very frustrating for me, as it makes cornering more of a challenge than the new control scheme already is.

- No Vibration Feedback: I can understand in hindsight why a wheel clamped to a desk wouldn't have rumble. However, that is hindsight. I have serious trouble keeping the back end in control when I don't get the rumble feedback I am used to in my XBOX controller. The dual-motor force feedback usually isn't doing much until the car is in full-tilt oversteer. This makes driving rather tricky. This is lending itself to the lost star - but on it's own doesn't warrant that since Rumble was not an advertised feature. You know what happens when you assume!

OTHER GRIPES (these lend to the one lost star):

- ABXY (and PS equivalent) are a bit of a reach for my thumb, and I have large hands. I find myself frequently pressing B (or the ""cancel"" equivalent on PS) when reaching for the A (or ""accept) equivalent on PS) button.

- The mounting clamps semi-frequently experience a sort of slight release under heavy steering input (at least when mounted to a standard desktop) and it makes an incredibly frightening POP noise, however continues to work normally with no damage. The mounting knobs just pop up out of their ""locked"" position when this happens.

- At a $400 USD price point, I would have hoped the paddle shifters were column-mounted. However they are not, they are wheel-mounted. This makes for some guesswork if changing gear mid-corner. This is big for me, as I am accustomed to changing gears when preparing to exit a corner.

TL:DR: Some minor frustrations, but many are a fault of my setup. A couple ergonomic issues, but for experienced players or those with a knack for reprogramming muscle-memory, not a huge issue. Would advise a demo at any sort of shop that stocks these if possible, before buying. If I had done this I likely wouldn't have purchased.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I purchased the G29 + Shifter and a new open wheeler chair. I wish I just accepted G27 dead for the PS 4 and did this sooner, I absolutely love this rig. I know it is not perfect.. none of them are even if you spent thousands.. which you easily can.. I think wheel is phenomenal, solid and great bang for the buck... the new halleffect sensors are well worth it in my humble opinion, no dust issues like optical s found in G27. I will say shifter pattern is a little hard to hit 3rd gear and a little plasticy feeling (that can be fixed) and although rubber damper on brake spring is a great improvement, I will be installing my GTEYE spring set when warranty runs out. There are better rigs and there are worse, but for me I loved my G27 and feel this is a worthy albeit pricey successor. If it is as dependable as my G27 I will be very happy, so far so good. I might look into a club sport 1.5 shiftier as an alternative to Driving force unit in future.

Ferguson","Evolution of the G27; brake pedal now very stiff.","November 24, 2015","Logitech's marketing for the G920 and the G29 (Playstation) suggests a thorough redesign of the company's earlier force feedback steering wheels, notably the popular G27. The G920 (MSRP 399.99) is best viewed as an evolution of the workhorse G27, and once past the addition of the D-pad/XYAB controls and compatibility with Xbox One, the units share many mechanical features. This is especially true in the pedal unit, which as best I can tell, is largely the G27 unit with a Nixim style mod, that is, a small block of rubber inserted into the spring coil to increase pedal resistance. For my taste, I think the brake is not sufficiently progressive; it goes hard very fast. I haven't opened up the spring mechanism yet, but I will revisit this review when I do and let you know whether there are any quick fixes. It is a certainty that there will be 3rd party mod kits for the pedals just as there were for the G27. So far, the outer pedal mechanism appears nearly identical to the G27. On the steering wheel there is the obvious addition of the controller functions. This is great for set-up, but in general I don't like a lot of stuff on my steering wheel (real or simulated) so I'm actually nostalgic for the spartan G27. The G920 loses the LED rev indicator that is present on the G29 and G27. The paddle shifters are similar to the G27. The leather stitched wheel feels good, and you have 900 degrees of turn and a race-car style flat bottom geometry. On the force feedback, Logitech says they've done loads of design and testing. I think the unit will feel familiar to G27 users. It is very smooth and quiet. I am disappointed by the removal of the shift unit from the package, but that's the way things are going generally. On the whole, think of this as an evolved G27 with a stiff brake pedal and Xbox One compatibility.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_154?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=154&reviewerType=all_reviews"

That said, I'm holding a grudge against Logitech for not coming up with a solution to the PS4 compatibility issue with the older Driving Force GT wheel. People have come up with complicated DIY hacks to make the old wheels function on PS4 (which is a little over my head) so it's obviously possible. So what I'm left with is two completely worthless Driving Force GT wheels. This new wheel is great, but offers nothing to me that the old one doesn't.

I had the wheel for maybe a week and sent it back for a refund.  The wheel is functional but not anywhere near the level I thought it would be.  The force feedback is awful and I set it on zero after awhile.  In Forza 6 with all assists off and steering set to simulation or normal, once your cars' rear wheel lose traction, there is no way to correct without overcorrecting.  You also cannot quickly whip your car around with throttle steer, the cars just understeer and go straight.  Plug your controller back in and you can drift and throttle steer no problem.  And believe me, I went through and manipulated every setting configuration possible.

On PC for American Truck Simulator, things were a little better but after the first two days on my brand new gaming PC, the system wouldn't even recognize that the wheel was connected.  I deleted and reinstalled drivers and software but no luck.  And when it intermittently connected, the force feedback, although set to zero, was so stiff, you couldn't even budge the wheel from center.

Hopefully I will find out.","July 23, 2018","So far, not happy. Has not worked since it arrived. Device manager refuses to see it, even after a complete format of my HD. All troubleshooting from Logitech and internet research has failed. So how did it get 2 stars? Well, it's still semi-recognized by the system. I just can't adjust the settings outside of games, or use the profiler, which is a big problem with this wheel if you are a sim racer. So, I have had driving experience with it, just without full features or capabilities. I've been sim racing since the old Indy 500 Papyrus put out. For the last 8 years, I've had the Logitech DFGT. This G29 is so much smoother and you can feel quite a bit more. The real prize here is the pedals, however. One pedal, to be exact. The brake pedal compared to the one that comes with the DFGT isn't even close. The throw could be a bit better but the feel is vastly improved, giving much better control. It was so different that it took a bit to adjust my driving and get it right. My lap times immediately improved, setting personal records right off the bat. So, while I do think this would probably get 4 or 5 stars, it's yet to be fully functional for me, so as it stands, it's a 2. Will update after working with seller to resolve this problem.

Edit: Update--- Still does not work properly even with a replacement. Logitech keeps trying to close my case even though they have resolved nothing. I have a replacement wheel and they want to go through this entire process again. It seems that they have no answer. Do NOT buy this. May work properly. May not. But customer service has been crap. Once again, I got this in July. It's now late October. I still have no solutions to my problems. I will not work with this company again, and I stress, it has been work. My pain through dealing with this wheel's issues has been much more hassle than it is worth. Do not buy a Logitech device. Ever! I never will again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_106?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=106&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've used it for F1 2016 only, but plan on using it for iRacing in the future.  MUCH quieter than the DFGT.  There is a dead spot in the middle that is larger than it should be, so that's not ideal.

I've had the cheap console ones before with the shifter that only goes up and down, and those have not been cutting it for me.

Managed to get this wheel bundled with the shifter during one of the sales, and so far, I've been pretty satisfied with this wheel. One thing I noticed with my cheaper wheels was that I always had issues with oversteer and spinning out. This wheel wasn't much different in that regard. When I first jumped on Forza with my 600hp S14 Silvia, I kept spinning out, and couldn't drift like I could with a controller. I do think that this might just be something to get acquainted to as when I went to a slower car, I didn't spin out nearly as much and eventually got better at it.

In terms of the quality of the materials, they don't seem too bad. I will say though that my wheel already had a tiny bit of peeled color on the middle blue strip on top of the wheel. Not a big deal to me, but for someone more anal about aesthetics, this is something to note. Maybe it's just a defect on mine, but it makes me question the durability of the middle strip. The outer part of the wheel seems durable so far. At first I thought the stitching was slightly frayed, but it turns out that they just left the ends sticking out a bit. So far, it seems like this wheel should last a while. But it isn't a big deal if it doesn't as you can easily swap the wheel with real car wheels using adapters that you can find online.

The pedals I have no complaints about at all. I'm completely satisfied with the pedals.

The shifter I felt was a bit light. I was able to swap shift knobs easily by getting an adapter/taping the shaft so a normal shift knob would fit. With my heavier metal shift knob, I like how it feels more. For me, getting into reverse is a bit finicky as I sometimes don't push down enough and the game doesn't register it as reverse.

But overall, I'm pretty happy with this bundle. If you're able to get the bundle when its on sale, it is definitely a great value and I'd recommend it if you want to get into sim racing or just want a wheel with a full manual setup.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Many folks comment about the brake pedal mod, and, honestly, yes, you need to do this, but its simple and there are many videos on YouTube.  The brake pedal damper is way to heavy.  Cut down the rubber stopper to your liking and you're good to go.

Forces in the wheel are generally lag free and realistic (depending on the game, and your preferences).  Control is crisp and accurate in all axis'.  Build quality is surprisingly good, easily the sturdiest controller I've owned in 30 years of buying this stuff.

I purchased the G920 because the pedals specifically got good reviews for quality, so I wouldn't need to purchase an upgraded set of pedals. The reviews were accurate. The pedals are not excellent, but good enough for intermediate drivers, I think.

Remember, this is a USB-connect wheel and pedal set, so don't assume you'll be able to connect it to your Xbox wirelessly. But the upside is that you can use it with other USB connect platforms.

Pros:
1. Responsive wheel and realistic force feedback.
2. Good production quality.
3. Mounts to my Playseat well, and is very stable.
4. The tightening knobs for the mount push down out of the way after tightening to the Playseat deck or your desk/table.
5. Very reliable, and it has not given me any problems after months of almost-daily use. I leave the wheel settings in their default positions and tune car performance in Forza's ""Tune"" menu. Maybe not the right way to do it, but works for me.

Cons:
1. The adjustment range of the clamps that secure the wheel to your desk/table is not sufficient to accommodate a thicker table top. It needs another inch or so of travel.
2. The thumb toggle on the left of the control pad section sometimes refuses to move to the right without carefully pressing it just the right way. It works but is finicky.
3, there is no headset hookup on the wheel, so you need to attach a headset to your console. You can connect a handheld controller and the G920 simultaneously and connect the headset to the controller, for online chat; but it's a little bit of pain in the a$$ to do it that way and it will ""time out"" and cut sound, so you need to keep it ""alive"" by touching it frequently.

All in all, from the view of a ""non-expert"" user, this seems to be a competent and reliable wheel & pedal set at an affordable price point, and performs as advertised. I wish it had a headset hookup.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_87?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=87&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When it came in, I used it for about 10 minutes and it's been in the closet with the winter coats and boots since. The only reason that I hate using it is the brake. You almost have to stand up out of your chair and STAND ON IT to get it to work. The brake tension is set about 5x higher than it should be. Until they fix that, this is a complete waste of money, unless of course, you play Nascar games, where you just step on the gas and turn left for five hours.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

In any case, I was disappointed that the shifter was a separate clamp on mechanism from the wheel as it took too much space for my set up. And the paddles seemed cheap being made of stainless steel in my opinion. Also, the USB cable that connects to the console was too short for me although an extender cable worked well.

On carpet, the foot pedals didn't slide as the flip anti-skid worked well.

Like the g25 did for me years ago, this wheel transforms Forza into a whole new experience. It feels like a brand new game.

The force feedback is strong and accurate. I actually ended up building a solid platform to properly use the wheel, as anything not solidly built would simply move too much. The inputs from the wheel are immediate, and make you feel like youre in the car. The only downside (and its a matter of taste) lies in the pedals. Specifically, the brake pedal. If feels way too stiff, but with time you get used to it. So im not deducting a star because of this.

That can kill a great race in hurry as it pauses the race in Project Cars (great game by the way) at the most annoying moments. After a quick Google search, I found loads of people in the Logitech forums having the same issue caused by a design flaw in the wiring harness that connects all the buttons in the wheel to the base.

Please read the posts in the following link to the logitech forum before making this purchase: [...]. This is page 3 of the thread in which someone actually took the wheel apart to discover the problem.

My next step is to contact Amazon for a return, but not an exchange unless they can assure me that Logitech has implemented a design change that will rectify the issue. If no change has been made, it's Thrustmaster for me. I will say though, for the 3 hours it worked, I have no complaints.

But when the G29 works, it's great.

In late November, I purchased a G27, which came defective (the wheel would align itself to about 10 degrees off center). I attempted to replace it through amazon but they were out of stock, so I went to Logitech. Unfortunately, Logitech's customer support takes at least 2 business days to respond to any message, so the process of confirming that I needed a replacement took about a week. Following that, Logitech said they would send me a shipping label and then did not contact me for about 2 weeks. At that point, I called support and they told me they were waiting for supply of G27s (which they don't make anymore...) Eventually, they decided to replace my wheel with a G29 and sent me a shipping label. This whole process took about a month.

A couple weeks later (this is now mid-January), the G29 came in, and it was a blast for a about 2 weeks, at which point this wheel also broke. This time, the issue is a faulty connection in the wheel which can either cause it to get stuck calibrating when plugged in, or cause the buttons to be unresponsive (or all activated) at many positions on the wheel. This is a common issue you can find in other reviews and forum posts. I have just contacted Logitech again, but for 2 and a half months of wheel ownership I have had a functional one for less than 2 weeks, and I expect to not have a functional wheel again for another month.

*EDIT* The wheel is coming tomorrow so I was spot on with the 1 month replacement period. Hopefully I get what I paid for this time.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_149?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=149&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Take the time to calibrate it and you'll be happy.","November 10, 2017","Overall, solid racing setup.  It starts as a good setup that with some modifications and calibrations make it a great setup.  If you're not sure if racing is your thing, get this.  It's one of the cheapest full setups you'll find for the money and won't totally break the bank.  I for one will probably upgrade, but this bridges the gap nicely.

The Wheel - Very good quality materials, paddle shifters responsive and sturdy, decent force feedback.  Since I use this for Project Cars 2, I applied the almost mandatory Jack Spade profile, which made the FF excellent.  Others have stated this saved the game for them.

The pedals - Sturdy, somewhat heavy plastic base, good quality pedals with a good throw... except...the brake pedal.  At first I thought it was broken, but then did some research.  Logitech was trying to emulate a real brake pedal which has more resistance.  I just did a recalibrate on it and it does indeed feel more realistic.  I give light pressure for normal braking, and if I need to slam the brakes and lock up the wheels, I have to put some leg into it.  I like that.  People it's not hard, there is calibration and there are mods.  Luckily, I didn't need to mod it.

Shifter - Not too impressed, however I cannot beat Logitech up too bad, as this only cost 60 bones. It has an okay quality.  It is very loose between the grooves and I frequently miss gears because of this.  There is a relatively cheap mod to fix this as well.  It also does not have a sequential mode like other shifters.  There is a way to make this happen too, but it involves rubber bands and such.  I will most likely sell this and get a shifter with both modes with better materials.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Usb disconnects every couple of minutes, seems to be a fairly common problem. I'll get one from a better manufacturer, personally I think logitech is garbage these days. Tech support was just going to send a new one but I don't feel like waiting weeks for them to get off their butts and do it.

Update
So I opted for a replacement wheel instead. I returned the broken one for a refund. This one works, so I'll bump it up to 3 stars. The problem with finding a decent wheel these days is they all seem to have issues. The thrustmaster ones feel great, but most fail in a year or two and have to be repaired. Logitech if you can find one that works seem to hold up longer from what I've read.

Reconnecting the USB does restore Force/Vibrate, but still irritating as often as it happens... With all that aside, this wheel is excellent for racing games. The feedback feels great, and doesn't seem to feel under or over powering. The built in clamps are disappointing, small jaw opening, loose and wobbly. The pleather wheel feels great, paddles are nicely stamped steel, high quality xbox controller buttons. The pedals are ok. Gas pedal is ok and not wildly sensitive, Clutch is a simple pedal with just a slight resistance, clutch engagement ranges can be adjusted allowing you to use personalize where you like the clutch throw. The break pedal is good, but make sure you have the pedals against a wall or something very heavy so you don't push them away. I disagree with the people who say the break pedal is too hard, and removing the rubber resistance as some are saying, is not a good idea, it feels good enough. However a hydraulic break pedal would have felt most accurate, and weigh the pedals down just right... So, that brings me to the price. It is very much over priced, I would rate it at 180-200usd maximum. For the price I payed, I was more expecting professional simulation hardware, more fabrics and metals, and higher quality parts,  but it is mostly a cool glorified xbox controller. Don't let my slightly negative review stop you from considering this, Its Awesome, and a Necessity if You Enjoy Driving games.
Edit: Month later, its getting quite irritating that there has not been one day where the wheel hasn't crashed my game. I wish I knew what it was like to exit my game instead of crash to desktop.... Logitech doesn't appear to even have the ambition to improve or fix this. I guess I payed $500 for fancy looking piece of s***.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_86?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=86&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I do not and will not speculate about the ""security chip"" claim that Logitech has and continues to make. I am reviewing this wheel, to the best of my ability, as a standalone product.

--------------------
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:
--------------------
Years ago when I wrote my original review for my DFGT I was beaming with happiness; GT5 Prologue had been released (the taste of car-crack that I had grown up with on PS1 and PS2) and my decision to buy the DFGT was validated the very first lap. I felt a lot of that same happiness when I fired up Driveclub (yes, Driveclub) and the G29. This is a beautiful, well-made piece of gaming goodness.

Since I do not own (but have used) the G27 I'm going to compare the G29 more to my DFGT. So to start...

►Build Quality:
From the moment I unboxed the G29 I loved the quality of the materials and how it came together. You're getting a real leather wrapped wheel, high-quality metal pedals and flappy-paddles shifters. Extensive use of plastics are found on the G29 no doubt but again the key is high-quality plastics.

►Force Feedback & Turn Radius:
I tinkered around with the force feedback setting in Driveclub until I found something that felt good. I'll say that out of the box the configuration is pretty good. However, going from using my DS4 to a full-on racing wheel was a huge gameplay shift so I spent quite a bit of time sliding around the track. The force feedback felt a bit too strong so I dialed it down. One of the things I distinctly remember loving about the FF is the connection it helps the player make with whatever racing game you're playing. That is still very much true with the G29; I immediately felt connected to the road as I drove my M3 and then later Pagani Zonda around Canada, India and various other in-game locations. You feel the road shift, bumps, rumble strips and run-out areas... it's pretty amazing and totally immersive.

The steering wheel also features a full 900° turning radius. It's important to note that because not all racing wheels do and you can sometimes find yourself running into the limitations of the hardware when playing a game.

►Pedals:
The pedals with the G29 are excellent. You're getting real metal pedals here not plastics like with my DFGT. Each pedal has a different amount of pressure required to press the pedal down. The brake distinctly feels like a brake and not like the clutch or accelerator. I will say that I haven't purchased the optional shifter (yes, optional) so my experience with the clutch was pretty limited. I do intend on buying the shifter I just haven't done so yet. So I'll update my review then.

--------------------
PRODUCT USE:
--------------------
I'll keep this a bit shorter since I mentioned using the G29 with Driveclub. I will say again that I really do love almost all of the G29. The steering is tight, force feedback is excellent and strong - so much so that I turned the setting down; the pedals are realistic and responsive. If you've never slurged and purchased a driving wheel you simply cannot go wrong with the G29. This is almost the complete package...

I will say I have two areas of disappointment with this wheel:

1) You have to purchase the shifter separately for the cost of a new PS4 game. Ouch.

2) The flappy paddle gearbox (to borrow a favorite term from Top Gear) is not good. Let me describe it this way - it's ""squishy"". Each paddle shifter has to be squeezed toward the driver and it feels like I'm squishing a stress ball inside the G29 assembly. My own car has paddle shifters and they're so much more better; crisp and responsive with a satisfying ""click"". Not so much here. Yes, this paddles will have to do if you don't intend on getting the shifter but they're not great.

--------------------
THE GOOD:
--------------------
(+) Materials. From a real leather wrapped steering wheel to metal pedals and paddle shifters Logitech did a nice job bringing the G29 together into a premium racing wheel.

(+) Force Feedback. I love the power behind the force feedback motor and even had to dial it down in Driveclub.

(+) Shift Indicator. Just like your favorite supercar or F1 this wheel features LED indicator lights right on the steering wheel. It's a little gimmicky but cool!

(+) Button Arrangement. I love that the L2/R2 and L3/R3 buttons are light blue and a good contrast to the rest of the wheel making them easier to find.

(+) PS4 Buttons. The 'Options' & 'Share' buttons are easy to find as is the 'PS' button. Great for quick in-game snaps.

(+) Quick Setting. The G29 retains some of the DFGTs button layout including the quick setting buttons and radial toggle.

--------------------
THE BAD:
--------------------
(+) Shifter. I have to mention it... the G29 is as much as the PS4 and you still have to buy the shifter separately! That stings!

(+) Paddle Shifters. Channeling Jeremy Clarkson here... the flappy paddles aren't great. It feels like I'm squeezing fruit when shifting. I really wish these were more satisfying to use.

--------------------
CLOSING:
--------------------
All in all I cannot wait to use the G29 on more games. I've avoided buying Project Cars up to this point because of mixed reviews but will probably jump over after I'm bored with Driveclub. For now the G29 and Driveclub is my gaming nirvana. Aside from a few downsides as mentioned this is a fantastic product and easily one I recommend!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_152?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=152&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Logitech G920 seems robust and works perfectly in my PC with Forza 7 and Need for Speed (after installing Logitech software).  Playing with this wheel and pedals is another world. I was playing using my keyboard only and I could not play these games for more than 10min... was very disappointing. Now with the G920 I can spend hours as it is so fun and realistic. I will buy a special chair or even those systems that includes the chair and wheel/pedal support.  The Logitech G920 is really a nice upgrade for your car gaming with very good overall quality.  I will test now in my Xbox One.

I love both.

Recently I encountered a problem and contacted them.  Their service was terrific.  After an initial on-line warranty form, they contacted me with some suggested solutions.  When these did not work I called them and always had a very helpful person to talk to.  They quickly OK'd my issue under warranty and shipped me a new wheel.  I could not have been happier.  Their service was 180 degrees from the ""service"" my friend received on his Thrustmaster pedals which he is still trying to solve.

Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm a huge fan of driving/racing games and I was stoked for the opportunity to review this product.  So let's get to it.  (I've also never used a G27, so I won't compare that iteration to this one.  Instead, I'll focus solely on the G29).

Firstly, this is a spectacular looking wheel.  It looks like it belongs in a real luxury car.  It's that good.  The presentation and build are both top notch.  Aside from the slightly smaller size, it passes as a legit wheel.  I absolutely love it and I'm completely enamored with it.  The pedals, too, feel like real peddles.  They have excellent spring.  The only change I would maybe consider would be to spread out the pedals a bit more, if it were possible.  But that's really a preference rather than a complaint.

Setting it up was relatively simply on PC.  I had to download the software from the Logitech website.  The software allows you to set up profiles for individual games, or use existing profiles for your games.  I found the set up is user-friendly and easy to navigate.

I was quite surprised that the shifter is sold separately.  If you want a shifter, plan on adding another $60 to cost, which at $400 is already quite hefty.  The wheel and shifter cost more than the cost of a new PS4.  Looking at it that way, it does seem overpriced;  but I don't know the costs of R&D and production.

It does rather feel like a luxury at this price point, but if you can afford it, go for it by all means (especially if you don't already own a G27).","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_153?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=153&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sightler","Durable, high-quality wheel","February 13, 2016","At the time that I purchased this, it was significantly less expensive than the TX 458 Leather edition. I think that pricing fits perfectly. The leather wrapped wheel is of a high quality and the pedals are excellent as well. I find that the break pedal provides excellent feedback, and while it is heavy I think this adds to the game rather than detracting from it. A little calibration can make it marginally less heavy if desired as well and it is easy to get the level of braking force that you want.

The steering itself is excellent, and the driving motors are relatively quiet. The feel is slightly notchy due to the gearing and it does have a slight issue with poor on-center feel. In practice, I have found neither of these issues to be significant to me. Also, the wheel can produce quite a bit of force when turned up all of the way. I don't think a higher level of feedback is needed at all.

Overall, it is an excellent product. Everything about it feels well made and durable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_69?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=69&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Tested for PC.","November 21, 2017","Only buy if you are expecting to have to download modifications for it to work completely for pc or have googled the games you play thoroughly in terms of compatibility to see the fine print of what works and doesn't work. For such an expensive wheel, the compatibility out the box is very poor. Some of the listed games on the logitech website work very well, such as Forza, but trying it with Grid or Dirt required far too much software mods to get it to work. Spending time on Google showed some people had different experiences. From my experience, the wheel turns off its force feedback as well depending on the game if it is incompatible, then you have to keep replugging it back in to get the feedback back on.  Some games if not most, the shifter is completely useless and will not work no matter what I try. Also the shift lights are compatible with almost no games without installing a third party program that also didn't seem to work for me, but at that point I was super impatient with all the downloading/googling I had to do. It's just the price point is too high to have this little support. Could buy something better and don't think this wheel is worth the high price.

Unfortunately Logitech was a bit late to the gaming console party with a wheel so I popped for a Thrustmaster TX Racing Wheel when they first came out which is great now because I really can compare the two.

The Good;
The wheel force feedback feels great!!! The one thing I noticed immediately is how much lighter of a feel there is between the Thrustmaster TX vs the Logitech G920 and for me this is a good thing!!!  The Thrustmaster steering always felt heavy to me, I know this is just a user experience thing but I genuinely felt it slowed my steering reaction times. So if you liked the way a G25 or G27 felt, then you will feel right at home again!

The Bad;
Yes, just like any other reviewer of this product, the brake pedal stiffness is ridiculous! I will give it some time and see if it softens up or I will end up with a Popeye calf muscle!

The Ugly;
Whose dumb idea was it to put a bright white LED that shines in your face!!???? I guess nobody at Logitech plays games in the dark!!??

Of note;
I really miss the thumb accessible buttons the G25 & G27 had, the only button my thumb can really reach is the “B” Button, the “LSB” and “RSB” buttons are really positioned to low. Although I give high praise to Logitech for black letters and symbols on a white button!!!
Wheel still mounts up perfectly to a PlaySeat Evolution perfectly…thank you Logitech!
Unfortunately there is NO left right adjustment on the foot pedals , not that there was with the G25 or G27 but I have been spoiled by the Thrustmaster T3PA pedals which have multiple mounting holes in the pedals","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_121?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=121&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It does it's startup routine to find the center point of the wheel but it's unresponsive when I try to play any game. It doesn't always happen and when it does I just have to keep unplugging it and plugging it back in until it works. Even when it does work though sometimes it doesn't seem to know what straight is. I  won't touch the wheel at all and yet the car/boat will turn one way or the other. It seems to correct itself after a minute or two but it's still a little annoying.

With that being said, I cannot compare this product to others.

PROS:
-Solid construction
-Good quality without the $600 price tag of their competitors
-Responsive wheel, turns easily and fluid
-Force Feedback is fantastic - can decrease and increase within most game settings.
-3-pedal system - brake, accelerator, clutch.
-Wheel is comfortable to grip - doesn't slip in hands.
-Easy to set-up (I'm using Windows 10 64-bit)
-Easy to add on the Logitech G Driving Force H-Shifter (just plug 'n play, then map the keys to the game)

CONS:
-Brake Pedal - way too hard to *fully* depress.  Even when placed against a wall, my chair wants to tip over to get to 100% braking.  The pedal gets to 80-90% easily without tipping me over in my chair (lol).  Regardless, it doesn't effect my games as my vehicles still come to a complete stop.
-Pedal base needs something for hardwood/vinyl flooring.  Rubber pads, even suction cups, would help.  As it is now, it's designed to be played on carpeted flooring.  Not a major issue though.
-Even though it's not as pricey as others, $300 remains to be a lot of money, but worth it if you enjoy driving/racing/trucking simulators.

Overall Verdict:  If you can afford it, get it!  I was thoroughly satisfied","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_37?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=37&reviewerType=all_reviews"

All the other reviewers are absolutely correct regarding the brake pedal. This wheel is impossible to use with Forza 6 until you remove the rubber stop inside the brake pedal spring. This is not a difficult task. If you are comfortable using basic tools like a screw driver and have the patience to ""mod"" your brand new wheel, you can remove the rubber stop and the pedals then work brilliantly. Other commenters have said that the LED light on the wheel is very bright, which it is. Play in a lit room and that's not a big deal. Also, don't look at the wheel while driving. I personally think that the USB cable that connects the wheel to the Xbox is too short. I had to use a USB extension cable to reach my Xbox. I bought the shortest Amazon Basics one that would work to avoid introducing delays in the controller's response time in the game and it seems to work fine.

I also own the Mad Catz® Pro Racing™ Force Feedback Wheel and Pedals for Xbox One® which I love. In comparing the two, the MadCatz wheel is better for casual gamers who want a realistic experience. One of the mount options for the MadCatz wheel also you to use it right on your last without a stand. The Logitech wheel REQUIRES a stand. The Logitech wheel has a larger dead zone for the force feedback so the MadCatz wheel feels more responsive. The MadCatz wheel also comes with pedals that work correctly right out of the box and have adjustable springs so that you can create a brake pedal feel that works best for you. The Logitech pedals come with a clutch pedal, which is a big plus for pro drivers, but the minimal adjustability of the Logitech pedals makes them feel less pro than the MadCatz ones.

The perfect wheel for me would come with the adjustability of the MadCatz wheel and include the missing clutch pedal. I'd like the ability to adjust the dead zone for the force feedback to match my dead zone for the wheel input in-game. I don't think any wheel should require the purchase of a stand.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_55?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=55&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Logitech sent me a replacement. Within two weeks the pedals failed - pressing the throttle pedal was also actuating the brake.

Under warranty, Logitech sent me a third wheel, which after about six months developed the problem the first wheel had.

The wheel itself is great though I must say that Logitech really screws you over with this wheel regarding software functionality.

The wheel itself works great; has good force feedback and functionality. The brake pedal, however, is ridiculous; they put a black rubber piece inside of the pedal and it's horrible to deal with. I couldn't even push the pedal all the way down at full force; even people I know who have been wrenching and working on cars/trucks for years as mechanics had the same issue with the brake pedal. Removing it still leaves the brake pedal as the most difficult pedal to press but is much easier to use and not as frustrating. I honestly think putting the rubber piece in the brake pedal was a poor design choice.

My biggest complaint with the wheel though is the software made for it. Logitech ditched the Logitech Profiler for the Logitech Gaming Software for use with the G920/G29 and it's horrendous. You have no versatility with the software; getting it to work with games that aren't designed with the wheel in mind is a hit or miss and the only things you can change are the DOR and the center spring strength (not to mention combining pedals for certain games). The software is cheap and a horrible alternative to the Profiler, which they should've just updated and kept with the G920.

If you are looking for a PC Gaming wheel, this wheel is a massive disappointment and you should look to the G27 instead. The G27 has the same functionality but comes with the Logitech Profiler which is far superior to the crappy Gaming Software the G29/G920 has. All in all, great wheel functionality and design aside from the brake pedal, but extremely bad software support for PC Gaming.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Then after reading, I saw that it was mostly people crying about the old wheel not being compatible with PS4.  Well that sucks, but it's no reflection on this wheel, and for the record it's Sony that didn't make the PS4 compatible.  The G27 may physically never be compatible and Logitech would never be able to anticipate what to expect in the PS4...Anyway, end soapbox.

I got the wheel last night, set it up, and tried it out with Project Cars.  What a difference right out of the box!  I haven't needed to change any settings (although the headlight and wiper buttons don't work...probably a minor setting change).  I recently tried a $75K simulator setup and the steering feel on this unit is just as good.  The pedal feel might even be better...  Good quality materials and a solid feel.  Mine is mounted to a Wheel Stand Pro.  Both products are well worth the money and are a great combo.

I’m 2 months into this purchase and after a few F1 2018 grand prix there is a rattle inside the wheel and no buttons are working. Wheel was very much babied but it appears to be a poor design. The force feedback causes the wheel to shake violently and I don’t believe the design and manufacturing is high quality.

Trying to start a warranty claim with Logitech and the their warranty site times out on me. Will continue to push and see if I can get it completed. Overall very dissatisfied with this purchase.

Once you get the FFB dialed in on whatever sim you're using, this wheel feels great. Brake pedal is very difficult to get to 100, but you just need to calibrate/set deadzones accordingly. Pedal spacing is very good for heel-toe. Flappy paddles work fine, but I'd recommend the H-shifter addon for more fun depending on your sim and cars.

The wheel feels like it's driving for you... You're just trying to hold the wheel and it literally yanks itself out of your hands unless you're holding it like a gun.(This must be what they mean by ""feedback"" driving..)
No one needs feed back from million dollar super cars; Do you have any idea how violent going from 0-60 in 1.5 - 2seconds is with feedback?
The simple act of going 0-60 in just a few seconds is enough for the feedback to literally spin you out, and when it feels like the game is fighting you like this it feels like you have no power steering BUT with a super car instead of your car irl. It just feels awful
And the idea that i'm doing something wrong when i'm perfectly capable of playing my second favorite genre along side fighting games with fighting sticks.. rediculous

It was better than this. The wheel is OK, don't get me wrong. But the buttons, what did I just hit. Oh, over and over again. I just want to pause the game but I end up at PS Menu or share, lol. The brake, if my car was like this I'd take it in and tell them its broke, lol. The tech these days has really went into the crapper. Who tests this stuff and says yeah, I like that. Have they even used a brake in a car? The other buttons seem farther away from the edge of the wheel than the G27. I need fingers that are about 2 inches longer so when I'm racing I can depress them. I'm tired of this crap. I should give it 3 stars cause that would be fair. But since I get screwed having to buy a shifter separately and I'm not as satisfied as their older version. screw that, it gets one. Extra 60 bucks deducts 2 stars, I think thats fair for a Fisher Price QA department. I'm tired of this cheap overpriced crap everybody keeps putting out. I must be getting old or something.

My i7 7700k with watercooling heats up a ton after about an hour using this. Take this into consideration. Also the force feedback improves with the framerate so make sure VSYNC is off on all your games you use this with.

 Feels scarily realistic. The only thing I can recommend is buying an adapter and a full size steering wheel for true immersion since the wheel is 270mm and a real wheel is closer to 350mm. Brakes are stiff but are actually really good. See the pedal becomes very stiff after some travel and if you've ever tried to push the brakes ALL the way in your car you know the feeling. The first bit of travel is great if you are using a car with no ABS since it's about how hard you can press without locking up the brakes. Clutch is fairly light and throttle a little heavier but both are smooth and satisfying. If you have wide feet I recommend using this set with just socks. You'll have better throttle control anyway. Strongly recommend getting the shifter as well. If you don't know how to drive a manual you can learn/teach others with this set. Short of getting a simulation chamber with G-force emulation this is pretty good. Looks kinda goofy with all the buttons but they are a lifesaver in games with tons of bindings and the dial is good if you have a race car that has a turbo/supercharger you can adjust on the fly. If you love racing irl this is a great gift to yourself. I actually drive on the track even more quickly and safer now that I can practice all I want with this little rig for the cost of a hotter room. Recommend games like Assetto Corsa, Gran Turismo, Beamng, Euro Truck Sim. TONS of aftermarket upgrades too if you want to throw more money at your rig.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Never have been.  I'd gotten an earlier version of Forza for the Xbox 360 out of curiosity, and my son enjoyed it a bit, but neither of us really got into it, being into first person shooters instead on the consoles...

But in April I grabbed an Oculus Rift, and of course one of the things I ultimately had to try was a racing game, and it really turned it into a different experience. Enough that I decided I needed to try a wheel and pedals to control it, not just the Xbox controller.  So I did some digging, and this was the one that seemed to hit the right price point and was supported in the Project Cars game I have on the Oculus system.

Setting up couldn't be much easier - I was clamping it to my PC stand (https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BBKNI6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and that actually worked quite well, but I did end up just ordering an actual racing wheel stand this evening to improve the experience.  The only thing I would've wanted them to change is to have some kind of plate or bar on the bottom to help hold all the cables in place as you're getting things set up.  There are small channels underneath this, where they run, so they're recessed and this sits flat on the surface you're clamping it to.  But I had issues with a short cable getting pulled out the first time I was setting things up.  Having something that slid over that to help keep them in place would've been nice.  But it's a minor annoyance, wasn't even worth dropping a star.

So once you get things plugged into this, you can connect it to power, but don't plug into the PC until you've installed the software, which will then prompt you to connect the USB cable.  I did this on Windows 10, and had no issues.

There was a firmware update right away, so I ran that as well.  Then it was time to play.

Project Cars in the Oculus had support for this, so that's what I tried first, and then realized that this is apparently a game that reverses the pedals by default, so I had to go into the options and remap all three pedals to get it to work.  But once I did that, I was quite blown away by the experience.

Having never used a racing wheel before, I didn't expect the force holding the wheel in place.  I expected force feedback as things happened, but I didn't realize how firmly this wheel was going to hold the center position.  But it's awesome since it really helps keep you stable.

Most of the video reviews and such talked about how it takes time to convert from a controller to a wheel, and that you can expect to ""relearn"" since it's a whole different experience.  I didn't have that issue, since my racing sim gaming was so minimal.  I took to it quite quickly, and inside of about three or four races, I had a good feel for it, and my performance soared compared to the hand held controller.

Many people complain about the bright light on the wheel above the Xbox button.  For me, not an issue since I have a headset on for the VR system, but I can see how that would be annoying if you're using monitors.  Nothing a bit of tape wouldn't solve, but I think the least they could have done is had an option in the software settings to turn the light off altogether.

Button placement is alright, I wish they had been a little closer to the wheel's edges to make it easier to hit, but they're not hard to get at as they are, just not quite as ergonomic as I would've hoped.

Unit is pretty quiet as well.

I see a lot of people complain about the brake pedal being stiff, and it certainly is, compared to the others, but for me it isn't an issue.  I may not know enough about these though to have the ""right feel"" for how it SHOULD be, and that may be why it doesn't bother me.  But as a total racing sim tyro, it's not causing me any issues at all.

For me, this really became a ""Wow, I'm sure glad I got this!"" kind of an item the first day I had it.  With the VR headset, this really completes the immersion.  And when it's on this desk I'm using right now, and I""m on the bench in front of the setup, my hands are EXACTLY where they show up in the Oculus, so the illusion is complete for me.

Feels great, love the resistance in turns since that really helps me keep on track and not spin out as much, and while the price seems steep to me, I didn't have many options considering I'm on a Windows 10 PC and may use it on the Xbox One as well at some point.  But while the price was steep, I'm looking at it as one of those, ""You get what you pay for"" things.  It completes the illusion of actually racing, and that made the price point less of an issue for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_123?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=123&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Cauthen","A serviceable and reliable wheel with a promising refinement path","October 14, 2015","I picked up the Logitech G920, primarily for use with the XBox One and Forza 6, and Project CARS and iRacing on the PC.  So far it's doing a serviceable job with all three, but at the outset, it's not as refined as I would expect a next generation force-feedback steering wheel to be.  The force-feedback effects feel mostly one-dimensional to me, with the emphasis being on self-centering forces.  There's also a considerably significant force-feedback ""deadzone"" when the wheel is centered, even with Forza 6's inside dead zone set to ""0"", making the driving feel a bit sloppy.  I didn't expect optimum performance out of the box, as it's pretty clear that Turn 10 has as much of a hand in the way this wheel performs in Froza 6 as Logitech.  It will improve over time, hopefully to at least the level of performance I was seeing with my Fanatec GT2 on Forza 4, and the XBox 360.  Presently though, I can still turn in better times with the wheel than I can with the controller, while holding better lines in multiplayer racing, so that alone is worth the price of admission.

My biggest concern for this wheel was its helical gear drive.  I thought the potential for noisy gear operation might go beyond my tolerance level, after seeing and hearing some videos of the Mad Catz FF wheel in operation.  Much to my delight, I can't hear the helical gears in operation.  There is a ""gritty"" feel that I can associate to them, but it feels a lot like the steering in my Mazda Protege.  It's not an annoyance, but clearly not as smooth as the belt drive operation of my Fanatec GT2.

The process of pairing this wheel to my XBox One required more gyrations than Logitech's recommended process, which is quite busy on its own.  Once I got the two paired, it's not been a problem.  You can use another controller to enable chat via the headset plugged into it, but there's not miniplug on the wheel to accommodate the headset.

The G920 turns in equally pedestrian performances with iRacing and Project CARS on the PC, but at least both games are presently playable.  I have not yet plugged Jack Spade's latest force-feedback package into Project CARS, which reportedly will help with that. I'll report back and revise my review once I've had a chance to do so... installing that package is not an easy task though.

The pedals that come with the G920 are so-so.  The brake pedal has a built in damper that stiffens up too quickly, IMO.  The workaround is to shorten up the travel of the brake pedal in the tuning setup, but then you reduce the resolution and fine control of the brake pressure when doing so.  I wish there was a way to adjust the backpressure of the damper to your tastes, but alas, there is not.

The connecting cable for the pedals needs some strain relief.  It exits the pedal base without any sort of pigtail to reinforce it.  On a racing cockpit or stand that puts the pedal base at an angle, this cable is subjected to undue stress that could easily lead to a broken conductor, or two within.  I put a stress release loop in my cord and taped the cable to the base with electrical tape at an angle to keep the stress relief loop in place.

Overall, the G920 has a quality feel of construction.  The leather stitched wheel feels great there's no slop in the wheel operation.  It also seems to run cool.  The force-feedback force is probably less than what most belt driven force feedback wheels typically deliver.  I think it will feel better once more feedback forces are modeled by the games and the wheel's profiler.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_146?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=146&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The feel is great and the paddle shifters have a nice solid click every time. Only two complaints is that the feedback can be obnoxiously loud sometimes, like on gravel in Dirt Rally or running over some rough curbs. The sound is a rough clanking noise and if you're not bothered by sound, then it shouldn't deter you form getting it. The second is that the brake pedal can be a bit hard to press down completely. With a stand, I don't think it would be a problem but without a stand (which is my case) it can be a little annoying.

Rowley","Questionable value for money; sub-par driving performance","September 6, 2016","(Comparing to a Thrustmaster F430 Wheel, playing on Forza 6)

WHEEL
Compact base with hard-mounting holes. Desk-clamping system is much simpler than Thrustmaster's, but is entirely plastic. Seems strong, but may not last forever. The metal wheel body feels nice, with large metal paddles. Some of the buttons are tight, others are loose. Similar quality to the Thrustmaster. Wheel rim is stitched in leather, but I wouldn't consider this an upgrade. The stitching is thick and ugly, and some of the leather is not even tucked away properly, leaving rough edges. It is actually quite smooth, so I would definitely recommend wearing gloves if you take your driving seriously.

PEDALS
Love having a clutch pedal. The base is quite large, metal pedal faces feel good. The brake pedal is VERY stiff: you have to stand on it to depress all the way. All of the pedals experience a lot of play under compression: it seems like the hinges are left deliberately loose for some reason? Didn't affect feel or stability, but a bit concerning.

EXPERIENCE
The brake pedal takes a lot of getting used to. Most of the resistance seems to come from a rubber stop, which has the disadvantage of lacking feel. The harder you stand on the pedal, the harder it is to tell how much force you are applying. I dialed back the deadzone to create a shorter pedal, but now your pedal release is much more aggressive and upsets car balance. I feel bad complaining about this since a real racecar has a stiff pedal, but the execution here feels unsatisfying.

The wheel force is quite weak, even compared to the old Thrustmaster. Heavy impacts just don't feel heavy. Full-lock slides don't pull your arms back to center. The center-deadzone is much wider than the Thrustmaster's. Contrary to other reviews, I did not find any noise problems with the wheel: the sound of the accelerator pedal against the pedal base is louder. There seems to be some sort of calibration issue, too: the wheel controlled the Xbox, but Xbox would not show the device under Controller Settings.

OVERALL
Well, after about 6-10 hours of use, I returned the wheel. Switching back to a controller immediately feels lame, but my laptimes are consistently 2-3 seconds SLOWER with the wheel. Even at a sale price of $240, the poor force feedback and spongy brake pedal are poor issues. At full price, this seems like a rip-off.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_108?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=108&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Wheel overall feels good, great sturdy build. The Force feedback is very strong and accurate Depending on the game your playing. Project Cars was in my experience the only time i noticed any Force feedback Dead zone about a Mm or 2 (very small), thats to be expected with a gear driven wheel tho. Also it can get loud, you will hear chatter and popping on higher FFB settings. If noise is a issue 4 you then you should look into a belt driven wheel. Can be pretty quite on lower settings also though. The pedals are Grade A Love them the brake mod feels perfect After it gets broke in. Only Problom is a Big one.  ALOT of These G29s are Defective They Stop working Randomly, and the wheel makes a bad ringing sound when turning, i had 2 get a replacement for Mine squeaking very badly. Amazon sent a new one and ive had it 4 days and it started squeaking even louder than the 1st one, for $400 this thing should be perfect and when working properly it is very awesome and fun. Its just a toss up on if you get a good unit with no issues. I am going 2 get another replacement, but untill then i cant recommend this at all. Unless u have prime and get a deal. //UPDATE// May 25 17 - after my third wheel and 200+ hours on it heres my conclusion,
/PROS/
-Great Force Feedback
-Little to no deadzone (on higher FFB settings )
-18 remapable buttons
-quality Build | Leather and Metal
-Can be Hard Mounted
-Compatable with Almost all Racing games on PS4
-pedals are heavy duty and can handle punishment
//CONS//
-Shifter sold separate 60$
-Shifter has a Very Short Throw (about 2in from 3rd to 4th) and feels kinda toy like
-Can get pretty Loud on higher FFB settings (Alot of Rattle )
-Gear Driven motors (reskin of G27)
-Brake Mod Requires breaking in, Very Stiff at first
- Had to get 3 Replacements Due to loud Ringing in Wheel","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you ever race in an arcade this wheel seems way better than those imo, and with the H shifter (if you got that too)  is so much fun. My only gripe is that I wish they had analog sticks to help you navigate the games, I don't even mean good analog sticks, just PSVita or PSP type sticks would do just fine, but you have to connect a play station controller if you want to use sticks, anything else in the game is fine. Analog is never usually required in racing games, but sometimes they have things like designing a car which has mechanics that use sticks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have been using it on a PS4 and Project:CARS.

First, let's talk feedback.  This thing is SPOT. ON.  If you're serious about next-level racing sim, buy this wheel, buy a projector, and get ready to trick your brain.  Seriously.  Five minutes in and you'll have sweaty palms.  You'll find yourself talking to yourself and the car.  You'll palm the wheel in controlled drifts and bite the corner of your lip.  It's intense.  The feedback is just absolutely balanced and incredible.  Little nuances in the track get accurately translated to your hands.  The rumble strips feel perfect.  Dip the tire off track or spin out and the car behaves exactly as you'd expect.  It's honestly surreal.

When you grab the wheel, prepare for battle.  The motors are powerful and at speed, you WILL have to fight this thing just like a real car.  The lock-to-lock rotation is spot on as well.  You'll spin it around fast when you enter a hairpin a little too hot and you'll battle it through when you ultimately spin out.  Because this thing means war, you really need to be sure to mount it to something secure.  My ""traditional"" setup has been one of those coffee tables that you can pull the top open and toward you.  That's not enough for this guy and it will shake the table top.  Plus, those little nuances I mentioned before?  They'll get lost in translation without a durable stand.  I'd STRONGLY recommend getting a specific wheel stand or racing chair.  A bit to that end, we haven't discussed the pedals yet!

The brakes have great progressive resistance and I was absolutely amazed how far these things have come.  The pressure is manageable and you can really manipulate the pedals to keep them where you need them to accurately control the car.  The same goes with the throttle.  It's a TAD on the light side compared to an actual gas pedal, but it doesn't feel wrong or fake.  Finally, to help keep these grounded, Logitech has built in a spike strip you can deploy that bites into the carpet.  Because these pedals are a bit ""stiff"", I still managed to move them around on carpet, but they stay reasonably in place.

Finally, this is all wrapped up in a high-quality package.  The leather-wrapped wheel feels outstanding and the face and paddle shifters gladly show off their metal build.  The pedals are high-quality metal with rubber grips so this thing's here to stay.  That said, Logitech made some other interesting build choices in my opinion.

Given the power of these force feedback motors, I was a bit disappointed to see that the clamps are both small and plastic.  I DID figure out that they come with pads you can slip off -- so pay attention there -- but it feels like these may break at some point given the force they constantly endure.  Outside of the plastic clamps, there are some additional curiosities to consider.

First, the wheel is still not 'actual size'.  Given, it seems like actual-sized wheels are now a thing of the past but it's the size of all other gaming wheels.  Call me a purist I guess but I don't understand why.  So much attention to detail went into this thing and the second you grab it, you know it just doesn't feel like a car.  This, truly, was my biggest disappointment.  Secondly, this comes with a clutch pedal and no shifter.  To get the shifter, you need to throw down ANOTHER $150 (!!!).  I personally am a fan of paddle shifters anyway, but why not include the pedal with the shifter to get it out of the way?  Finally, the shift light.  I was genuinely excited about this feature but the wheel is so tiny and the LEDs are mounted so low (on the hub, not the wheel itself), that you don't ever really notice them.

In all, this wheel's high performance absolutely eclipses its flaws.  The only negatives are more annoyances than compromises and anyone serious about racing games needs this in your life.  Expensive?  Yes.  But it's money very well spent in my opinion.

UPDATE 1: I have become so obsessed with using this wheel that I have built it a full-on racing seat setup. In doing so, I noticed that both the pedals and wheel have bolt holes so you can legitimately get this thing mounted. Do this and thank me later.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_152?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=152&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sidewinder Precision? Check. Multiple Thrustmaster wheels? Check. The list goes on, but the point here, is that the G920 is probably the most ""real"" steering wheel and pedal combo I've felt outside of an arcade.

The wheel and shift paddles are arguably higher quality than what came with some cars I've owned in the past, though I wouldn't have minded if Logitech had gone all out and made the wheel a bit larger. It still has the small ""this is a game"" geometry to it, and while the metal paddles feel right, the loud clickers are additional reminders if you're looking for a really immersive sim experience.

I was really impressed by how smooth and relatively quiet the force feedback is. It gives some decent fight when you're cornering hard, but at times, I felt like it offered a bit too much travel. Not so much that it was distracting, but I felt like there was too much similarity between the feel across different cars in Forza.

The pedals are especially nice. The travel and resistance is excellent, and the weight keeps them from slipping around very much -- though I'd strongly recommend a stand to keep everything secure. Again, though, they're just small enough and just tight enough together to keep them from being perfect.

At first, I was mildly disappointed that the shifter is a buy-up, but when I really started using this and felt the quality of the components, it really does justify the higher price, relative to other wheel and pedal combos.

It's not perfect, but it's awfully good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_153?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=153&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you are on a PC this is completely unnecessary, go into the calibration settings and adjust the axis to something that is comfortable for you.

Once that is out of the way, the rest of the setup is pretty fantastic given the price point. The force feedback is decent and the wheel and pedals feel precise. I wish the shifter had a little more feel but considering what it costs I'm not going to complain about that much. I have a lot more fun playing racing games with this than a controller.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_148?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=148&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I had no idea the difference it would make. I hoped it would improve the experience of my driving simulators, but couldn’t imagine that it would transform them the way it has.

Within a couple minutes of driving American Truck Simulator, a friend said, “Obviously this is a special kind of chair, too.”  It was just a regular office chair, but the force feedback of this wheel is so well done that my brain is fooled into thinking I’m moving. In my setup the wheel is placed directly in from of a 40 inch screen, which adds to the illusion that I’m looking out a windshield. Still, I never got motion sickness playing with a gamepad even when playing directly in front of the screen.  After about 25 hours with the g920, I’m still often slightly disoriented when I brake, and my inner ear disagrees with my mind’s assertion that I’m decelerating.

It’s hard to overstate how much more control you have with the g920 instead of a controller. Not only is it more precise, but it gives you realistic feedback that helps you learn and make decisions. In Assetto Corsa I feel myself skidding or fishtailing before I see it, and even when spinning out of control, the tugging of the wheel helps me understand the forces on the tires, and how best to right myself.

I should add that the shifter is absolutely worth the extra money. With it, the third pedal functions just like a real clutch.  Driving a stick shift is fun, and also gives the driver more tactile information about the speed and handling of the vehicle. Like the wheel and pedals, the shifter inceases immersion and makes it easier to stay in control.

If like me you have them on a hard floor, you’ll need the pedals braced against something - for me the wall. The clamps on the wheel and gear shift work very well. Construction is solid and attractive. I would like a hat switch, thumb stick, or mouse within reach of my fingers for looking around in game, but it’s well worth occasionally having to take my right hand off the wheel to look with my mouse, in order to experience everything else this device offers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/product-reviews/B00Z0UWV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"
