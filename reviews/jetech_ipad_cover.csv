Fit and Finnish is nice, has similar feel to apple cover, does not add much bulk. I did manage to get a small crack by one corner, but its minor and simply cosmetic. Don't know how it happened as I'm fairly careful with the iPad, but I don't overly baby the thing either. Anyhow, for around $10.. fits the bill and then some.

It has just enough of a magnet to keep the screen cover in place.  I really like the satin feel cover.  The only negative might be that it only gives two angle options when using the stand feature.

Of course it's not an Apple case but, if you like cheap cases, this is great one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_90?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=90&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I had just replaced my IPad screen due to a clumsy accident on my part, and doing so was already a painful process. Since I shattered the plastic on my cheap older case, I decided, “Hey, you know what, I should get a new case while I’m at it.” So when searching around online, I saw this case and decided, based off reviews, that this would be a good replacement. Boy was I wrong. I slapped the new case on and thought, “Okay, Maybe not as functional as my old case, but still pretty good.” The folds on the cover seemed kind of useless to me, but I didn’t necessarily know what they were for so I wasn’t going to judge. Then I began to notice that my iPad started acting weird. I already saw a few glitches from the screen change, nothing I couldn’t handle, so I chalked the newer glitches up to the same thing. Basically, my iPad seemed to turn off at random now which was a big bummer. Fortunately, it didn’t always do this, so I just kind of rolled with it for a few days. Then one morning I sat down and realized that the CASE was the one randomly shutting my iPad off. It has some sort of magnet embedded in the cover, so when the cover is folded back it will mess with the on/off button on the iPad. Of course I was really annoyed, since I payed money for a simple case that was hardly protective and very much a nuisance. I decided I would go back to my slightly broken, but functional case instead. Little did I realize this case practically refuses to be removed once snapped on. I had to pry the thing away from my iPad as best I could, causing my screen, which had been set for over a week, to pop off at the corner. At that point I was fuming. Now only did this case only cause functional problems, but it has now broken my new screen which, as I said before, was a pain to install. When I finally got the iPad out of this horrid case, I tried using my screen which was now, to my dismay, unresponsive to my touch. Not only was this case horribly designed and a complete waste of money, but it now will cost me further down the line. 0/5 Stars","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The quality wasn't great, so I returned it and used the money to buy this case ($11.99) and the Fintie case ($10.99). These are the two most popular cases on Amazon, and I couldnt tell based on reviews and pictures which one is better. Now that I have them both.....I'm glad I have both! These cases are both great for being so cheap. Once one case wears out I will pop in the the other one and hardly notice a difference. Both cases are light and sleek, but I will point out the highlights of each case to help people that only want to purchase one

JETech:
-Smooth confortable shell back that adds Very little thickness to the iPad
-Sturdy but flexible cover that holds up very well in both typing positions
-a tiny bit thinner when compared to Fintie case, but barely noticeable when side to side

Note: the cover sticks out a little farther than the actual iPad. Some people might get bugged by this, but I dont think it is a problem and if anything adds more cushion when dropped

Fintie case:
-Plastic railing over the speaker at bottom of iPad for extra protection
-More of a leather look that gives the cheap case a more classy look

Overall, I really like both cases. Instead of buying an Apple case for $80, I feel confident with either case that I saved a bunch of money but im still protecting my iPad well. I will update if one of the cases starts to fall apart or not perform as expected, but I'm pleased with both purchases. hopes this helps people like me that spend way too much time researching cases","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I have had it for a few months and always though it was odd that I could press down on the bottom corners of my iPad and it seemed to move.  I recently looked at the bottom corners and the case doesn't fit my iPad Air the way it should.  The bottom corners have cracks in them, because the hard plastic that covers the back of the iPad is clearly too small.  It doesn't snap into place at all.

After a week of use, however, the very thin piece that surrounds the sleep button at the top of the iPad has cracked all the way through.

The case came in two days and fit the iPad Air perfectly with no problems. The smart cover functions perfectly, and the iPad seems much better protected that it was with Apple's smart cover only.

The case appears to be well made and durable, with openings cut in exactly the right place for camera, earphones, and speakers. Hopefully it will last longer than Apple's smart cover (which wore out in less than a year due to cover splitting and separating from magnets).

Before opening the plastic, it looked like I was receiving a new version of the case I was retiring. When I put my iPad into the JETech case it was clear that the ""look"" was the only similarity. It is made a cheap feeling plastic. The cover does not fold back easily and the magnet was not strong enough to hold the cover at an angle for reading. I returned it immediately.

Cracks on the back.","January 14, 2016","This product fit quite nicely and served me pretty well, for about 6 weeks. After that, the back progressively started to crack for no apparent reason. It has developed cracks along three out of four of the corners, Granted, one of the times was when I dropped it on the corner which was my own fault, but the other cracks were not in response to droppage, they just sort of appeared on their own. Also, there is a very thin piece of plastic that goes around one of the buttons that just broke off on its own.
Once the corners develop cracks, the case won't fit nicely on the ipad, and it's likely to slip right out of the case on its own.
On the positive side; the magnetic closure works really well, and it offers both front and back protection.
I have yet to find a slim plastic back case for the ipad that does not crack. I understand that they have thick rubbery/silicone type cases that are literally uncrackable, but that adds so much bulk and heft to the ipad that it sort of defeats the purpose. So, I may have to repurchase an uncracked case.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've used my iPad Air pretty regularly on a daily basis for games and internet use. I don't however take it out of the house except when traveling for the weekend. The case has held up great. I've gone through two authentic Apple cases (from their website and then exchanged in store) on an iPad 2 that didn't completely fell apart (1st tore at the seam, 2nd the covering basically came loose). This cover is still in great shape. Magnets still work like they did since day 1. There is a slight gap at the corners of the top when the cover is closed. But after almost two years of use I'm extremely happy. I only came here to review because I'm looking for a new case for that iPad 2 that I gave to my family.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Both colors are a little less neon in person than they show as online, which I liked, but double check my picture before you order to make sure that's what you want!

Low cost and usability.
I have not been disappointed. It also looks good.
It fits well on the iPad Air and the front flap works well as a stand. The magnet is also something I wasn't expecting, but now appreciate.
The only negative I'd point out is how thin it feels. I don't think it would protect against a car rolling over it, but I do think it performs well in every day use.
I'm very pleased with this purchase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_133?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=133&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It’s been less than 3 months and there appears to be a crack at the corner where the camera is. I haven’t dropped the iPad or anything. I just started to notice that the crack was there one day. Also the magnet doesn’t seem to be very strong. Within the first month, the magnet had deteriorated to the point where it doesn’t even stay magnetized to the back of the case anymore. All in all, the case last pretty well for the first couple of weeks, but the magnet doesn’t seem to be anywhere as strong as the original Apple Smart Case.

It definitely won't protect your iPad past avoiding scratches on the back and screen, but it's great if you're careful with your stuff and are keeping it in your bag when it's not in use. I'm giving it 2 stars because I got the model for the iPad Air and it fits the product, but the camera opening covers half the camera. I didn't see reviews warning about this. I might have just gotten a defective one, but be warned. We also ordered a cover for an iPad 2 which fit perfectly. So I'm not sure what happened with the iPad Air model.
--------
Update: I got an email from them saying that they would send me a replacement for free, which is really nice. I already returned it, got the refund, and ordered a different case though.

It won't fit a iPad Air 2. I've had this case for a few days now and I like it, snaps easily into place, and it's super thin that matches the expensive Apple cases which are no longer available for sale. I'm giving it a 4 star rating instead of 5 for the moment, because it looks nice and so far has worked well, but the top foldable layer's edges are I think die cut and are super sharp. I had to use a rag and a tiny bit of water to wear them down a bit so they don't cut into my skin when I hold it, otherwise so far a good product for the price.

Update - 11.7.17
I've upgraded from 4 to 5 stars based on the 11 months I've had the case. The case is in perfect working order with no issues and I use it on a daily basis. I've had zero issues or quality issues with the case since purchase. Great buy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It looks just like the official apple sleep wake case and acts like it, almost.

There is a slight delay when closing the case on the iPad as it takes a moment to put the iPad to sleep. No complaints about it, just making note of it for those people who care. I don't care, it does its job correctly.

The only thing that's weird about it, is how you have to fold up the cover to get it to stand it a bit challenging at first, but after a bunch of times of doing it, you remember how. I do want to note, that a few times it did fall over after propping it up.

For the price, its solid, I would tell a buddy to buy it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's not perfect, but it's a very strong value. The overall feel of the case is firm, solid, durable. More so than you'd expect for $10. My cutouts were all perfect, including the camera. It's very easy to get your ipad into the case, but removing it was a bit of a task. If you plan to leave the ipad in the case, that's not an issue, but I only want to use the case when I take the ipad places, which isn't often. Otherwise, one of the big appeals of the Air for me is it's light weight, and I don't want any weight added to it.

Regarding the weight, I have a postal scale and was able to weigh it.

iPad Air 1 alone: 459 grams
iPad Air 1 with this case: 640 grams
case alone: 181 grams

weight increase with case: +39.4%

5 stars overall for being a great value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_108?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=108&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After using this case for 6 months, the bottom corners broke off.  Since the corners are what hold the Ipad in place, this makes the case non-functional.  More and more pieces of the case have broken off. I reviewed the seller's description and it indicates that it has a lifetime warranty.  So, I contacted the seller who has ignored my email.  This makes the item significantly not as described!  Thus I've reduced my stars to 1.  Obviously the seller uses the lifetime warranty point to make sales with absolutely no intention of living up to his obligations.  I will be contacting Amazon to see if they can help since the seller won't.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Definitely a different material though. However, this case is pretty difficult, for me, to take out (easy to put in though). Also, the front cover is litterally held by a patch in the inside (behind the ipad) that is like 2 1/2 index fingers long. If that patch comes out, it probably might break off soon. The iPad case (not cover) feels like a cheap plastic. Really thin but it does feel good.

Pros-
1)Super lightweight
2)Smooth material
3)Much cheaper than the iPad smart case from Apple when they look nearly identical.
4)Maybe it's just me but my case rarely gets dirty/greasy.
5)Don't have to clean the inside/outside/cover often, practically never.
6)Case aligns perfectly (imo) with the buttons except for the microphone (little hole on the top center, right of outside power button/little above camera).
7)Super slim/thin and not som bulky rock like case.
8)Good for price range.

Cons-
1)If its like a ""dust dirt"" on the case, it's visible.
2)Water/syrups/other liquids are also visible, especially on the inside of the cover part (like a fuzzy but flat/non fluffy blanket or some sort of material).
3)Feels cheap, especially the case part. Probably can snap it with ease.
4)Sometimes it feels like the folds in the cover part might break.
5)Incredibly difficult to put iPad in and out, for me.
6)Not that protective of drops, liquids and other damages but can't expect that for the price I got it for ($12.99).","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The texture doesn't feel like like it is absorbing the oils off my fingers like the first one and I have better hopes for this one. I will see how long this cover lasts and let you guys know if anything else happens. After seeing how nice their customer service was, I would recommend this cover to those of you guys looking for a cheap, nice cover for your iPad. I do like how sleek and classic it looks, but it does easily get smudges so just make sure to clean it often to maintain the nice appearance.

UPDATE 1: A portion of the back cover just randomly broke apart. it is the thin portion of the back cover that is near the volume control buttons. I'm not even sure how this happened since I didn't drop it or anything. I will ask their customer service about this and keep you guys updated.

I tell you what though, this was a good buy, 100%. My old ( official apple one ) - The smart case, had dried milk on it ( it's mostly for my son, and he's 2 1/2 ), and we didn't know. We were on the plane one day and smelled something absolutely so hedious, it was his ipad cover / case. The cover of the official apple one is almost like a felt or so, so when something spills on it, the little "" micro hairs "" can absorb. Needless to say, it was bad in our case. I assumed this would be the same, but it's not. In fact, the back is a slick plastic, and very very sturdy feeling. The front is made out of what I would describe to be "" close to the same material as the apple watch bands "". It's a good product, all holes are covered up, etc. I'd purchase again, and I recommend 100%.

This case has the same "" smart "" capabilities as the official apple one. When I close the lid the ipad comes on, and turns off as expected.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Looked at all the reviews and prices on various cases. Decided on this case. It came the same day as my IPad. Snapped it on and it worked. It is similar to an Apple case that I have on my old IPad except this one protects the bottom of the IPad and also provides some friction so it doesn't slide off the table. All buttons and holes are easily available and the case seems well made. There was some plastic smell when unpackaged but that is gone. Some reviewers seem to nitpick their way through their reviews on this case and others. I guess I'm not as fussy.

Problem is breakage - the fine cutout around the volume/side switches broke off within a month. I snipped off the remainder and sanded down the edges and that was good enough to continue. Then, the hinged corner on the Home button side just broke clean off. But for $12 or so, I ordered another one (they come with a 60-day NQA replacement, but I was past that). And... lo and behold, the small cutout broke off again! So I'd say if you don't plan any heavy travel or knockabouts, this might work for you - hard to argue with the price. But two of them had parts breaking off within a few months of purchase.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This is not a high quality cover for my ipad.  But for the price I did not expect one. It fits well and provides excellent protection for the screen. That was my main reason for purchasing this product.  I fully expect that it will not last as long as the ipad, but while it does it will functon well.  The cover (that folds over the screen) is a a somewhat lightweight padded plastic with a matte finish.  It has a nice feel to it and is not slippery to the hand.  Easy to hold on to.  The back side is a more stiff and heavier plastic like material which will provide adequate protection the the device as long as I do not abuse it.  It grips the ipad well and does not come off easily, but can be removed without difficulty if desired.  All the ipad controls are easily accessed.  The window for the camera is correct for the original ipad air, but not subsequent ipad models.  I highly recommend this as a lightweight protective case.  If you want something heavy duty or waterproof, look elsewhere.  If I manage to wear this one out, I will look for another with the same features.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The iPad fits securely in the back part of the case. When the front cover is closed, it puts the tablet in sleep mode. It awakens when opened up again. I like that the front cover folds into thirds to support the tablet in landscape mode. This stand will not hold the tablet in portrait mode, but I have a separate folding stand for that, so it isn't a problem. This case looks and functions just like some much more expensive cases.  I am pleased with it!

Update! I was pleased with this case for about 6-8 months. Then it began breaking off and cracking...first one corner, then another. I am not really sure what caused the breaks, as I am the only user and don't recall dropping my iPad or any other rough stuff. When the bottom corners chipped off, it was difficult to keep the device in the cover. Eventually all 4 corners were broken off and cracking. Time for a replacement. I just received the Zover-Ultra-Lightweight-Smart-shell iPad Air Case from Amazon today. Instead of a hard plastic (and breakable) shell, this one is more like hard rubber. I am hoping it will hold up longer. The JETech cover was very reasonably priced, so I don't feel as if I'm out a lot of money.

This is comparable to the Apple brand case for a fraction of the cost and really good quality. I was skeptical at first about how well this would work/fit with my iPad but was pleasantly surprised. There are subtle differences in this case: your iPad ""clicks"" into the case and is extremely secure (my old case began to give and I was afraid it would eventually fall or slip out), the bottom section where the charge port is located is completed unobstructed/cut out. The back panel IS plastic or plastic-like and if you aren't careful with removing your iPad, the corners could split. The smart cover functions exactly like the Apple brand smart cover and turns off my iPad when it touches the screen. For the first month of using the cover to prop up the iPad, it was a little stiff and would slip off the back but it eventually began to cooperate with no issues (I'm going to attribute this to the back being plastic).

Overall, for somelike me who loves to switch out cases for her electronics, this inexpensive case is worth the price and I'm confident with the protection it offers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It fits well and is holding up to my kids rough use good so far with no tears or gouges.  The front cover is tri fold, which makes it nice to use while recording video or taking pictures, you can just fold one section down to keep the camera lens unobstructed.

This is a minimalist product but it does exactly what it claims.  First one so I'll be aware of it's durability.  Seems like very good materials.

Edit...  After four months the case cracked on one of the corners and a small piece fell off.  This in no way rendered the product unusable, just a sharp edge on one corner.  I contacted JEDirect and sent them a few pics and inquired about replacement policy.  In a few hours I received a very nice email thanking me for the information about my product, apologizing for the inconvenience, verifying my shipping address and telling me to expect an immediate replacement.  Replacement received fast in perfect condition.

It has an alright feel to it. It's the right color. It's cheap. That's the positive. The surface area of the back folded as a stand is kind of poor. So you need a flat immobile surface to set it up on. You can't put it on your couch or your bed standing up or it will probably fall. So it works for the basic purpose of keeping it clean and minor protections against drops. If you want to protect against drops, get a different case. This is cheap for a reason.

A nice sturdy smart case which covers the iPad completely in the front and back.  The iPad snaps in within seconds.  When closed it allows the iPad to sleep when its opened the top flips over and the front of the case becomes a stand.  The inside has a soft liner which prevents the iPad from becoming scratched.
For the money this a great product.  My own first cover which I paid more than double only covered the front without any protection for the back so I purchased one in red.  When buying one for my husband I decided for this price I can change colors and bought myself a blue one so I could change covers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My first one lasted about a year. This is a nice case very similar to the actual Apple case. Performs just the same. The plastic backing doesn't seem the strongest (but i have no complaints as it lasted a year) and the front cover is barely noticeably different than the apple brand. For the price difference, this is definitely the way to go. The cover is a little sharp/stiff around the edges at first, but that wears down as it gets used.

Anyway, I was going to return this but decided to try it for a few days. Well, it looks good, feels good, and thank goodness I did not return it cause now I love it! I only wish they came with a screen protector but overall it's a convenient case with different colors to choose.

This iPad basically belongs to our 5 yo son now so we let him choose the color. Red it was!

The color turned out to be very nice looking. The texture of the front is silky smooth and the back is a thick durable feeling plastic. The back snapped on very easily and stays on securely. When closing the cover, the on/off function works very well just like the original leather Apple cover.

At a fraction of the price of Apple covers this cover surprised us with good looks and functionality. We’ll definitely try more JETech covers in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The on/off works first time, every time, the case looks good and feels better.

It is thin so probably dropping it on a hard floor would not be a smart move but it will keep the Air somewhat protected, is really nice to hold and works fine when balancing it on a pillow as I lay on the couch.

Bought this as a cheaper alternative for the apple smart case and it works just as well. The cover turns off the tablet when on, it does leave dust lines on the tablet from the folds after a bit of use but nothing major.

When I bought it I also purchased a case for the iPad directly from Apple as well... which cost $80 at the time.  It worked, but not worth the $80 in my opinion.

Through the last 5 years of using the iPad Air the case eventually wore down to the point where I try to stand the iPad up in the case but it just slides out of the case.  Obviously this was just normal wear and tear over 5 years of using my iPad, but still not worth paying $80 to get the case from Apple in my opinion.

Review:  This iPad case over is great!  For one thing it's much cheaper than buying a case from Apple. Secondly it also locks into place on your iPad vs Apples iPad cover which also fit good on the iPad but it didn't lock into place.  When I say it locks into place you can hear all four corners snap into place, so you know your getting a very secure case and tight case.  This iPad case doesn't cover up the speakers or around the charging port at the bottom of the iPad Air where as Apple's iPad case does.  Because of this it's also easier to listen on the iPad when not using headphones and also makes it a little bit easier to plug in when you need to charge your iPad.  I should also mention that this case also has the magnetic strip for when you want to stand the case up.  One thing this case does lack is that it doesn't cover over the buttons on the iPad.  With that being said the buttons are still easily accessible even with the case on.

Pros:
1.  Cost significantly less than Apple's iPad Air cases
2.  Snaps into place for a very secure fit
3.  Doesn't cover the speakers on the bottom of the iPad
4.  Has magnetic strip to keep the case in position when standing it up

Cons:
1.  Since it snaps so securely into the iPad it could make some small marks on the corners of the iPad
2.  The case doesn't cover any of the buttons on the iPad (volume up, volume down, power button)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The iPad fits securely in the back part of the case. When the front cover is closed, it puts the tablet in sleep mode. It awakens when opened up again. I like that the front cover folds into thirds to support the tablet in landscape mode. This stand will not hold the tablet in portrait mode, but I have a separate folding stand for that, so it isn't a problem. This case looks and functions just like some much more expensive cases. I am pleased with it!

Update! I was pleased with this case for about 6-8 months. Then it began breaking off and cracking...first one corner, then another. I am not really sure what caused the breaks, as I am the only user and don't recall dropping my iPad or any other rough stuff. When the bottom corners chipped off, it was difficult to keep the device in the cover. Eventually all 4 corners were broken off and cracking. Time for a replacement. I just received the Zover-Ultra-Lightweight-Smart-shell iPad Air Case from Amazon today. Instead of a hard plastic (and breakable) shell, this one is more like hard rubber. I am hoping it will hold up longer. The JETech cover was very reasonably priced, so I don't feel as if I'm out a lot of money. It worked fine for several months.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_81?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=81&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've been using this one for about a month now, and here are my impressions:

It's thinner and lighter.  To me this is a neutral thing.  Thinner and lighter is great when you're carrying it around, but it also contributes to the case looking cheap and plastic-y.  To be completely fair, it's a very inexpensive case, so I don't expect it to look like the leather Apple cases at 5 times the price.

The fit isn't quite as good as the Fintie.  There's a bit of flex/wiggle on the corners when I'm using the case.  It's a bit annoying at times.  The cutouts are all perfect.

My reason for 2 stars, however, is the sleep/wake cover feature.  It doesn't work reliably.  When I first got the case, I would flip the case closed on many nights, only to wake up to a dead iPad because it didn't turn off.  This never happened with the Fintie.  Now I don't use that feature anymore, and I miss it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_153?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=153&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When I opened it initially the packaging looked cheap and I thought I had been ripped off, but when I put it the case on (I have an iPad air) I noticed that it was a perfect fit, not too tight, but not too loose either. The openings are very neat and symmetric, and they were in all the right places. Once the case is on the iPad, it definitely does not look like a ten dollar product. The auto lock-unlock feature also works perfectly. You can also use the case as a stand (see picture attached, forgive my camera quality though) which is the main reason I bought the case.

I would recommend using this product alongside a tempered glass cover just to be safe. This is not a super armor for your iPad, and I would most certainly not test this product with drop tests, but it is exactly what is advertised, a Slim-Fit Smart Case, great value for money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was concerned about the case's feel, but I was happy to see that both the back and front offer a positive grip with its matte, smooth surface. No slippery, glossy finish here! And the interior has the feel of a microfiber flannel protecting the iPad's glass from scratches. The iPad snaps snugly into the case with no effort, keeping its cutouts precisely conformed to the device's camera, buttons, microphone, speaker, etc. All of this with hardly any bulk added to the slim device. You can trust what you see in Amazon's pictures. In fact, the case closed with the iPad in it is just as thick as my stylus alone. See my picture. My package arrived with the free shipping schedule in less than 48 hours, and who can beat that great price! Kudos to JETech and Amazon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Its not a huge deal for me, but overall great case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The strength of the magnets are great and stays put when the case is closed and held upside down as well as when the cover is folded back and picked up. So there's no worry of the cover giving out while I'm typing or watching something, nor when it's in my bookbag. However, once the ipad air is in the case, it looks like it is sitting on top of the case. The back of the case barely covers the corners; it actually looks like it is clinging to the side of the ipad instead of coming up and holding it at the corners. If I wasn't concerned about making sure the corners weren't dented if the ipad fell, then it would be a great case. But I can't take it outside of my house without feeling insecure. There is no strange smell when I took it out of the packaging either.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The flip cover doesn't move around when closed so it feels tight and solid.  The magnets are also strong and hold tight when the cover is flipped around to the back.  There is a design problem to be aware of however.  There is a VERY THIN edge that results from the cutout  at the on/off switch which snapped during installation - IMO it's not able to handle the stress when the corner tab of the case snaps over the corner of the iPAD.  I imagine if I had installed this corner first it would have been okay (and leave as the last when removing the cover)  These cases are inexpensive and I don't expect them to last forever so I doubt I'll bother to return it, and will probably just use it as is.

The bottom cutout for the lightning connector and speakers could be more straight and the camera cutout more round. A simple deburring could probably correct for that.

My biggest complaint would be the headphone jack cutout. It appears to have arrived partially chipped off. I could understand how other reviewers have complained about the case chipping and/or cracking. The rear plastic back feels a little brittle.

2015.03.23 UPDATE
After two weeks of use, I noticed the cut out around the power button has already broken off. I think if this case were dropped, it'd easily crack and the iPad would pop out. I've downgraded my review to two stars. Nice case, but don't expect a lot of protection.

2015.04.02 UPDATE
I found that the cutout around the top rear microphone is cracked. It doesn't appear to affect the performance of the case but it does concern me that the case appears to be breaking down at an alarmingly fast rate despite light usage.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The material is easy to keep clean from kids dirty fingerprints.

The only downside of this case is that when the cover is flat against the back of the case the magnets cause the iPad to go to sleep.  Not fun when trying to watch a video or play a game.

Still worth the purchase for what I use it for though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_45?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=45&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Affordable price!","June 21, 2016","This is the third case I have bought for my Ipad and I can honestly say this is the closest I have gotten to a real apple smart case as one can get. The case fits very snug around the ipad and does a good job or protecting it while looking stylish. The magnetic strip on the cover is strong and keeps the lid closed in comparison to some others out there which are made from cheaper material. The overall feel of the case is very nice and it is definitely a quality product. It is hard at times to stand the ipad up on its size but all smart cases such as this which I have owned have had similar problems so nothing to worry about.

The only one issue I have is that the left side of the iPad is not completely covered due to the design of the front cover so that the cover can close. If I drop the iPad on the left side onto a corner or something sharp the iPad could get damaged because it’s not fully protected.  I love the magnetic closing feature and the feel of the back side The back cover does absorb oily fingers and you can see smudges but it’s not too bad.

What I am concerned about is the back resting thing. So basically the front cover folds up and makes the screen stand up. It's barely an angle and I'm very scared as to when it fall face down. Let's hope it doesn't break my iPad.

My biggest disappointment with this cover is the way it fits around the iPad Air. The hard plastic leaves sharp and uncomfortable edges at the corners and just about everywhere your hands hold onto the iPad. So holding the iPad for any length of time was uncomfortable.
I was also unhappy with the lack of ability to watch the iPad in landscape mode on anything but a perfectly flat surface. Example, it's nearly impossible to set the iPad down on a bed or other soft surface and have it stay in position.
I have and use daily other, much nicer covers on a iPad 4 that work better than this flimsy cover.
This style cover is better than no cover and does offer some protection for the iPad, but in everyday use, it's a poor choice.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The problem is that in less than 6 months the case has fallen apart.  It is possible that my kids initiated the case destruction or it may just be cheap quality.

I admittedly avoided buying this one because I though the low price would mean low quality. Well, how pleasantly surprised I was when this one arrived at my doorstep. Built with the same quality, fit, and finish as cases four times the price. It fits perfectly and looks just as good as Apple own overpriced smart covers.

Initially happy it how snug it fit (tho cover was a problem).  However, like other users, I noticed a crack starting to form from only 3 weeks of use from the iPad stretching the case.  Looks like the manufacturer made the tolerances too tight and/or the case too small.  The material used is a lighter and softer plastic (almost foam-like).  They should have left off the small 3 millimeter pieces of plastic near the button and speakers to allow for the snug fit without the chance for breaking.  Eventually, the iPad stretching the case will force one of these weak points to crack far sooner than expected and you’ll have plastic digging in your skin.  Never dropped the case.  Wish I could buy the more solidly made $19.95 Photive case I had used for the last 4 years.  The other problem is the cover did not magnetically snap shut like my older case so the cover tended to flop around.

Had to go through the hassle of paying $2 for a padded envelope and returning a defective product to get my $11.99 back.  At least I didn’t have to pay for the UPS shipping.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

The magnet holds shut against the iPad face and it looks super slick.
The inside cover is soft like it should be. It is only slightly less soft than the apple version, but not enough difference to worry about your iPad, let alone fork up the extra $70 for an apple one.
My only concern is at the hinge area- whwn you fold the cover around flat against the back and hold it in one hand, the cover is slightly angled off square.  Over time I wonder if the hinge will wear and the cover will feel loose even when shut. However, that is just speculation and the back cover snaps tight when installing.  Even if it break, I can get 7 or 8 to the price of 1 Apple cases and they may do the same thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It was ok but bulky with the phone inside and a bit annoying because it was either in my hand or hanging from my wrist.
And I dislike every phone case I've owned because I've managed to break every phone screen ( probably because the phone has not been in a purse :) ).
I spent at least an hour searching for a phone case, and although I was hopeful this would work based on reviews I was not overly optimistic it would work for me This phone wallet is PERFECT! The phone fits snugly in the case, the wallet snaps tightly ensuring the screen is protected and I can carry just what I need ( well, it's maxed out at 8 cards so maybe a little more).  Still room for cash.  The chain is not very strong but I've been careful and had no issues. I love that it can be worn over the shoulder or doubled up.  Talking on the phone and taking pics- easy, no issues.
Overall this wallet with my iPhone 6plus, 8 cards and cash is less bulky than my old wristlet with my iPhone 5.
I've only had this 3 weeks but it's holding up great!  For the first time ever I love a wallet/purse and phone case!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_153?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=153&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The one thing I was concerned about was the sleep/wake feature on it. My iPad has the zagg glass shield installed on the screen and I didn't know if the feature would work over that. It actually works flawlessly with no problems whatsoever. It would've been nice if the buttons on it were covered up like the apple case, but for $10 I can't complain. The case is also relatively slim which I really like as well.

The JETech cover doesn't have a magnet for auto sleep/wake, but its not an issue to manually turn the iPad on and off as needed. The thick plastic back and plastic/microfiber front are impressively well made and hold up to being used 12+ hours a day and traveling in a laptop bag on business trips. The cover folds up to be used as a stand and is very sturdy (doesn't unfurl while being used, even with some nasty turbulence on the last flight). I'd highly recommend this product to any iPad owner - don't be scared off by the low price! At ~$13 you can get multiple colors to coordinate with your outfits.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It turns off my Pad when the cover is closed.  It is smart looking, not slippery in my hands, and fits my needs perfectly.  The only problem I am having is inserting the charge cable in the dark (I read in bed at night with all the other lights off).  My last cover only had a small opening in the bottom so it was easy  to find and plug in in the dark.  This cover has a very wide opening (probably to enhance the speaker output), but the charger opening is more difficult to find by touch alone.  It will get easier as I get more familiar with it.

They were gorgeous but only good for a year or so because they got kind of dirty. I recently got an iPad Air and was having trouble finding a suitable cover. Because of the slight difference in size between the Air and the Air2, none of the cases I tried seem to fit exactly right. I bought this case as a temporary measure, thinking that eventually I would find the perfect cover. Turns out THIS IS THE PERFECT COVER! I could not be more pleased.

The port cutouts are good, the magnets are functional, (although unable to hold the front cover in place when open and swung onto the back), the material feels good (if not a tad cheap).

It's not definitely not a premium product in terms of craft or feel... but for a bog standard basic iPad cover? It's definitely worth a buy and performs well enough to last for at least a couple more years.

The plastic part around the lock button also broke after a little use, and the soft plastic on the back can easily get scratched.

One fault it has is the hinge type design is much thinner and weaker than the Apple case. When moving or picking it up the front flap slides around, making me assume this weakness could potentially lead to it tearing at some point.
The inside of the front flap is covered in a soft suede-like material to protect the front of the Ipad. However, the inside is hard plastic, unlike the Apple case. This makes me uneasy as just placing the Ipad inside doesn't offer much protection for the back of the ipad.

All-in-all for $11.99 this case does a good job of mimicking the Apple case, but lacks in the durability and protection.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

You can buy this 3 times for the price of the Apple unit which, being leather, looks pretty ratty after a year.
UPDATE:  We bought 2 of these, one black and one green and the green one has totally failed after a few months.  I don't know if it was defective or the colorants in the plastic affected it but it has totally failed, with chunks falling off...and after no abusive handling.  Of course at this price I suppose you could pitch it and buy another but that's not the point.  I WOULD NOT recommend this product

Nice sleek design and the sleep/wake cover works as described. My reason for giving it only 1 star is because 3 of the 4 corners have cracked and broken off. Also the cover doesn't support the iPad when you fold it to stand it up. It doesn't stay upright like it shows in the pictures.

-- is not bulky
-- great price!!
-- strong magnet on foldable sleep/wake cover (meaning when you prop the iPad up using that foldable over, it stays put unlike some cheap ones that collapse easily)

I thought it would be flimsy but I was wrong. I've been using the cover for about a month  and it has not disappointed.

The fit is snug and the openings are in all the right places (for speaker, headphone jack, buttons, camera etc). I'm satisfied with the level of protection as I have dropped my iPad a few of times (not from a high distance) and there are no traces of physical damage. I use it every day, mainly as part of my job so it gets hauled around a lot and the case is still in great condition. Also, both the front and back of the cover are matte, which is great since that means no unsightly fingerprints. I've spilled stuff on the cover as well and it wipes off with tissue or a damp cloth.
The front flap is magnetic as advertised and does come in handy when I use the iPad for Netflix or Youtube and the Auto sleep/wake feature does work. I have the purple and it is as gorgeous as displayed by the seller.

Will be purchasing another one and recommend it highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_39?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=39&reviewerType=all_reviews"

At first, this product worked as intended and if I had written a review, it would have been good..

I know the case didn't cost that much, but it should last longer than it did.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_70?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=70&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Surprisingly it is indeed a really good case for my iPad Air. I had a purple case that we bought originally with the iPad at BestBuy for $45 so I thought this one for less than $12 couldn't possibly be as good as that one, The old one was a brand name that I forget now, but this one is just as good as that one, and actually better since I like that it has little grooves that allows it to stand alone and my other case didn't have that. This case isn't as thick as the other one, padded,  but I like that it's thinner actually. The other case was a bit bulky for my likes. This case will power on and off the iPad with opening and closing of the cover as my more expensive older one did and it's overall just really a good iPad cover. I gave my iPad Air to my husband and thought he may like black instead of the pretty purple one I had on it haha, and I am glad I went with this one!

It was easy to slide my iPad Air into and all cutouts are just right for camera etc. I also picked this one because there's no frame around it that holds it in which I saw some others. Those with the frame seem to have issues at times as it sometimes blocks things on the screen (according to the reviews I read) such as a sensor that is able to detect when the light in a room is dimmer and therefore the iPad display will brighten or lighten accordingly. The case is easy to wipe off if needed and doesn't show oily or greasy fingerprints like my old case did so I like that about this one too. I couldn't find anything that I don't like about it so it gets 5 stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_156?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=156&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The old one was getting worn down after a year and a half of heavy use and the plastic near the power button also just broke off on its own after a year. I thought it was a great case, looks nice, magnetic lock works, stand worked when placed on hard even surfaces so I would've probably rated that 5 stars. However, this new one I got, I had to almost force my ipad into because it didn't easily click in like the old one. And now I see that the iPad in the case looks bent as shown in the picture and I'm afraid to try and get it out, out of fear that I'll bend it even more trying to remove it. So while I think it's still a good looking case, with great functionality, I feel like they either changed the design dimensions slightly or I got a defective product. Now that I'm looking at the most recent reviews, I'm thinking I got a defective product from a bad batch, as there seem to be some recent complaints, but there are also a lot of great reviews.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Case does fit the Air exactly and opening and closing the front flap does turn the iPad on and off as advertised, hence the 2 star rating.

I thought it would be flimsy but I was wrong. I've been using the cover for about 3 months and it has not disappointed.

The fit is snug and the openings are in all the right places (for speaker, headphone jack, buttons, camera etc). I'm satisfied with the level of protection as I have dropped my iPad a few of times (not from a high distance) and there are no traces of physical damage. I use it every day, mainly as part of my job so it gets hauled around a lot and the case is still in great condition. Also, both the front and back of the cover are matte, which is great since that means no unsightly fingerprints. I've spilled stuff on the cover as well and it wipes off with tissue or a damp cloth.
The front flap is magnetic as advertised and does come in handy when I use the iPad for Netflix or Youtube and the Auto sleep/wake feature does work. I have the purple and it is as gorgeous as displayed by the seller.

Will be purchasing another one and recommend it highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_212?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=212&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've dug through dozens of cases at the Apple store, at Frys, and at Best Buy and I did not find one that was as simple and elegant of a solution as this one. Furthermore, it's competition cost $30 or more. It feels great in the hands, it's super thin, and there are no rough edges.

Before this, I had a Dodo case on my previous iPad which was $70 and it was pretty classy (it was the same one the President had on his iPad) but the bamboo frame broke. Also, I don't want to be paying $70 (or $90 for the new multi-angle case) extra every time I get a new iPad. Who am I trying to impress?

One thing that was unexpected is that the microfiber interior of the screen cover is grey whereas in the photos it looked beige. I would have preferred beige but at this price point I can't complain. I could buy one in every color for the price of my previous case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The replacement that I received a couple of weeks ago is different. It no longer has to snap in place to hold the iPad (I think that is what caused the other one to crack and chip).

My only issue (and this may be for all cases) is that when holding it in the open position the iPad tends to drop downward while the cover part that is now folded back stays put in your hand. This causes a twisting of the ""hinge"" part. When you open the cover and fold it back on itself the cover stays straight in your hand but the rest of it twists and pulls downward.  This may be because there isn't a hinge on the case, but rather a flexible cover that's attached to the hard plastic back. So it's just like a piece of firm fabric that wraps over from the back to the front and doesn't provide any stability from twisting in the ""hinge"" area.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The fit is perfection-itself, no wobbling or re-adjusting.  This may sound odd, but it even has helped with the battery life.  Before this, I had kept it in the case of my old Samsung Galaxy tablet, and the battery started to go down fairly quickly.  Now, it only goes down by a percent or two, overnight.

I've ordered this case three times now, so I am definitely a satisfied customer. It fits closely to the iPad and doesn't add much bulk at all. I dislike bulky cases whether for my phone or tablet. I mean...what's the use of the newer models getting sleeker and slimmer just to plop on a huge bulky case on them that makes them look as if I am carrying an older model anyway?  The magnetic snap close feature is wonderfully efficient and inconspicuous. I like that it shuts off the screen upon closing saving precious battery life.
Previously,  I had cases that required an elastic band or button to snap it close. Yuck.

WHO THIS CASE DOES NOT WORK BEST FOR
This case is NOT for those who are usually rough, tough, and/or clumsy with their $500 pieces of technology. This case will not protect your iPad from 5 to 6 foot drops on hard floors. This case will not protect iPad from outright carelessness. This case will not protect your case from unruly children bent on destruction.  What this case does protect your iPad from is: major to minor scratches; short drops (less than 2 feet) on carpeted floors; and dirt for the most part.

WHO THIS CASE WORKS BEST FOR
This case is for the usually gentle and careful owners who want to keep their iPad looking like it's right out of the box and only have the occasional mishap where it may slide off the bed or couch onto a floor of fluffy carpet.

ONE CON FOR ME
The only caveat to this case for me is how dirty the inside of the front flap can get after a while. You have to keep cleaning it or get a new one when it gets too dirty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This is without dropping it or abusing it in any way.
After one year of use both of the corners near the side that folds, had completely broken out, preventing the iPad from staying in the case.
I sent an email to tech support, and was told that my case was a few days out of warranty, and that they would not provide a replacement.
If you buy one of these and have a problem with cracking of the plastic, contact tech support right away, and you might get a replacement.
If you wait like I did, you will be out of luck.

Other than the broken plastic, I like the design, and will buy another one to replace it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This single unit gives similar protection for about 1/4 the cost of my previous solution. While the back has a pleasing feel similar to the Apple unit, the front has a decidedly cheap plasticy feel to it. But the magnetic on/off function works fine, and it gives me a decent grip, and protects the screen. The trifold front also works slightly better than the original Apple unit, mostly because it's attached to the rear instead of magnet to the side. Bottom line, cheap and functional.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The shipping was fast and my package arrived in A+++ condition. PRO: I was very impressed with the quality of this iPad case. It looks very similar to the Apple iPad cases, only this one is a fraction of the cost! I like how the back cover has a hard texture to help protect the iPad. I actually thought it would have the velvet feel like the Apple case. I like the backing on this case better. I like how both the back and front offer a positive grip with its matte, smooth surface. It's soft to the touch and definitely will work in protecting the iPad. The interior has the feel of a microfiber flannel protecting the iPad's glass from scratches. There is hardly any bulk added to the slim device.

However, I will be sending this item back. I was disappointed in the color of my iPad Air Case. According to the picture, the case looked like a vibrant, bright purple. Instead, I received a very deep, dark purple. This was not the color I was expecting for the price I paid for it. I plan on purchasing another case in a different color (blue).

This one is just off the mark for me which is why I only gave it 4 stars. I know this model of iPad is getting to be on the older side so companies have moved on to the new and more current stuff but I have 2 marks that I was a little disappointed in, one more than the other. The lesser of two issues I have is the felt liner inside. It just doesn’t feel up to the standards of other cases I’ve owned even in the same price range. The felt is very thin and not very soft feeling as I’ve experienced with other brands. It’s still fine and I’m sure does the job, but it is a small mark in my book. The bigger issue of the two is the magnetic cover and the auto wake feature. The magnets are very weak and it doesn’t always wake the screen much less keep the cover closed like it should in what little bit of use that I’ve used it since I received it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The access slots (camera, on/off, earbud port, etc.) are all correctly located, and provide more useable access than did the Apple case.  It is a little stiffer than the Apple case, i.e. not as ""rich"" feeling, which may indicate a little lesser quality of materials.  But who cares!

Within a month of purchasing the JETech case all of the corner have chipped or broken completely off. It makes the iPad slide out of the case easily and provides no protection. This is an adult owned and operated iPad so no major drops and falls have caused the case to crack, break, and chip this way. I've contacted JETech several weeks ago to see if I possibly just received a faulty case but have yet to receive a response. It's definitely a let down as the JETech case feels a lot nicer to the touch than Fintie and provides more of a grip, but it's useless if the iPad cannot be contained in the case.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Kubota","Worth about as much as I paid.","November 14, 2014","At a quick glance it's a nice looking cover.  The finish for the most part is smooth and even.  But upon closer examination it appears to be relatively cheaply made.  The rear of the hard shell has a nice uniform finish, although mine arrived with a chip/blemish in the rubber coating near the camera hole.  The rubber coating on the shell is actually a little slippery so don't expect to get a lot of grip out of this.  The inside of the shell is hard plastic with no lining of any kind- not a shock at this price point.  The edges along the border where the shell meets the screen are a bit rough and unfinished in some parts so it's not the cleanest look.  The iPad fits fine- snaps right in and the holes for everything (camera, mics, etc.) are close enough.  It feels very secure.  The folding cover works as it should, locking the iPad; and the fit is also good here.  The outer plastic on mine looks like it separated a bit (or never molded quite right), but it's not a big deal.  The inside lining seems like it will protect the screen from scratches.

In all, it's worth about the ten bucks I paid- maybe even a bit more.  But it's nowhere close to the quality of the Apple covers.  For me, it was a cheap experiment and I'll probably just breakdown and buy the Apple cover.  After all, we are talking about a $500+ piece of hardware.  Not a bad deal at all- just know what to expect!","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Value. A Story of a Case's Life Well Lived.","October 5, 2016","When my original Apple Smart Cover for my iPad Air finally ripped, I began looking for an alternative case/cover combo that would protect my iPad, look just as good, but hopefully cost just a fraction of the price. I came across the JETech iPad Air Slim-Fit Case, and decided that I couldn't go wrong for the price. I ordered it, not sure what to expect.

The case arrived and I pulled it out of it's nondescript packaging. I was immediately struck by how nice the case felt in my hand. I expected it to have the feel of plastic, but it actually feels more like a suede type finish, very similar to the Smart Cover that I originally had. It is smooth, but sufficiently grippy in my hand. The inside of the ""cover"" portion was made of a micro-fiber like material–again, just like the Smart Cover–that not only protected the display but also may have provided a similar ""cleaning"" effect as it moved around on the screen.

I put it on my iPad and was pleasantly surprised to find that it fit perfectly and added very little bulk or weight. A simple ""snap"" in place, and it was securely on. The cover closed exactly as it was supposed to, and the iPad woke up and went to sleep as I opened and then closed it again. So far, I was impressed.

The real test, however, was whether or not it would protect my iPad from my children, of which I have several. Would this case withstand their incessant thievery of my iPad, their greasy and grimy fingers as they unscrupulously tapped on the display to find the latest episode of ""Disney Collector"", or their propensity to drop the iPad every time they walked into the Kitchen? Only time would tell.

I don't recall when I purchased this product for the first time. Several days ago, however, I came home to find that one of my precious offspring had dropped the iPad on the tile floor. It was laying on the counter when I came home. A loving sibling of the guilty party was quick to inform me of the infraction, menacingly–even, perhaps, enjoyable–telling me that her sister had ""broken the iPad"". But she was wrong. The iPad was NOT broken. The case had broken. A small, corner had chipped off, and as a result, the case no longer snapped on to the iPad.

Nay, my daughter had not broken my iPad after all. In fact, what she had done was prove that this case had done precisely what this case was purchased to do: it had protected my iPad from what would no doubt have been a cracked screen, had the case not taken the blow on it's behalf.

I immediately signed in to Amazon, and bought another JETech iPad Air Case. If it protected my iPad once, it could do it again. When it arrived, the old one went into the trash can. Job well done, my friend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Weiser","Too fragile","May 12, 2015","I now have had several of these.  The first one lasted several months until I dropped my iPad--case did what it was supposed to.  My iPad survived the approx 4ft fall onto concrete--but the case broke in several places. Ordered another--the corners almost immediately broke off in normal use.  Ordered another--same thing happened.  So..in my experience, this is just too fragile.  Definitely a bargain price..but you get what you pay for I guess. On the plus side..iPad fit perfectly and this is very light.  Barely noticeable.  If they can make the corners stronger, I would order again, even at a higher price","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_37?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=37&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I ended up buying a Speck case for a little more, but it is definitely better quality and offers more durability. I feel you pay and arm and a leg for an IPad you might as well get a quality case that offers protection.

I also like being able to fold the case halfway back in a triangular shape when viewing in portrait mode and using the case as kind of a handle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews"

See attached picture. The case partially covers the back-facing camera lens which crops into the image and creates a very large top vignette. So this version DOES NOT PROPERLY WORK FOR IPAD AIR 2 (5th Generation - Latest/Newest iPad Air).

Also just a side note, The interior of the case (the part that the back of the iPad is constantly resting in, is made of hard plastic. There is no soft material so I can only imagine that over time it may rub/wear the back of the iPad. This is only a theory because I did not keep this case long enough to find out because I am returning it.

The sleep/wake works flawlessly the only thing id say is the magnet isn't as strong as i've seen in other cases.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews"

How ever  does not fit the iPad Air 2 perfectly. While the iPad does fit in securely, the camera opening is way off covering the camera partially. Microphone is covered. There is a noticeable gap between the iPad back and the cover. Works if you don't care about the camera, mic and the gap. Maybe a new version would come out for iPad Air 2.

UPDATE: This cover drains battery in my iPad Air 2 when the cover is in closed position. I think this has something to do with a mismatch of the smart switch magnet or the magnet is not strong enough to keep the smart switch in off position all the time. What I noticed is the cover doesn't always turn on/off the iPad when the cover is flipped, its intermittent. Secondly, I noticed my battery was draining real fast when not in use. From 100% to 70% in less than half a day, when I hardly use the iPad for less than 2 Hrs, and left it in closed position. When I look at the battery usage, thh most power consumption is by startup screen and touch id screen. This tells me the iPad keeps turning on and off when the over is closed. I noticed the battery loose 1% in 5 mins when nothing is running in background and cover closed. As a test I left the cover open for 4 Hrs, the battery hasn't lost even 1%. Holding steady at 59%. This is major issue for me. This cover is going to trash.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-Smart-Cover-Sleep/product-reviews/B07HJ5G6DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_115?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=115&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My only criticism would be that the magnetic front cover doesn’t stick to the back when folded over, which can be inconvienent when you’re holding it.
