Feels wonderful in my hands and responds perfectly in my games (primarily Skyrim and Fallout).  I can't say enough about how comfortable and well-laid out it is.  The quality is obvious in the feel of the buttons, the motion of the sticks, and the texture of the plastic.  Seems pretty solid, though I tend to treat my devices well enough that I don't have to testify as to their durability first-hand.  Once it's connected I have no problems with it, but I've had to uninstall/reinstall it a number of times to get it to reconnect to the only machine that I've ever used it with (a Windows 10 desktop).  I don't have this problem with any other bluetooth device, so I'm drawing the conclusion that it's this controller.  I can't speak to the range, as I sit only 4 feet from my computer, but it never drops connection once it's in use.

There is no need for what I am doing.  I am sitting in front of my computer, and my keyboard has a USB port in it.  This keeps the controller powered, and connected, and there is no wireless lag even possible.  This is important for games like CSGO, etc.  So, that is what I use.

Setting this up in windows 10 is as easy as plugging a USB cable into the controller and plugging the controller into the PC.  That was it.  Then, I started using it on games immediately.  It is great, it really makes PC games feel more like Xbox One games, but, I like the PC games much more.  So, now I use the controller for the majority of the things that I do in the game, but I still have the keyboard for the more complex games where there isn't enough buttons on the controller like ""Elite Dangerous"" which is one of my current favorites.

For now, I use the two analog sticks for normal flying, and for landing, and they are great.  The digital up/down/left/right is my throttle in normal flight and my forward back, left right in landing.  The triggers are obviously for guns, and the other buttons do common functions.  It makes playing the game a lot easier than using the mouse and keyboard.  While, I agree there are games that the mouse is better for, it is nice to have the option.

I opted for the brand name controller after hearing people having issues with the knock-offs.  I also opted for the wired simply out of simplicity and not wanting the possibility of introducing wireless lag.  That said, I couldn't connect wirelessly as-is, it requires an adapter to use this wireless, not sure why as it is Bluetooth, but that seems to be the requirement.  Maybe I am doing something wrong, not sure, but I wasn't able to get it to work.  However, using it wired is as simple as plug and play.  I couldn't be happier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Happy Gaming!!

My OLD review for this controller stated that this controller was NOT compatible with iOS, and those reasons still apply for versions of iOS LESS THAN iOS 13:

""Contrary to some of the customer answers for this product, it is NOT compatible with iPhone or iPad or any iOS device.""

Sadly, I read answers saying it would be compatible, then ordered the controller only to find out it was not. The reason why, after some Googling, was that it lacks something called MIFI Certification—something required by iOS.""

""However, it IS 100% compatible with Macs (connecting as a Bluetooth device) and I was able to use it for some mac games — it's an incredibly comfortable controller, I only wish I could use it with my iPhone games.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After a Windows update that I received a few months back, my trusty old USB wired Xbox 360 controller stopped working properly.  The controller itself was fine, as it still works normally on my windows 8 PC - but on my Win 10 machines some features - rumble most importantly - just won't work any longer.

It sucks that I've become so used to rumble as I know many prefer to play with it turned off.  But for me, it provides useful haptic feedback that helps me more easily time my button presses in games like Rocket League.

Anyway, in an attempt to get the rumble feature working again I purchased a new, Xbox One S controller......whiiiiich has the exact same issues as the 360 controller...

It looks like Microsoft switched to a new controller input driver recently which could be the cause for all of this madness.  But you would think that they'd test their new input driver for stability before pushing it out to the masses...

So basically just know that if you're buying this controller for PC, rumble WILL NOT work (regardless of whether it's connected with the wire or over Bluetooth) and regardless of whether or not your rumble preference is enabled on Steam.

TL;DR:
Just buy a PS4 Controller.  The PC drivers for it are handled through a 3rd party application which seems like a more reliable route since Microsoft has a tendency to break their own products with software updates.  Rumble works on the PS4 controllers and even works when they're connected over Bluetooth!","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I can't seem to get direct bluetooth to work with windows 10.  It works with another xbox one dongle I already had and it works with the USB cable.  But, I still can't confirm this works with bluetooth (b/c it doesn't work for me yet even after checking for updates).  I'm not sure if my PC is too old or if these have been over sold.  They work nicely aside from that, so still giving 4 stars.  I'd give 5 if the bluetooth would work natively.
UPDATE 1/15/2019!!  You *CAN* make these work with bluetooth natively in Windows 10.  The trick is when you click ""Add bluetooth or other device"" in the Control Panel, you must select ""Bluetooth"" not ""Everything else"" EVEN THOUGH the Xbox controller is mentioned on that list.  The ""everything else"" list is meant for Xbox controllers using the XBox wireless adapter.  Duh, kind of my fault / misread.  Attaching picture so others can learn from my mistake.
The controllers work pretty darn well.  Every so often if you are too far from the bluetooth dongle/antenna they can disconnect.  Luckily many windows games I'm playing recognize the disconnect and kind of wait for you to get it back.

Fluidity and FPS are even more fun with this controller!  I'm sure the elite version is very impressive and will probably try it out soon.  Bluetooth is a great option and glad they added it!

Sticks are precise, bumpers are fixed, and the textured grip feels great in the hand. LB and RB now great for shifting in driving games; so easy to use. MS already spent millions designing the Xbone controller and the mid-term then this upgrade really were great enhancements. Actually I'd call the bumpers more a ""fix"" than an enhancement. They used to be awful. The Bluetooth is reliable and setup is easy. I use batteries and the controller is very efficient with them. The impulse triggers are great but unfortunately aren't implemented in many games. They are in Forza though. It doesn't only ""feel"" better but actually helps to play the game for instance if you want to modulate when you brake with ABS off. Same for helping to control acceleration.

PC you need USB and Xbox accessories app for global button mapping and firmware updates. So not often if at all.

There also were/are a ton of different special editions and colors for more $$$ and the Design Lab which is really cool but more $$$. Black and white are fantastic together in my book and cost the least. This latest ""S"" version feels like it is built much butter than the older versions.

Models:
1537
2013-15
* Intro Xbone controller
* Impulse triggers
* ""Improved"" D-Pad
* Better grip texture on sticks
* Less latency/faster response

1697
2015-16
* 3.5mm and headset jack on the bottom
* Can get wireless firmware updates on console
* Awful clicky and heavy bumpers that you have to push exactly right are fixed
* Sticks have more tension/resistance
* Buttons have more heft

1698
2015
* The Elite (no Bluetooth but rumor about 2nd generation in the works)

1708 (S)
2016
* Texture and color of plastic around logo is different and more integrated; matte instead of shiny
* Bluetooth
* Textured grip on the back. Again overall quality feels nicer I don't feel like I'm getting ripped off paying this much for a controller...bumpers and buttons feel better once more
* Thumbstick movement is steadier and smoother (more resistance; smoother circular rotation)
* Console owners have better range up to 40ft away
* Probably some of the what they learned designing the Elite trickled down to this model
 * They fixed the problem with white powder under the sticks after prolonged use

Edit: Left stick broke after a few months of use. Great controller, terrible build quality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, that was a mistake, as it does not work over Bluetooth on Windows 7. Looking through the product description, the reviews, and the Q&A section I got the impression that it would work. It seems like it did work at one time, but Microsoft has since broken the drivers that allowed it to work with Windows 7. It does seem to work wired, but it's not worth paying extra for wireless connectivity that doesn't work. I probably spent about 10 hours trying to get it to work, and I even bough an Xbox One wireless adapter, but I just couldn't get it to work. At the very least I was able to return it, but I'll never get back the time I wasted trying to get this to work.

I would not recommend getting this controller if you plan on using it wireless on Windows 7.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The connection process took less then 3 minutes and I was back to gaming like my first controller didnt break.

While on the subject any game controller can get something known as 'Drifting' where the controller is recieving analog stick input even when the player isnt touching them. There are multiple DIY solutions to that but I dont recommend doing them as most involve manipulating the controllers hardware .

This option comes at a consumer price that most branded items will be at. Overall highly recommend when in need of a controller.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The moment I first picked up the controller, I knew it was going to be bad.  To preface this, the controller after being used would always be disconnected from the cable, and would be placed in the paper cradle that it comes with in the box, keeping it away from anything that may damage it.  The controllers body was loose and creaked like an 18th century wood floor.  Within 8 months, the controller managed to develop stick drift on both sticks, left stick pulls top right, and right stick pulls bottom left, completely opposite directions of each other.  After going through 3 Microsoft agents, (one disconnected the call from me, one said they couldn't replace it, and the other spent 50 minutes to come to the same conclusion as the last one).  Buy a dualshock if you can tolerate the ergonomics, or purchase an aftermarket/moddable xbox controller instead of this chinesium trash.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have tried to reset my xbox multiple times, I reconnected my other contollers to test it out and those reconnected fine. I also plugged in the USB cord and tired to update the controller which did not work since it didn't need to be updated, and if I unplugged the USB from the controller and tried to reconnect it after, the xbox still would not recognize the controller even after being hooked up to it. The xbox troubleshooting didn't help and I couldn't find anything online to fix it. The only way for this controller to work is to use a USB cord and plug it into the Xbox One. My USB cord is not long enough and I'm too close to the TV when I plug it in, and if I wanted a wired controller I'd get one.

The other weird thing is the center ""x"" button in the center. My other controllers have a button that is slightly domed. This one is flat and just feels weird. It is more awkward to press than the domed version. It just made me wonder if this was really a knock-off, instead of the real deal.

It works well, but I find myself plugging it in via USB because of the poor battery life and Bluetooth connection issues.

Pros
- Comfortable to hold
- Wireless

Cons
- The battery doesn't last long
- No low battery warning
-  Sometimes it doesn't connect to my PC via Bluetooth

All in all, it's a good controller but the wireless experience is not perfect.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Very responsive for fast past play. The triggers have great grip to them and it feels right in my hand. It came with a new set of batteries and not cheap ones. There is no cable which would have annoyed me since I am using this on a PC not an xbox. However the one I had just recently bought for my ps4 controller as a replacement also works for this controller. Since the chord is replaceable no more issues there. Can easy replace that. No in the controller batteries so not really an issue.

If you do, get ready for the controller to randomly shut off and disconnect during gameplay, especially fun during online games. That's with a full battery. Everytime I plug it in via USB to recharge the battery, it forces me to resync it with my laptop when I use it wirelessly. I just keep it plugged in whenever I play any games now, because constantly getting disconnected is really irritating. It defeats the purpose of buying a wireless controller, but don't worry, there's a separate wireless adapter sold separately for your already wireless controller....Microsoft at its best.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My experience with gaming consoles is mostly through Playstation, but bought this controller for PC applications and didn't do much research.  Build quality seems good, but I was surprised to see that it comes with two AA batteries and not a rechargeable battery, like the wireless Playstation controller.  I see now that you can purchase a rechargeable battery at extra cost, but several reviewers have complained of poor battery life.
Connecting the controller to my PC via Bluetooth was fairly easy, but if you want the rumble, then you will need to purchase a separate USB fob to enable the functions over a wireless connection.

For starters the controller now has bluetooth and supports connectivity to your PC straight through that connection with no need for the wireless adapter anymore (if you have bluetooth of course). Second major improvement is the texture of the whole controller, there is now a textured grip on the back of the handles which makes for holding it for long times much more comfortable. Also the new plastic has very smooth almost sand blasted feel to it that makes it less prone to fingerprints and just feels like a much nicer product because of it. Thirdly the bumper buttons now are much quieter and require a slight amount less force to activate.The last improvement I cant confirm but the rubber and buttons are supposed to last much longer, this was a very bad problem with the old Xbox 360 controllers so glad to see that is constantly being improved.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Firstly, the controller didnt allow me to speak through headset (wasted even more money buying 2 pairs of headphones) even though I could hear my own feedback, it just doesn't do anything with the audio. And then the audio stopped going through the headset altogether. All this while my 4 year old controller's audio and microphone still works even though it is  overall in worse condition than my 2 recently purchased controllers. The worst part is everything other than the audio works just great. I've already wasted 100 dollars, yet my only option is to buy another controller.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I actually researched the Xbox controllers and found multiple reviews warning of this same weakness in them, but figured it was worth a try at the discounted price of an open-box controller. Then my ""like new"" one came via The-Open-Box and arrived with, you guessed it, a defective right shoulder button switch. This was disappointing, but it gave me a chance to test the rest of its functionality, and I must admit, I found the Steam Controller (the first I ever owned, btw) to be much more ergonomic and intuitive as far as its somewhat different layout, so I'll be going back to Steam, in spite of the poor switch quality of both controllers.

1. It comes with everything you'll need in a carry case including batteries
2. Button mapping is easy to set and can be for the thumbsticks you click in or triggers you hold
3. There are four preloaded thumbstick sensitivity curve types to set and adjust
4. All three thumbstick sets glide smooth with the shell not grinding it. And the long type is way more accurate in sniping games
5. It has two different D-Pads one is good for quarter combo moves
6. The triggers have a deadzone tuning for a quicker or slower timing reaction every time you pull it
7. You can make the trigger and sticks swap sides when button mapping
8. The vibration can be adjusted for any motor and sets with the configuration you make
9. The Guide button brightness adjusting sets with the configuration you make
CONS
1. A analog stick in the controller can get loose and start drifting even though it's never been dropped
2. There isn't a real good grip on the convex thumbstick set like the other two sets
3. You can't combo button map to any button, trigger or thumbstick
4. You can't mirror map one trigger to the other trigger but can with thumbsticks
5. While setting your triggers deadzone the trigger doesn't vibrate to make it accurate
6. You can only invert the y axis of the thumbstick and not the x axis
7. There is no inner or outer deadzone settings for the thumbsticks to set like the triggers have
8. There is no x and y axis thumbstick sensitivity to adjust separately
9. You can't make your own thumbstick sensitivity curves and can only choose the preloaded ones","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

There are 2 versions of the x1 controller. There are several differences and you may want to choose which one you think you'll prefer. i'll refer to the 1st gen as 1st and the 2nd gen as 2nd

-1st gen has inferior connection, while the 2nd has further connection range and Bluetooth (this is not important)

-1st gen face buttons are sunk deeper into the controller, while the 2nd has much higher face buttons (i prefer 1st gen height)

-2nd gen has a coarse plastic grit on the back of the controller while 1st is smooth, this is not helpful in any way it simply irritates your hands at best.

-1st gen has a smoother plastic used all around the controller while the 2nd has less smooth plastic

-2nd gen bumpers are FAR SUPEROIR to 1st gen, the perfect amount of resistance to use. (one of the main problems with 1st gen x1 controllers)

-2nd gen does not require an accessory to use a microphone with you can plug in a microphone with just the controller it's self

-2nd gen controller has quality issues I ONLY HAVE ONE however, the controller i received has some strange issues when i play with it, the sides do not feel solid what so ever and the plastic is no sealed properly, also the sticks have difficulty clicking down when pushed to a certain angle. (i've dropped my 1st gen countless times and it still feels higher quality than my brand new 2nd gen)

I can conclude that both xbox1 controllers are superior to 360s however.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_81?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=81&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Original Review: 1/1/2018
This controller works great! Just as good, or better than the original controller I got with my Xbox One. So far it is holding up my a lot of use without showing any signs of wear. I cannot comment on the claim of ""Get up to twice the wireless range compared to previous Xbox One Controllers (tested using the Xbox One S Console)"" - This is due to the fact that I never had range issues before with my original Xbox One controller. I can only say that, so far, I have had no range issues.

Pros:
Thumb-sticks feel great - with good grip and good movement.
Thumb-sticks also snap back to centered position as they should when released.
All the buttons have good responses and good feel to them.
The actual grip on the controller has some small bumps to help with grip. I find this to be especially nice if your hands are a little slick. (Could be from sweaty hands, or maybe putting hand lotion on before playing).
Overall quality of the material is good - feels like a very solid controller that should last awhile.

Cons:
I have not found any yet. If a issue does occur I will update this review!

Overall its a great controller, that should (hopefully) last me a long time!","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Controller feels great in hand and does its job at first but after a few months the buttons stop working.  Immensely frustrating after going through a few of these expensive pieces of hardware.  I wish Microsoft would price this item according to the quality which is literally throw-away.  Imagine spending 40+ dollars on one of those throw-away cameras we used to buy as kids only this piece of hardware is NECESSARY for the daily use of the actual product.  How disgraceful.
I am very gentle with my electronic devices.  I don't throw them around or drop them or smash them excessively, why would the main function of a controller simply stop working as designed?  I realise this is a long-winded rant but I can't continue to pour money into worthless crap like this.  Please make this right Microsoft.  You owe me three controllers.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

It performs well and I consider it to be a great asset to any gaming PC rig.

My thoughts on the battery/cable situation. If you will be utilizing bluetooth connectivity with your PC, do not buy the Play & Charge kit. After each time you recharge the battery using the included cable, assuming you are using Windows 10, you will have to re-pair the controller every time after you disconnect the cable and power the controller by battery. You can avoid this major hassle by just using rechargeable battery full time without the cable. I made the mistake of purchasing that accessory, and ended up going with some Eneloop recharge batteries instead. Much simpler.

Happy gaming.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So I decided to order a new one, not only does this controller have terrible stick drift brand new. It's even worse than my old controller. I will be contracting Microsoft for a replacement.

The worse stick is the right stick which will be 0.092 by default on no drift. Move the stick down and up and it's sitting at 0.2. It makes me look down on all the games I play even before it drifts.

Update: I got a replacement for the current one and the replacement also has stick drift issues on the left stick. Nearly the same as my current one that I wanted to replace (sits at 0.5 and is at 0.1 after drift, where my old one is 0.6 and is at 0.12 after drift).

The first problem and main one is that after not touching the right stick for more than three seconds it will pan all the way up making you have to touch it only to have it go back. in games where the right stick is not used as much it makes the game very impossible to play like rocket league. The controller will also start to become super sensitive, at points when selecting different things whether on the home page or in game simply pushing the stick over briefly will make the selection cursor move multiple spaces which is very frustrating to try and select anything. The last problem is that when listening through headphones the audio will randomly randomly cut out and in (no it is not on my end of the port). I understand that this is not a common issue because controllers are made to last way longer than mine and I know that Xbox controllers are very good it just seems that mine is an odd one out, and I am very disappointed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_121?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=121&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Compared to ds4 this feels underwhelming low tech. It feels 5 years behind. No trackpad, no light bar, no speaker.
Worst of all, there is no included rechargeable battery. It uses AA or a seperate $20 pack. The plus of this is that it's easily replaceable, the cons: cost, and that the overcharge protection is built into a proprietary charging cable instead of into the controller itself; so is the charging indictor. Lol what.

General build feels solid. The triggers feel great. L1 R1 are satisfying, and R2 L2 have deep play with good feeling resistance. The offset left analog isn't as bad as it felt on older Xbox controllers, I actually don't feel off using it.

Analog sticks show great sensitivity. I'm not sure if there is 6 axis tilt like the ds4. It doesn't show up in the windows test screen.

For Android it works a x input, plug and play. Windows 7 over been having spotty recognition by app, but the system registers it easily and detects presses, might just need an update.

At $43 plus another $20 for a battery it's barely 3 star. It feels and performs slightly better than a $20-30 generic. It's okay. 3 stars is based on it hopefully lasting years.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I use it via bluetooth. The controller itself is good in that it works, but it's 2018 and a rechargeable battery and cable is sold separately, even on this improved revision. It's a little crazy that it took a revision to allow it to work without a dongle for PC too... but at least it does now. For review purposes, for the product listed and nothing more, the controller is just okay, requires 2x AA batteries (first are included, at least), but it doesn't have a USB cable. It uses a micro USB connector, so hopefully you have one (long enough for your circumstances) handy. The wireless radio (maybe BT specific?) emits a very high pitched whine, but it's very dependent on direction, proximity, and ambient noise... and probably personal hearing too.

I don't prefer the texture given to the hard plastic of the back side of the controller, but it's not necessarily bad. this I'd probably like it if I didn't prefer the materials of another controller I own. I also don't prefer the domed buttons compared to flatter topped buttons. Those things are purely subjective, and not ""bad""... and since I'm super nitpicking, I don't like the plastic it's made out of, but that's a silly remark, even if true.

Note: this was entirely my own fault, but when I first tried to use this controller I had enormous range problems. My motherboard has a wifi/bt card, but I use a wired connection, so I didn't have the antennas installed, and the connectivity was basically non existent. It paired, but had a range of maybe 1FT. The BT signal relies on the same antennas as wifi, which seems pretty obvious now, but I hadn't realized I hadn't installed the antennas since I last rebuilt my PC (since I wasn't really using them). Just a heads up.

Regarding BATTERIES: At MSRP, the controller and the official play and charge kit comes out to be somewhere around $84. There are slightly cheaper third party battery packs, though mainly due to the fact that they're often sold as 2 packs, but if they're anything like my older 360 battery pack, their lifetime endurance is questionable. Even the quoted playtime varies greatly in their product descriptions, so a 2 pack of third party batteries will quote 2x 12 hours, while the official single battery quotes 30 hours. I don't know if either of these numbers are accurate, but if nothing else, reviews suggest that the third party batteries are inconsistent, so I'm probably just going to (bc I haven't yet) pay the extra for the official one, and hope their QA is on point. No matter what, I think this is an obnoxious process to have to deal with. Even if replaceable batteries can be advantageous, not including one (at least in the revision) is BS to me.

As a complete rechargeable controller, with a cable to use for wired play, this is the most expensive normal controller for a console.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_171?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=171&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought this controller so that we would have 2 for when my son's friends come over. Didn't realize when I bought it that it has a jack for headphones. Great! My son was excited to play with friends online and be able to talk to them via headset. But days after using the controller the right button got stuck and you couldn't toggle left at all, and the headset jack stopped working.

I contacted Amazon for help and was issued a replacement controller. Within days the same issues happened with the replacement. I contacted Amazon again and was issued another replacement controller. We received it 4 days ago. I was just informed that the headset jack stopped working.

I'm going to contact Amazon again and request a refund.

Don't waste your money on this controller.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

After 2 weeks (yes...2 WEEKS), this one's headphone jack started to go out as well. Something else I just noticed, if you leave the controller untouched, the right thumbstick stays pushed slightly downward (haven't seen that happen since my old 360 controller). It also randomly losses connection.

SO, when I contacted the seller, they said contact Microsoft. Microsoft, after a cyclic, half-hour, click adventure, said that I qualified for a replacement. They notified me that they'd sent a replacement ""by ground"", I could get no more information, just ground. Not Fedex. Not USPS. Not UPS. How can you track any possible shipment, without any tracking number, or anything? YOU CAN'T!

Then they sent me an email, that my case was closed, and that the controller (not cheap by the way), was ""delivered"". Where? To whom? So they left a $60 item just sitting somewhere...unannounced??!! (Sound familiar?)

Before you even USE the controller for the first time, open up the controller just so that you're able to remove the face plate and expose the circuit boards, and get some krazy glue or gorilla glue (any kind of glue that is durable and non-corrosive). Look on the left sides of the little metal boxes where the joysticks usually are on the controller and you'll notice some dark gray piece. THAT is what causes the almost inevitable stick drift that cannot be fully fixed later on without some advanced component replacement that involves soldering. You will want to glue that down into place (since Micro$oft uses cheap materials) by gluing around the sides of that little dark gray panel. I did this about a year ago and my controller has not encountered stick drift at all.

As for my review of the controller, despite being manufactured by Microsoft, this controller is far less durable than the Xbox 360 controller. I've owned four Xbox 360 controllers for over 10 years and they all still work to this very day with no issues.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I think this controller isn't that much better than the old Xbox 360 controller, and in fact it went back in a few areas.

I use my controllers via Bluetooth on the PC now that Windows 10 allows native Bluetooth connection. I've been getting perhaps 20 hours per set of batteries, which is easily half the life of what I got on 360. It's ridiculous how often I need batteries, to the point that I've had to get a quick-charge pack for my controllers so I stop going through batteries.

Aside from batteries, everything else about the controller is my favorite design in history- just like the 360 controller. I really do think this controller (both of them) are the best console controller ever designed... so long as you don't play games that require ultra-fast D-pad action. The D-pad, just like on 360, is still useless for fighting games. It's fine for menus and puzzle games, but you really have to get an arcade stick for fighting games. The short version is that the D-Pad is raised above the controller and made of one large, round piece of plastic. The best-ever controllers for fighting games hid most of the D-pad under the controller surface and only let the buttons poke through the plastic, ensuring you didn't accidentally roll your thumb against the wrong part of the pad. There's just no way for this D-pad design to equal the older design.

So this is a 5/5 controller for action games an so forth, but it's a 3/5 in terms of battery life and fighting games. I'll average that out to a 4/5. Frankly, if all you want is a great PC game pad, I'd still get an old 360 controller for the battery life. Used 360 controllers will offset the cost of a 360 wireless dongle to allows the pads to work on PC, so you won't lose money on the conversion either.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was frustrated because i couldn't play, so i purchased this controller because it says its by Microsoft and i dont like to use 3rd party controllers for my xbox because i heard they can cause issues, so i got this cause price was excellent but after reading the reviews I decided to request tor cancellation while its on its way to me. I decided that i am just going to shop for a good quality one with good reviews and pay the extra, cause after last nights frustration. I didn't want to take a chance of making it worse in case it sucked or defective according to so many bad reviews. It even has bad reviews on walmart and Microsoft store as well.

Works great, feels a lot better than the non-Bluetooth version.

It’s pretty much plug and play. If you want to remap you need the app, and that’s all it’s good for.

Only problem I have with it is it’s utility with Windows 10. On Xbox You hold the home button for .5 seconds and the prompt comes up asking if you want to turn off the remote or the console, making doing either super easy. On Windows 10 (unless there is another app I am missing) you have to turn the remote off manually by holding the home button for about 10 seconds.

A little annoying but well worth it for being able to connect to my PC without an adapter or plugging in directly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

The seller offered a refund or 50% off immediately. I was so shocked from their decency that I wasn’t even upset anymore.

It has since completely ceased to function, even though it was used with relative infrequency. It was behaving fine for a while, then I went out of town for a week, and when I came back, I immediately encountered problems with it. When I attempt to recharge it, the battery becomes incredibly hot, incredibly fast. It has lost the ability to sync with my Xbox unless it is literally 6 inches away from the system. As soon as I sync it up and move further than 6 inches away, it loses connection. Even when charged (which is a precarious process given the super-heating of the battery) it will randomly just turn itself off with no warning.

Do not purchase this product. If you do, get a warranty. Complete waste of money. I'm so furious I basically just stopped using my Xbox completely rather than dump another 40-50 bucks on a new controller.

That being said...

This thing has some seriously sharp edges where the 2 parts of the mold come together.  It won't cut you but if that sort of tactile sensation bothers you then this controller might drive you mad.

Also the Bluetooth started interfering with the Wifi on my laptop.  My connection goes from 170mb/s to under 100kb/s whenever this bad boy is paired with the laptop.  I don't remember this happening when I first got it so maybe it was a driver update or something.

I try to wait to get the good deals around black Friday and pick-up only equipment made and branded for his XBOX ONE. This controller's description said it was -but when we took it out of the green ""XBOX"" box it looked off. The controller was just a bit smaller then his last one; that this was to replace as ""the same type/style/model"" and it only had ""XBOX"" marked on one small spot. My son was eager to be able to play a new game with his friends so I let my misgivings about it go. I should have shoved that piece of useless junk back into the box and sent it back that day. It didn't take 6 weeks and it was already broken. The left toggle had come loose inside and now it's hangs there limp/broken. Of course this happens just after the time when I ""can't send it back"". last time I order from this  and  beware GAMERS if you play a lot get your gear some were you can go back to for a face to face return.

The fact they only give a 90 day warranty on the product shows their confidence level, clearly didn't mean for them to last.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After a little troubleshooting, we verified that it is indeed the controller and not the headphones causing the issue. I'm not sure if this is a common issue. Hopefully it isn't. And if you're a casual gamer who doesn't need to have a mic, that might not even be a problem.

If you're gonna use it on PC, though, do yourself a favor, and make sure you get the wireless USB adapter for it, too. Besides unlocking all of the controller's features on PC(8 controllers can sync to a single adapter, and you can use the headsets and keyboards designed for the controller), the proprietary wireless signal protocol used is stronger, with a wider band.

What this means is that you'll have more reliable input with less latency, less input lag, and (so far for me) no issues with your character spinning around in-game as if they're possessed because your PC has decided your Bluetooth input from the controller just isn't that high of a priority.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It worked fine for a couple of months, then the L1 button stopped working at all.

I contacted Microsoft and they said that Amazon frequently sells second-hand controllers.  On the item page it says it's from Microsoft, but then it was fulfilled by M&M Gaming.  I see LOTS of other 1-star reviews with issues with their controllers from M&M Gaming.

I had 2 genuine controllers from Microsoft that each lasted over 3 years before having any issues, so I am left to believe that these controllers are either fake, second-hand, or have been tampered with in some fashion.

I ordered this in “NEW” condition meaning I paid the full price expecting a new controller. Come to find out that the controller that was sent was clearly used by someone else and had dried sweat gunk caked into the sides and insides of the controller. The A button was totally mushy and not clicky at all in anyway compared to the rest. As well as the Right Bumper was completely stiff and barely worked. The left stick was also completely worn away even more than my controller of one year of use. I noticed something was up when the package it came in was pretty dirty but I assumed it was because it may have just been sitting somewhere for awhile. I also then realized it after noticing the scratches all over the home button that it was a GEN I controller. This means that it has no headphone jack or bluetooth capability as advertised. I had also assumed that because it was #1 selling on amazon that it would be fine. It doesn’t meantion this “M&M Games” anywhere in the product description for the controller at all untill it’s purchased. Getting a replacement tomorrow hoping that it will be correct this time if indeed foul play was not to blame.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

-1 star for not having an included rechargeable battery pack or usb cable.

I clearly bought the Bluetooth version with the grips and was sent the older version with no Bluetooth. You can tell by the top where the logo is. If it is part of the controller it is Bluetooth,If it is in the same plastic as the top buttons then you got the non Bluetooth version. Make sure you are getting what you paid for. Don't get scammed.

I wuz scammed.

Also something feels off on the older version one they sent me. Hard to explain but it feels like the build quality is terrible compared to my old Xbox 360 controller. The areas where the plastic meet each other feel like they were not put together correctly. They are not smooth and one side feels like it is overlapping too much and almost feels sharp to the touch. I am almost afraid if I get in a tense situation in a game this thing could almost cut the skin. It is really bad at the bottom of the controller. I hate to say it but this thing has knock off build quality. Microsoft should be ashamed if they let these pass quality control checks.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_116?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=116&reviewerType=all_reviews"

At that time, I was still using the controllers that had come with the 360 when I purchased it new. TEN. YEARS! Those things could survive a nuclear holocaust.

As for my Xbox 1 controllers, I have 2 controllers that don’t work so far (replaced the one that came with the Xbox 2 weeks in, and now <4 months in, the replacement is not working). These have not been thrown across the room or stepped on. They have fallen off the couch a few times (and by the way, every single time they do, the battery compartment flies open and the batteries shoot out). Again, we try not to let that happen but it’s not something that should be a problem for a decent controller. The first one, 2 buttons malfunctioned so I can’t even jump in Skyrim (Y button), and the left trigger gets stuck when a loose piece of plastic inside gets lodged underneath it. On my replacement, the right bumper somehow got stuck in the “on” position.

The quality of the Xbox 1 controllers I’ve gotten has been EXTREMELY subpar compared to what I’m used to. Seriously disappointed! And I checked on microsoft’s Support website and they said the one I bought January 1 is out of warranty, so now apparently I have to pay $50 to replace these faulty controllers. For the ridiculous amount of money consoles cost these days, you’d think they would come with good accessories.

I’m not saying don’t buy this, because you’ll probably have the same problem with every controller, but I’m just saying, be prepared to need a new controller every few months because Microsoft only cares about money and (apparently) not customer service or quality control.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

A word of warning to any PC gamers out their buying this for Windows 10, if you pair this over Bluetooth, connect a USB cable, then unplug the cable, the controller will not reconnect to your system. You will have to remove the controller from your Bluetooth devices and then re-pair it. Just a reminder that this controller and the Windows 10 operating system are both Microsoft made products. If this or the OS were third party products then I would give this a 4 star rating, but there's little excuse for something that Microsoft themselves made won't work flawlessly with something else they've made.

The buttons and sticks are way more responsive and smooth than the x-box 360 controller. I don't notice any lag via bluetooth.

I would have given it 5 stars but there are a few cons:

#1 you have to download a microsoft app and update the firmware for it to work properly (which makes no sense to me).

#2 it consumer batteries quickly. For this price it should be recharable via usb.

#3 the audio jack doesn't work via bluetooth. I assume this is to cut down on lag maybe, but I really don't see why they couldn't have made it work.

Also, the app microsoft made for this thing really sucks and remapping the buttons is a giant pain in the butt.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Microsoft doesn't care anymore.","March 14, 2019","Microsofts Xbox 360 controllers were seemingly indestructible. They lasted for years and years, offering seemingly endless hours of play time and could even take pretty heavy abuses such as being thrown HARD on a concrete floor (I was rough with mine as a teen, something I have grown out of). These XBOX ONE controllers are extremely poor quality in comparison. The joysticks fail extremely fast. It's a bummer because the overall shape and redesigned triggers were a great modification from the 360's. The only problem really is the joysticks. You could look at them wrong and they will start to ""drift"" affecting your ability to play and enjoy your games. Your character will walk on their own without you even touching the controller after only a few months play time it seems. My first controller that came with my console lasted less than 4 months before it was causing serious interruption to proper movement in game. My next two each lasted about 6 months before developing the same issues. Aim and movement are key to pretty much any game. The controller will just endlessly scroll through ""windows"" in game on their own. This is a serious fail on Microsoft's part, especially seeing how Battle Royale style games have become increasingly popular during the XBOX ONE's lifetime, requiring near constant movement. These controllers should be cut down to half price because generic knock-offs at less than half the price are outperforming and outliving these controllers. It's sad, I still have a half dozen xbox 360 controllers that can still function better than these Xbox One controllers. Microsoft, if you design another controller ever again, remember to make it DURABLE, and nobody wants your extra fancy $160 Elite controllers, how asinine can you get?","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

One thing to keep in mind is that the battery included is AA and its not rechargeable, I expected it to be but its not a big issue because it has a very  long batter life, you can also wire it which doesn't require any battery and will get power from the cable (micro USB, the samsung charger) so if you don't want to  use it wirelessly you can just use a cable you have at home or get one for the appropriate length for your use (3-5ft cables isn't that expensive compared to the wireless adapter by microsoft). that's that my only drawback, the batteries are not rechargeable, but other than that its has no problem","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But one very annoying problem I'm having with mine is that the X button seems worn out a little bit already. I got it 1 or 2 days ago, but I noticed it pretty much immediately. Sometimes it's not noticeable, but anytime I have to repeatedly press X it sometimes feels like the button just doesn't want to come up; there's a slight delay that, while it doesn't affect my gameplay, it does get quite frustrating to always be wondering if it's going to happen again. That's why I still give it a 4/5. It still works and functions as it's supposed to, just a bit annoying to deal with that.

Update: 4 months later the right bumper is starting to crap out. It clicks but seemingly randomly won't register it. Kinda sucks to have such a mediocre life span but I can't say it didn't do its job for that time so there's that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/product-reviews/B01LPZM7VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"
