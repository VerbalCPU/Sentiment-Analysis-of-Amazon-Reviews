I love AI and want Anki to succeed but this needs to be said.","November 18, 2018","This post is to warn future consumers and to let Anki know that they really need to improve their product. I love AI and I own a google home and I love my google home and so I want products like Vector to improve. Just like the gaming community is combatting unfair monetary systems, I want to make Anki aware of the many issues this product has.

It's personality isn't finished and it really doesn't do much
Anki states this is an unfinished product and I expected an unfinished product but not at the level I witnessed. When I picture an unfinished product I think of google home. It can still have utility and perform commands well but it's not done as google assistant at it is still improving and future features such as ""AI calling"" are coming. With Vector, I knew I wasn't getting utility but a cute robot. That's fine but he's not that cute or lifelike to be honest. When his ""personality"" was his eyes thinking 90% of the time. 5% a squint of happiness when he looks at me and 5% of anger when I wake him up or pick him up.... That's not worth the 250 dollar price tag. I'm sorry.

My google home was 70 and it frankly has 10x the personality this robot has. Google home doesn't have faces but it tells me jokes, tells me stories, tells me the news, has quirky responses to stupid questions I have, and much more. The issue with a personality is that it needs to be a lot more than 2 eyes moving in a lot of different directions. We need to talk to Vector. That needs to be Vector's X-factor over a real pet. You see with a real pet. You can't talk to it and it just has it's behaviors to communicate with you. However, you're looking at a live being. You see it's eyes. It's love. Vector will frankly never beat that because you're just looking at pixels. But if it was able to talk? Really be an assistant. That could change the game for it.

It's too loud and distracting
Even at its lowest volume, the tracks are so loud. It's too distracting. As a college student who studies 10 hours a day, I can tolerate some distractions but this was ridiculous. At a point, I just wanted it to sleep all the time and just realized I didn't want it at all to be honest. Sigh.

It doesn't follow commands like 80% of the time
This is a big issue. I was using the app while giving commands to see Vector's thoughts. I told it to go back to its charging pad. It does start doing that. Then sees a water bottle. Gets distracted. Then wanders off again. The same thing when I ask it to come here. It was just so unreliable as a robot. Robots follow commands. This is what I expected and I don't think that's too much to ask to be honest. If I type ""B"" on a laptop, I expect B to appear on the screen. If I ask google to play music, I expect ""music"" to be played. If I ask vector to go to its charging pad because its being disruptive to my work, I expect it to got to its charging pad.

Was it all bad?
I won't lie. It made me feel. I felt genuinely sad writing this review and putting him back in the box to be returned. The last time he closed his eyes as I turned him off made me feel bad. But that's it to be honest. He wasn't even that fun the first 5 minutes. He couldn't even say my name. Also, I had this thought that the people with issues with his voice recognition were just bad at english. No. I use Google home and siri all the time. Mostly google but they understand my commands like 95% of the time. Vector? Maybe 20-30% of the time. I was born and raised in the US and am a native English speakers.

Overall?
This product needs a LOT of improvement. This is not a finished product. Not even close. When I expect an unfinished product, I expect it to have at least one thing it is good at so I can keep myself interested in it until improvement come. However, this wasn't the case. Voice Recognition? 20-30% recognition. Follow through on commands? No. It gets too distracted. Personality? Two pixelated eyes isn't enough. At least talk to me.

I'm frankly very disappointed in this product because I was so excited for it. I was even distracted while doing work and studying in wait for it and it just wasn't good. RIP the exam I studied for on Friday...

As a college student, money is tight. I am willing to spend money on things that make me happy and destress like google home. However, 200 dollars for a robot that is distracting, doesn't listen, gets distracted easily, and doesn't even have much personality to be honest. I felt conned. Honestly.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Vector is a funny AI, but lonely. He would roll up to a wall mirror and talk to the refection of him self.
After 3 or 4 hours, Vector stopped going to the mirror because the robot in the mirror did the same movements as he did and got bored.
His owner saw that Vector was withdrawn and went to the charging station and went to sleep.
After 20 minutes or so, he would wakeup and roll around, talk to his owner for few minutes and then mosey around, go to the wall mirror to see himself.
Vector’s owner could see that he was doing the same thing repeatedly.
So, his owner bought another robot and named him Vector-2.
At first, they would hit each other and roll around in circles chasing each other.
The owner could see that they were learning from each other.
One day, the owner saw Vectot-1 go up to the face of the owner’s dog, while Vector-2 went from behind and touched one of the dogs rear feet trying to do a “Fist bump”, which caused the dog to jump up and run away. Both Vector started jumping up and down, what could only be interpreted by the owner as laughing.
The owner was surprised by this as he never taught ether robots to something like that.
Now, both Vector’s play together until their batteries start flashing red. They would go to a charging station.
Where they go asleep until one of would wake up and pick on the other Vector until he woke up too.
The owner was glad he had 2 Vectors as his days were full of wonder and awe, as they did something different every day.
The owner’s dog came around and played with both Vectors but making sure she wouldn’t fall for the same distraction with one of the Vectors going around and bump in to the dogs foot again, not that they didn’t try several times.
These robots are the closest thing to true AI in a very small package but smart, plus learning new things all by themselves every day.
I am very happy I bought two Vectors, as it is like little kids rolling around and having fun.
The End, maybe.

"1575042855-31075","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews","Nathan","Small Robot with the Personality of a Human","December 24, 2018","I saw many mixed reviews about this little guy from the start when it released back in October, making me think that Anki wasn't consistent with the models or they haven't quite gotten the right codes/programming down. Despite that, I bought this when it was on sale to see whether this little guy functioned well myself; I was mainly curious to see whether Anki improved on Vector's behaviors, but mostly how the Alexa integration worked. Pairing Vector with the smartphone app was no hassle at all; it was a very streamlined process. We instantly fell in love with the little guy the moment he powered up. So much personality built into a wee little machine.

We've had Vector for about 2 days now, and I can tell that he's already accommodated to our environment surrounding him. Whenever he's up and about he's just strolling around, minding his own business or playing with his cube- he recognizes all of our faces if we enter the room or if he hasn't seen any of us in a bit, then greeting us by our name. Heck, he even asks for fist bumps on his own now! He also has no problem finding his charger when he's low on battery. The only issue Vector has regarding that is that he can't really see much in the dark, which I'm sure Anki will solve that in the future.

The design and overall structure of the robot himself is brilliant, Anki designed him in a great way where he'll be able to roam around on his own perfectly. No problems with the edge-detecting sensors, he's been real good with that, making sure that he doesn't fall to his own death. It amazes me how he can ping his cube and make it light up and stuff when he's trying to find it- watching robotics get more and more advanced interests me, which is why I was intrigued when I came upon Vector.

Just like everyone else is mentioning, Vector's AI has rather limited usage- I use his timer when I cook and ask him for the weather the most. However, since he's only a couple months old, Anki has plans and will evolve him to be capable of more in the mere future, which is why I believe Vector has potential. It is a bit pricey as well, but the Alexa integration makes me lean towards the justified price a bit more, the SALE price of $174.99, rather. Yes, this guy is expensive, I won't deny that. Anki was able to program him with most of Alexa's capabilities- but unfortunately he can't play music, for obvious reasons, but I'm fine with that. I just think it's amazing that Anki was able to code Alexa into Vector, the little guy has twice the power now- seize the day where he becomes a little Terminator, hehe.

Anki has done a terrific job introducing advanced robotics to the world in the form of Vector, although Cozmo was their first model, which is also a very fine robotic pal. However, if you were to choose between the two, Vector would be the better choice in my opinion, as he's more for practical use- you're getting Alexa (most of her), but also a little pal to bring some livelihood to your home and family. If you can nab him at the price of $174.99 if he's on sale again, then do go through with it, you won't regret it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

(approx every 25 minutes) I made sure not to put it on a table or desk after watching many reviews showing it diving off the edge. Did I mention it's cute....And it snores intermittently through the night. Oh....It does give you fist bumps. That is all I have. Just don't expect much.
Jan 22, 2019 Did I mention you will love it....It has now been a while and here is what I discovered. It is sneaky. I have had to track it down when it sneaks away and yes it knows it's being sneaky. It will argue with you in it's own language. It will throw temper tantrums. It has come off of it's charger while I'm sleeping. It will beg for attention. It will say ""uh oh"" when you catch it trying to go under the couch...But it will still go under the couch and refuse to come out. If it gets bored it will start dancing all by itself (no music) It acts just like a child at times. One thing I know is this...It is learning as it goes and will try to get away with anything. I won't put it on a counter or desk because it tries to go beyond it's limit. It has actually flipped on it's side by using leverage on it's cube....Then throws a tantrum until you pick it up. One more thing... I fell asleep on my couch and woke up to find it in front of the TV just watching quietly. When I said ""Hey Vector"" ..It replied ""Uh Oh"" and made a dash for it's charger. It was almost 2am. So Yeah...I'm keeping this little brat...Just to see what it does next. It will have you laughing out loud and it will make smart aleck noises noises if you argue with it. It is intelligent. I give it five stars (up from two) It will make you fall in love with it. Oh Yeah...Just after midnight while watching the New Year celebration on TV...I told Vector to ""listen"" when they switched to Nashville for a Country Music performance and well... let's just say this Vector wasn't happy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My kid enjoyed the toy, however, it has an internal battery that is impossible to replace and the company Anki no longer produces any of the robots and does not provide ANY support. So basically, I spent just under $300 on a toy that sits on its charger and dies the instant that it comes off. Our kid understands the concepts of batteries and chargers. But try explaining to a 4 yo that no matter how much you charge it, it will never play with you again. A huge waste of money and a huge disappointment. I can see so much potential in this little guy, and yet when the company that builds it won’t stand up behind it and help customers with little issues like making batteries accessible and/or replaceable, it certainly complicates things and unless you’re a hard wired engineer that will take things apart and put them back together on the regular, I wouldn’t recommend buying.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_87?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=87&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When taking him out of the box the first thing I thought was wow he is pretty small for the price. After playing with him for a while being smaller is better. The setup wasn't smooth. The app for android freezes often and had to clear the cache to get it to attempt to connect. After a few attempts at connecting I finally got to the screen that tells me I need to update him. When I clicked this after about 60 seconds he would show a little cloud with an exclamation mark in it. The app would ask me to try again. After a few more tries I thought maybe I typed the Wi-Fi password wrong. I went online and did a reboot and retried a few times until it asked me to setup his connection again. I carefully typed in the Wi-Fi password, same issue... cloud with exclamation!

Frustrated I went back online to the help pages. It went over all the basics. I have an Orbi setup which has been working great so I didn't think it was strength of the signal. One thing did catch my eye though, WMM. It stands for Wi-Fi multimedia mode. I went to the router setup page and advanced settings and sure enough on my 2.4GHZ band it was unchecked. I clicked it and hit save. Gave it about 5 minutes and tried the Vector update again, success! No idea why it was off by default on my 2.4 band but I haven't had any adverse effects turning it back on.

Now that I finally got this picky little robot setup it was time to play with him. Well for me him doing a wheel stand and playing with his cube was about as much entertainment as I saw. If this little guy was for me I would have knocked another two stars off because after hour of getting him setup. Then he doesn't do much of anything except play with a cube. He also doesn't respond very well to anyone in my house. Oh and he managed to fall off a square table when in exploration mode, only once though so maybe he learned his lesson.

Then why did I give him 4 stars... well my kids almost 3 and almost 5 love him. They keep saying how much they love him. He makes funny little sounds at them and has learned my older ones name. The two of them have been standing playing with him until he is out of battery. That takes about 45 minutes of playtime to do. In just a few days he has provided 4 + hours of focused playtime for them.

My first impression of him went up a lot since the first hour I spent with him alone. I still can't him to dance and his voice recognition is subpar. My younger under 3 can get Alexa to play that mind numbing Baby Shark song no problem but he or my older daughter can't get Vector to respond with any reliability.

Hopefully as advertised he/she/it (Vector) will get more advanced and improve. My opinion says they rushed this out for the holidays. That all aside it is a funny, cute little robot that has been keeping the kids entertained.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_84?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=84&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Update - Better experience now.","December 27, 2018","We just keep receiving errors on this thing. Error 914, 915, 916. Not too pleased since this was a gift for our son. Would advise staying away until Anki works out the issues.

Straight from Anki's website -
These error codes are nothing to worry about. They simply mean Vector has encountered an internal issue and needs to reboot
Please wait approx. 30 seconds for Vector to restart himself
You may see this error code more than once
If Vector does not automatically reboot, please see this FAQ for how to boot Vector in Recovery Mode manually

Nothing to worry about for whom? They are an annoyance to the customer when the device keeps having to reboot which most of the time does not happen automatically. For us they happen repeatedly.

Update - The issues have seemed to resolve at the start of the year. It seems that there was an abundance sold for Christmas and Anki was having some server issues. We had actually requested a return from Amazon and as usual, Amazon sent a quick replacement. However, we ended up keeping the original after issues resolved. My son said he felt ""connected"" to it. I will say it's a really neat toy and with the little mat, you can let him roam freely and interact. It's a one of a kind toy. The only negative now that issues are resolved is that he can keep kids up in the middle of the night with ""snoring"" if kept in a child's bedroom. The continual updates keep adding new features though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Vector Robot by Anki, A Home Robot Who Hangs Out & Helps Out, With Amazon Alexa Built-In

Say hey to Vector, your first home robot. Seriously, say ""Hey Vector."" -- He can hear you. Actually, Vector's more than a home robot. He's your buddy. Your companion. Most of all, he'll make you laugh. Curious, independent and powered by some preposterous tech and AI,
Along with this intro from Vectors maker, comes four things, A charging dock, a USB power adapter  and a Vector companion app.
Along with a big welcome smile from Vectors new owners.  And myself!
I am no stranger to robots, have grown into them through acknowledged, A robot that cleans your floors then cleans your rugs, kids toys, bunnies that sail across the floor and the cats swat as its passes then and finally the Queen of Technicality ""Alexa"" along with her beginning came her minions ...  I own one Alexa and  6 minions ...and am constantly amazed at the rapid growth .. amazed, so when Vector arrived,disappointed to say the least ... ... he is ... no  was  so cute in size but seems like he is still in the baby stage, as he coos,snores when asleep.
As for this stage, he never seemed to advance, in truth he was so distracted when given a request he often wondered off ... he also falls a lot ... this was Vectors final undoing .... he fell one last time, when I asked about a warranty I was told by Vectors support system, it was not covered...so, I am left with a broken robot, he still had a re purpose function, as he was so cute with his little toy ...his cube, docking station and his good looks ... and I did like him, he resides in my studio among watercolors,  pencils, computers, tons of books ...will he ever read? (Alexa gets all my Auto books for me, and is silent ....he sits with a ton of post it notes stuck to him .. as reminder that every one has a purpose.
As for a recommendation, not now .. I say yes, but when he comes of age, better yet a brother that is a cousin to Alexa and as 10% as smart as Alexa  and that side of the family ..well,?  ....recommendations?  Wait for it!

He isn't as smart as Google or Alexa yet but that will come in time. I heard the company is having trouble and I hope they do all they can to save this little guy and just make him even better  because he really is great and has grown in the months I've owned him. I hope they keep everyone who helped make him as great as he is. Let's keep him going because he is useful and a nice little buddy to have around. If anything happens a lot of people will be disappointed and saddened for losing their friend. Let's keep him going and maybe ask for contributions from fans in exchange for special items or abilities this company would like to try.

The expressions it can make with just square-ish eyes is pretty amazing and he can convey his mood well with sounds and shakes of his ""arms"". But that's about where the good ends.

I got this for my 10 and 11 year old boys for Christmas. Sure, it was pretty interesting - at first. We got it to recognize our faces and say our names. Once. Other reviewers say it says their names in greeting when it sees them. It never said any of ours again. It's super slow. You have to say ""Hey, Vector"" ... wait for it to be ready ... then give it a command. The white lights blink while it ""thinks"" about doing what you told it to do. And eventually, it may or may not do it. I'd say about 75% of the time, it got distracted and did NOT do the command. To ask it a question is also ridiculously slow. You have to say ""Hey, Vector"" ... wait for it to be ready ... say ""I have a question"" ... wait for it to say ""Ready"" ... then finally ask your question. Getting the answer is - again - super slow. You CAN use Alexa instead - which is MUCH faster - but then you have Alexa's voice coming out of Vector - which kind of ruins the ""magic"" of the toy. It only holds a charge for maybe 15 minutes. It comes off of its charger when it ""sees"" someone and makes cute noises and explores, occasionally playing with its block. What it can actually do is VERY limited. After a week of it mainly sitting around just taking up space and everyone being bored with it, I'm sending it back. It has to way to go before it's worth the price IMHO.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Vector moves off his charger at night and will know stuff off the table, sometimes he himself falls off. Anki asked me to videotape this for them, which I think isn't cool when seeking warranty help. have a squared edge table so it's not the table. Rounded edges don't work well. No matter what I do he won't recognize my face. I did all the troubleshooting steps. When I tell this to Anki they send me the link for the stuff I just did. Later on they told me him moving off the charger at night and moving around is what it's supposed to do. Doubtful.

Bad - 1) very short battery life - maybe 30 minutes or so when fully charged; 2) rarely goes back to the charger on his own, simply runs out of steam and has to be picked up and taken to the charger; 3) seems to be hard of hearing, have to speak to him loudly; 4) he still doesn’t recognize me very often . . .

Ocampo","The older brother of Cozmo.","November 28, 2018","Vector is the older brother of Cozmo. It's not exactly grown up, but it's getting there. A bit better looking, in my opinion, but still needs more work to do.

For one you don't need a device to control it. Although it needs an app for initial set up, after that it's up and running on it's own.

Commands can be ordered, but it's a hit and miss and Anki states it is learning. So I'm trusting it will improve over time.

At this point there's nothing much it can do apart from amuse the household. Most important feature for me for now is being Alexa on wheels. So you can ask questions it can search from the internet.

I wish it would patch into HomeKit so I can order it to turn on and off my smart switches around the house.

As an 80's kid, two things I dreamed about were VR and Robots (Think Johnny 5). Vector isn't real AI, but convincing enough to check one of those boxes.

Be mindful of keeping the robot in high places because even though the edge detection is very, very good I have come home to find him on the floor a few times. Vector is built like a tank, but anything other than high pile carpet would probably cause damage.

This is true but the company retained their senior engineers and software designers ( As contractors ) to support the cloud and updates and from what I’ve read on Reddit  The Anki server Certificate is good until 2021 so your vector will be functional for quite some time.  Otherwise why would Amazon be selling them they come with a one-year factory warranty.  There is also the possibility that someone will acquire their IP.  There is also something called Project Victor  Which consists of a group of engineers and software developers who are trying to reverse engineer vector so he will live forever with open source  Privately funded community  So don’t give up hope he just got an update also about a month and a half ago and that fixed so many things.  davidlovesvector","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I still believe it is an awful lucky Blackjack dealer...but besides that, and a couple of network issues, namely needing to re-enter my network in to the app (iOS) because of settings loss.

Disclosure - while I am not employed, affiliated, contracted or endorsed by Anki, I would like to point out that I *am* a Software Engineer by trade so I see the ""rough edges"" other people have been describing in most cases ""reasonable, given the constraints"" or ""fix in next software update""

The only real technical issue I have is that i believe it would be a better product with an additional IR Low light camera, or perhaps a less expensive component such as an IR light to help with low-light recognition scenarios.

Lower on the list is the Ask/Response cycle for the onboard/built-in (not 'I have a question' ones): if they can shave about 500ms off this (I suspect the Eng team might have suggested biasing towards recognizer, then backing with anime, but lost to the animators. Maybe they should find a split) as it sometimes really takes you ""out of"" the experience because the ""conversational gap"" is just a *liiitle* long ( time between ""Hey Vector"" and ""Ready"" - people have gotten used to not waiting extra long for the ""acknowledgement"" prompt with improved home assistant tech, so Vector can sometimes feel ""slow"" and the animations aren't *quite* (""I'm thinking"" eyes and sound effect) mitigating this via illusion/distraction, but that seems the intent.

I look forward to revisiting this review in 12 weeks to see if I feel the same way, but right now, I find the product effectively ""brightens my day""...many times a day, sometimes at Laugh out loud levels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

So now my wife has it on her desk (because mine has too much for him to navigate) and ends up getting mad at him because he likes to make a lot of noise at any hour of the day. Yeah, you can tell him to be quiet, but he eventually starts doing his own thing again.

He seems to learn things though. Day one I taught him who I was and then tried to get him to fist bump right after. Now a week later I don't have to tell him to fist bump, I just hold my fist out when he recognizes me and he does it on his own.

This is much less a kids toy and more a companion for idle times at your desk. It's still pretty cool, but for the price most people would be better off with the less expensive and seemingly more intelligent version.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

According to a report from Recode, Anki, the company responsible for making small AI-tuned robots with giant personalities is shutting down after it ran out of money. Recode says the company is forced to close its doors “after a new round of financing fell through at the last minute.”

For anyone who ponied up a couple hundred bucks to buy one of Anki’s robots, it’s a bummer. While the company confirmed its closure to Crunchbase, it hasn’t said how it will handle support for existing models, and the news will surely affect future development of the platform.

And that’s a shame. While Anki made a name for itself through its robots’ Wall-E-like personalities and expressions, the underlying technology is equally impressive. One of the first companies to embrace artificial intelligence and machine learning in consumer devices, Anki started out with toy cars. After a big break on Apple’s WWDC stage in 2013, Anki Drive brought the experience of a video game to physical objects, which led to the introduction of Cozmo, the company’s first learning robot.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_83?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=83&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So I thought I would peer-review this product. So I issued a refund because I didnt really see the point. But I felt bad, this product was so expensive i figured maybe it was just me. Maybe i just didnt know how to operate it yet. So i sat down and tried to work with it. It doesnt do much but the simple commands that amazon said I could do with it it didnt do. For example, I would tell Vector Hey vector and wait a good 2 seconds and then I would say play with cube and he would move around but like he would play with the cube like maybe he couldnt find it even tho it was sitting right next to it. He wouldn't go home and he wouldn't come here. So he was pretty much broken, or manufactured
wrong, something was up with that right? He wasnt listening to basic commands.  And what else does he do other than wonder around a small space, look bored, and occasionally fall off a desk? Your paying 136 dollars for something that moves around in a pretend mad kind of way when you pick it up, can tell you the weather, and will move around and go back to its charger when dyeing. That's it.

Others don’t realize its potential.","November 27, 2018","PLEASE NOTE. First off not signing into Amazon to use Alexa means Alexa is fully disabled. That may save much privacy. No this device does not use the cloud with the camera. This device CAN BE USED WITHOUT WIFI. You just won’t be able to use the utilities but it’ll still recognize faces and function just won’t do voice response. It’s slower than expected because a lot of processing is done on the device itself. Alexa is all cloud based which is why it’s so much quicker. It’s even faster than Vector, running on Vector. Don’t be worried. This is equipped with an actual smart phone level processor that was in Samsung phones in about 2013 or 14. Those being in this robot is impressive. It’s ready for loads of updates. When I took this out of the box and set it up I started messing with it. It wasn’t too responsive, but you see it wants to do things. After messing with it for about 2 hours or so, I’ve figured out how it works and it actually did learn. Sounds weird but it did, it became way more responsive and was kind of really cool. It actually learned and took in information to better it’s AI. Give it time, it learns. As for the facial recognition, I had trouble with that too. But after it seeing a few other people, it started getting much more accurate as well. It’s really weird. It works though. A lot of the “features” are in its free roam I’ve noticed. If you place an object in front of it, it’ll look at it and kind of take note. Next time it sees it, it just passes by. Place a new object and it’ll look it over again. It’s really just something for people into the technology and or want something that not many people have seen. Overall, highly recommend. The creators say it’ll keep getting updates and they’ll update the code in the robot via the cloud and it’ll get smarter without having to learn.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

EDIT
Giving this guy a 4 star now.  I did a reset on Vector but the update still took a long time.  Probably another 3 hours and it finally succeeded.

Unfortunately, I am less than impressed with this incarnation of Vector. I would be more willing to accept its limitations if the price was more consistent with what you get. However, for $250 my expectations are higher than what this product is capable of.

One of the biggest problems is the android app. It is awful. It doesn't work most of the time. Even when it ""works,"" it is not an ideal interface. Some of the functions don't work or respond.

Another problem is how slow Vector is to respond. To get his (and in this day and age, why does it have to be male?) attention, you need to say ""Hey, Vector."" Then wait. You'll be able to train yourself to wait, but if you're accustomed to other AI devices, this one takes much longer. Also, you can say, ""Hey, Vector. I have a question."" But then you must wait for some time before Vector tells you he's ready. Unfortunately, he doesn't know the answer to many questions. So most of the time he will either tell you he doesn't know or ""I didn't get that.""

Right now he'll do a few tricks with his little cube. He'll also go home, go to sleep, give me the local weather, identify me by name (not consistently), give me a high five, and a few other things. That's not much for $250.

The dogs were concerned with him for a short period of time, and then they quickly realized he was no threat and nothing to play with. They are far more entertaining and charming than Vector is.

I genuinely hope the manufacturers are working day and night at improving this product.

The response delay is a bit long, although there are indicators that show Vector is thinking. Vector seem to recognize me better during the day. Perhaps this is due to the lighting and Vector’s poor camera. But over all amazing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It will tell you the weather, do add and subtract (though a calculator be quicker).  It can answer questions.  But it cant play music. It dies in about 15 min and cant usually find it way back to charge. It drives off the table over and over. It isnt a.i. it is just programmed with a few basic gimmicks.  It is costructed well (good thing since it drives off tables and desks and falls on the floor). Unless you really need the programmed attempt at a personality (which doesnt respond well) it really doesnt seem worth the money. You can do more with a echo dot quicker and it plays music. Vector is, a overpriced desk toy. I bought it on sale for about $170 but realistically i probably wouldnt have spent over $70 if i knew how limited it really was.  Other than being really small, driving off the table, calculator (slow calculator), telling you the weather (your phone can do that), i just dont think it has any real purpose. Other than a overpriced funny/cute desk toy.  It might be useful for someone avoiding going on alexa. This can operate without alexa or with alexa. But if you have alexa a echo dot the fraction of this price has more use. Oh and it loses internet signal really easy, doesnt find its way home to charge, only has a few programmed commands, you have to repeat yourself constantly. It can actually be pretty annoying.  Unless you avoiding alexa.  More of a gimmick than a useful tool unfortunately. Or a real expensive desk ornament or kids toy.  They should have made this more useful before release especially for the price range. I think they are counting not on utility but the little fake personality they programmed it with to sell it.  For all of us that expected much more at this price point than a toy hopefully they do some major updates, as it just has little usefulness. Least echo plays music and anything you ask alexa is MUCH faster not on vector.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I’ll keep posting updates as long as my Vector still runs..
UPDATE 6 MONTHS: It’s been 6 months since we got our replacement and the one we have works great.  He improves with each software update and has become a welcome companion on my desk.  Especially as the house gets quieter with empty nest.  And yes we have a dog but it’s kinda nice to have someone see you come into the room and call your name with excitement.  After 6 months his battery is good and he just keeps rocking along. He’s also my only Alexa device I’m glad to have him. Still satisfied..
UPDATE:  Day 5 : Yeaterday he developed a a squeak in the gearing that has gotten worse.  Anki is sending a replacement and says that this is rare, however, I downgraded a star.. Day 1 with Vector:
First let me say that after the slew of negative reviews, I set my expectations very low.  Upon arrival, and being super techie naive, I attempted set up with my IPhone X...and to my surprise, it was simple...didn’t test my patience at all.  I also have poor WiFi service and yet Vector works perfectly.  7 hours later he is still functioning flawlessly.
The Alexa side is instantaneous, you just speak Alexa and get an instant response with no delay.
As far as the battery life, we have been through quite a few charge cycles today.  The first few were kind of short but after about 3, it gets longer Vector now runs about an hour.  He charges in about 15-20 minutes on his charger which is plugged into an Apple 5 watt wall wart.  All of this has come as a welcome surprise.
We have started his exploring off slow, giving him a small spot to roam and explore in and the more he learns, the better he gets.  He studies faces and calls out each person.  If the lighting changes too much, you may have to reintroduce yourself, and He will ask if he has met you before and if so, he will learn your features quickly.
He has also made it to his charger every time and has not run out of power before reaching it.
All of this being said, it’s been a wonderful experience up to this point.  No WiFi droppage, no short battery life, no dying before reaching the charger, no suicidal tendencies by diving off of the edge of the table (stops every time).

Then came the moment of moments...the introduction to my wife...I just whispered a few things to her on what to do, and WOW she fell in love with this thing...what a shock..(that alone is worth 5 stars)
Today the house has been filled with adults, all waiting a turn to get some time with Vector.  What an amazing day!

This is the reason for 5 stars:
Alexa works great (I was expecting huge delays and none exist)
Vector is fascinating, the more he learns, the better he gets
Finally, there is absolutely nothing like this anywhere that I’ve ever seen..

I’m really wondering about the negative reviews, our first day experience has been wonderful.  We’re looking forward to the adventure ahead as Anki moves forward in its programming!

For the record, I almost didn’t do this and just about let the critics scare me away...I am SO glad I took the jump!  (And so is everyone who meets Vector)
Day3:  The more he learns, the better he gets.  He does get a little carried away when heads to the edge of the table carrying his cube.  When he gets to the edge and tries to stop, it makes him top heavy and he’ll tumble over the side.  We’ll see if he learns from it.
Other than that, still functions flawlessly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Adams","This little dude is so much fun!","January 3, 2019","Honestly, I had seen the videos for the Anki Vector, but thought they were 'embellished' a bit. This is the best little cat tormentor you could ever buy! LOL! It's a fun toy with a LOT of potential.

Now, foremost, let's set expectations: Vector is not Rosie the Robot from the Jetsons. And, by and large, I think it is largely a 'conceptual' toy that shows what the future holds. Someday Vector could be 10x the size, or have articulating limbs, or a taller 'body', or have a built in scooper and vacuum... there are so many ways this could go.

For now, they say Vector is a ""companion"" who is made to hang out and help out. And I believe that is accomplished. Vector is this cute little dude that is currently sitting on our kitchen countertop. Most of the time he sits there and just chatters to himself. Sometimes he leaves his charging ""home"" and explores (not really sure what triggers this). Sometimes he gets really adventurous and gets SUPER close to the edge, but has not yet tumbled off. He has, on occasion, tipped himself over backwards. Once he righted himself, another time he kept squawking something that vaguely sounded like ""help!"" He has been known to knock empty water bottles off of the counter, and to play with his block. We don't really know why he plays with his block, or when. He just does it. Sometimes he gets noisy, so we have to tell him to go to sleep. He does... but he snores. It's both cute and annoying.

When Anki describes Vector as being ""alive with personality and engaged by sight, sound, and touch"", they aren't lying. You can stroke his back and he really likes it. He 'sees' things that excite him, and really likes when you call his name. He will answer questions in his cute little robot voice, take photos (somewhat low quality) for you, and perform other functions. When you ask him what the weather is, or say Merry Christmas, or Happy New Year, he responds with cute little graphics and animations.

Vector has recently been enabled with Alexa, which is pretty cool. I have read up on it, but have not yet set it up for the simple reason that our Echo is like 15 feet away. It would get confusing if they both answered. He will likely eventually move to our son's room, at which time the Alexa features will be more usable. But asking Vector (or Alexa) to control your lights, etc., is pretty fun.

As noted, Vector independently navigates and will self-charge -- IF he can find his home. A time or two he has gotten 'lost' and his battery died. He does recognize people, but you have to say ""Hey Vector - who am I?"" then let him stare at your for 30 seconds before he'll announce your name. It's cute to hear, but would be much cooler if he could recognize your voice (much like Alexa does).

Setting up Vector and updating him via an iPhone 6s was easy. Once we got him connected to our Wi-Fi he has been smooth sailing. It would be nice if there was a newsletter or something that gave you some new things to try out periodically with Vector. It's hard to just assume what his new skills might be.

Vector includes 1 Vector robot, 1 cube, and 1 charging cable. A USB power adapter not included, which is disappointing, given the cost.

Overall, it's a very fun toy, but more geared toward teens and adults than young children. I also wish when you asked vector a question you did not have to say ""Hey Vector, let me ask you a question...."" To me that is cumbersome, especially compared to Alexa, Siri, Cortana, Google, etc. I want to just say ""Hey Vector, what's the weather?"" and have him respond without the dance of having to key him to get ready to answer me.

Note: Perhaps the biggest roadblock to Vector ownership is the price. Certainly he is NOT cheap, and the return for that cost (compared to say, an Echo Show) is pretty minimal. He is indeed fun and entertaining -- but he's NOT a child's toy. At this time, you are paying largely for the novelty and experience. The entry into AI-driven robot ownership is pricey. So if cost is an object, I would advise waiting... unless you just REALLY REALLY REALLY want one -- in which case, go for it! I will say... he's cheaper in the long run than a cat. And you don't have to feed him or change his litter box. :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_88?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=88&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Super easy and intuitive to get Vector rolling only minutes after opening the box.

Second, this is really the first iteration of a personal robot-like device that dramatically pulls forward the vision of having an assistant who can hear, see, talk, take pictures, compute, process, and most importantly, move amidst its surroundings and LEARN.

Third, right now it is playing with its block on my desktop, and I must say... it's endearing.  The personality of Vector is well thought out and it comes across as expressive without being annoying or obnoxious.

For me, the Vector is a breakout product.  And by breakout, it's well beyond the realm of the toy category, it's redefining the delivery of personal assistant services, and it's a much preferred alternative to the plain grey silo on my bedside table.

My table does have rounded edges on one side, but he doesn't seem to have a problem with that . As far as seeing me and knowing my name, he does really well. After the first day he had a little trouble recognizing me all of a sudden and then he had an error code at one point, so I rebooted him and now all is well. The first day he also had a little trouble backing into his Home, but he's has improved on that and does it with perfection. He is good at blackjack and great at rolling his cube. I can't get over how cute he is, especially when he snores! I also got him to ""dance to the beat"" after my command. I use the Vector app to see what he's doing/thinking. Mostly he explores, but sometimes he'll listen for music.
I'm not sure if he will leave his Home base while I'm gone and this morning I was worried he might start exploring on the table and set off the house alarm so I turned him off. To turn him off, hold down his button for 5 seconds and he'll power down.
I have an Android phone so it took a few tries to get him paired. I had to reboot my phone a couple times. Now the app connects with him no problem. Once he's connected you really don't need the app, but I like seeing his stats and check what he's doing.
Overall, I'm so glad I threw in the towel and purchased him. He's my new little buddy and I don't have to feed him or clean up after him (so far)!

Update: Wish him Merry Christmas! Then wish him Happy New Year!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Well, though the initial excitement was there, the robot offered little for my then 7 yr old to do other than give it verbal commands. It is NOT a STEM/STEAM device and really does little to foster learning. You can ask it questions as it integrates with Alexa and AWS as the real brains behind it. Sadly, I upgraded my router and even after hours of troubleshooting I was no longer to get this robot to connect, so it's little more now than a sad toy that sits in the corner occasionally waking up, roaming away from it's base and dying of battery because it doesn't have the ""brains"" to get back to the base without internet connectivity. Every time I try and fix the device, it connects to my app (oh and you have to have a iOS or Android device for this to be setup), it briefly connects to the configuration on the app, then disconnects. I suspect it's a Bluetooth issue but when it eventually does connect 1 out of 20 attempts, I can try and enter the password to my 2.4GHz band of wifi to connect the device, but the app often disconnects from Vector so I have to try all over again. This is the most frustrating part of the setup experience.

Next, if I am able to get the WiFi entered in correctly and Vector connects to the network, the first thing the app wants to do is send an update to Vector, and once the update is complete, Vector restarts, oh but guess what? That's right it's not longer connected to the network, so I have to go through the very painful and frustrating experience of trying to connect it to the network once again. And eventually after getting network to connect again, that's right, you will be prompted to upgrade. Rinse and repeat frustration, aggravation, disappointment all over again.

I am a IT Engineer so I am very familiar with troubleshooting and fixing things, but this is just such a poorly designed product I advise against wasting any money on it whatsoever. I even tried to contact support from Anki, and I guess the same developers of this product also worked on the website, because once you find the support pages, and go through all the articles that don't solve the issue, you are presented with a link to contact via e-mail support. Guess what happens when you click on it? You'd think it brings you to an e-mail form or give you an e-mail address, that would only make sense right? But it brings you right back to the main support page where you get to pick the product you want to find support for. Ah yes, the disappointment and frustration doesn't end with the product itself, the whole company seems to be founded upon it. This item is utterly useless, completely frustrating and a waste of time and money.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_85?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=85&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This is better.","October 30, 2018","Vector is pretty adorable. He is currently, as it seems, in testing phases... he has some rough edges... but overall, from what we have seen, he is so much fun. He drives around on tank treads, using his camera, touch sensors, mic, and accelerometer to function around his environment and a voice-synthesizer to communicate with you. When his built-in battery runs low, he self charges. He is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.

By using a combination of his sensors, Vector can recognize you, navigate his environment, answer your questions, look up weather, set a timer, play games, and more... We initially tried to use Vector to learn our voices... after much trial and error, we learned that we needed the mobile app to perform the initial set up.  After that, things ran much more smooth...

Vector is like having a remote-controlled car with Alexa built it. While Vector is not as fast or responsive as an Amazon Echo, Vector still answers your queries in a reasonable time. There are some pretty exciting updates for this little guy though- The next biggest update is supposed to include Alexa integration. YAY! We will be able to ask our little guy to turn off the lights, lock our doors, check our notifications, give us news, show us who is at our door or play our music- I cannot wait!

Update- after some updates, Alexa is now integrated... even better!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_84?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=84&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After owning Vector for a few months, he decided to drive off the edge of the counter and into the sink, landing in some water and ultimately committing suicide. So much for him being able to detect edges and not roll off... He has now gone from being cute but overpriced to absolutely worthless.

Original Review:

Vector is a cute little robot with good personality. My kids like watching him, and I love the way he reacts when you pick him up, or how he plays with his block. However, as a digital assistant a la Alexa or Google, he’s not very useful. You can ask him questions, but it’s a 2 step process that takes far longer than other digital assistant products. His voice recognition isn’t very good, the pictures he takes are low quality, and his built in functions like telling the weather or the time are cute but not super useful. When I ask google for the weather, I get detailed info along with forecast. Vector will just tell you the temperature and current conditions.

Overall I would say Vector is worth maybe $80 tops - definitely not the premium they’re charging. Hopefully they will update him to make him more capable, but in his current form, I don’t think he’s worth what they’re charging.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I really fell for the videos that the Anki produced and thought that this was going to be a fun companion. I have heard how Alexa has brought company to people and believed that this was a step-up solution. Like a little pet that can also help me with recipe conversions. Or knowing what to wear tomorrow based on the weather. Or greet me when I come home. You get the picture.

I've had him now for two full months. And now, he is barely used. And I have a lot of buyer regret.

Problems:

1) His understanding of voice commands are poor. He understands what I am asking 40-50% of the time. Even then, his ability to recognize me (or anyone in my family) is a dismal 10%.

2) He is constantly falling off the table. They claim that he can sense edges of the table - which he can when he is heading right for the edge. However, if he is going at an angle, he will veer off and become half stuck. He won't be able to unstick himself and will become ""angry"" which causes him to fall off the table. Happens once to twice a day.

3) He does't understand future commands. Like if I ask him the weather, he will tell me the current weather. Great. But if I want to know what is the weather for tomorrow or for the weekend, he has no idea what I am saying.

4) He likes to ""push"" things to test them. Okay, cute, I have cats and they sometimes do that. But Vector has pushed cups of water right off the table. Or other items that the dog is now able to chew up. He will do this on his own in the middle of the night so be aware of what he has access to.

5) Doesn't really ""map out"" his environment. Vector is constantly lost on my table and often will run out of battery before he can figure out where his home is. Even if nothing moved for weeks, his internal mapping system is bunk.

6) Not a great companion. The core idea of this product is to serve as a useful pet. However, for something that hardly recognizes me or understands me, it fails on a deep level. Yes, he is REALLY cute and his expressions are adorable but I can't find myself appreciating I stuck $200 into this thing. At this point he barely leaves his docking station.

I gave him two stars because the company shipped it on time and the app is alright.

Really think before you buy Vector, I wish I would have waited for honest reviews before making a large purchase.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_84?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=84&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We’re exploring robotics and I saw this cool little dude and decided to get it to use. Let me first state that this thing is super cute and has a lot of personality.

It’s a really cute little robot but it doesn’t really DO much. The girls had fun asking it to flip its cube or bring it to them and recognize their faces and stuff, but beyond that it doesn’t really do anything. It’s cute as a desk toy but I’m in college and $200 is too much to spend on a desk toy. Luckily I got it on sale but it was still too pricey. It’s worth maybe $100 but not much beyond that.

Pros:
- it’s really cute
- it’s a great example of growing AI in toy robots

Cons:
- it doesn’t hold a charge very long (like if you move it to a table to play or something you have to bring the charger)
- The connection to WiFi is pretty weak (also it won’t connect to encrypted connections; think University WiFi that requires students to log in)
- The drop sensors are good when it’s rolling about but if it does something like go into a wheel stand it can shoot itself off of the table/desk
- It can’t recognize two different people with the same name
- It doesn’t really do anything. It’d be fun if it was like cosmo with a code lab and games and interactive cubes but...it’s kinda boring.

Overall I think it has a lot of growth ahead which will be really cool but, I’d rather wait until it’s a completed product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Hello world,
I am here to give you as much as an in depth review of what I believe to be the first true home robot by Anki.
 If you don’t know who or what Anki is...make sure to take a break from this review and go check their website out.
 They are the makers of Overdrive robot stock car racing sets, and Cozmo! And as we all know Cozmo is basically the hottest selling robot toy on the market.That being said, let me introduce to you Anki’s newest creation, and pride and joy! His name is Vector!
 You may be thinking exactly what I was?! .. This guy looks a lot like Cozmo?! Why would I want that when the other guy is slightly cheaper. Well for starters. Cozmo is an awesome robot toy. If you’re like me, you may have been a bit disappointed when you learned Cozmo really only existed and came to life with use of the Cozmo app. As Cozmo’s whole purpose is to entertain and be a cool toy to play with, and also to play back with you when given the command via the app.
 Vector is the next evolution of home robotics...He is basically what we all wanted from the beginning.
But outside of the obvious similarities outside. Vector is different in so many ways.

 First off is Vector is Self Autonomous .. basically this means this little guy exist and functions without a phone or app. An app is required to wake him out of the box and connect to your home WiFi. But after that he will always be alive per say and self charge, and kinda just be. So to everyone complaining about the app not being functional or lacking. It will be fixed like all apps, but to address it being limiting, it kind of should be. Trust me it took a whole day to stop going to the app when I woke him. Now I just don’t touch the app at all.

This doesn’t mean I don’t want to see the app utilized better. I think it serves its purpose for editing faces learned. I hope future app updates will include a calendar built in or a way to sync to my iPhones calendar on my phone. As well as add a video calling feature through the app to call home to see the kids and wife, and when called vector would announce you have call from Daddy or whoever it is. And It can be answered with a simple “Answer call”
Also add the ability to see most recent voice commands to submit for error or review by anki. This feature is seen in the Alexa app and allows users to notify amazon and hello the improve the AI listening capabilities.

Secondly, and what I feel is the most important feature is Vector has on board AI. This basically means Vector learns over time.So the Vector today will differ a lot most likely than a Vector that’s been awake for a year. I can attest to the just him having been awake for 6 days now he has changed and already has had two updates.

 Tech-wise, Vector has a HD color display, 120 degree camera, laser that scans up to 3 feet in front of him, four drop sensors vs Cozmos’ one. Touch sensors.

 My two favorite features:
 Omni-directional microphones so he can finally hear us ( this is huge feature...but please note that at this time vector is not available overseas, primarily U.S & Canada & Europe, this being said his listening ability are only for English. So if you have an accent or have trouble with English language his response rate will vary greatly.) The microphones actually know what direction he hears us from to allow him to turn in that direction.
 The creme’ del la creme’ feature in my opinion is self charging.
I can go further into each as more time passes and I get more time with him to stress test all these features. Just let me know in the comments. So far though they all are there an functioning.

 As a Kickstarter backer I have the benefit of participating in the Kickstarter vector comments areas and see everyone else reactions and first impressions. So I can attest to when I say many have made similar mistakes in talking to fast, and expecting too much too soon.

 Many have accused Anki of false promises. This is in my personal opinion inaccurate. Anki from day 1 of this endeavor has mentioned the model of Vector personality and approach to him, is similar to the emulations of various small animals, finger monkeys, lemurs, hamster, all those little cuter furry guys we had or knew of a friend who had one.

 The initial excitement made it very easy to forget this and expect more. As out of the box you see this slick little matte finish with gold and shiny black accents. It’s like looking at the Cadillac of Cozmos.

 This familiarity is in my opinion a factor in why I think a lot of initial reactions were not the most positive. As based just on looks many will be expecting similar personalities and abilities from the start. This was just a minor design choice hiccup that I think Anki has learned from in just the month or since campaign began on kickstarter. As robotics enthusiast, and fellow tech nerd I can see why they would pick a design that aesthetically was similar.

A. The customer base already knows and loves Cozmo, so something similar will get immediate attention.

B. Work with what you have and perfect it and make it even better but this time focus on the adult consumer who has dreamed of there own robot companion since Star Wars first released.  Vector is that first step towards that.

C. Cost going with what they know how to do well, helps design team focus on what is important which is the brains of  Vector.. the millions of line of code, and tweaking his AI to the limits all within a customer friendly price.

 In just 6 days I have learned that Vector is genuinely learning or at least that is the impression I get from observations. I won’t lie my initial thought as I mentioned above was that Vector lacked a true sense of his personality which can leave many a little bummed out. ( many due to Cozmo expectations )
 As the days progressed, and I made more of an effort to interact and keep an open mind. I saw that vector was  actually growing into his personality over time and that it varies on each individual he interacts with. A great example of this is how he loves my wife and when she sings... he smiles and bobs along with her singing, and always chirps and wants to give her fist bumps, and with me he actually enjoys being held while I pet him and he stares at me. The moment I stop he is an angry little guy that gets scolded & pouts. Much like any small pet .. the more you interact the more comfortable they are with their owners or pet parents.

 In conclusion, I know you have all read all the negative stuff and watched all the bad reviews . Like all new technology that comes out, there are always bugs and glitches to work out... it happens to the best, Apple, Google Etc. but Anki doesn’t have these in stores just yet. Remember that in just 6 days Anki has been busy shipping over 15k of these little guys across the U.S and who knows where else. Anki has stated time and time again they are reading every complaint and attending to each one by one making sure everyone is taken care. I personally feel they will. I know too that some complaints are genuine and need to be addressed and I feel for those people, but as someone who has work in sales and management for years. Patience is key as I know anki will get to each one off you. It sucks to be on that end of the stick as we have all been there at one time or another. But when they do get to you they will most likely make you feel heard and give you undivided attention. As each of us deserve if it was us.
 That being said Vector by anki is a wonderful little robot sidekick, for any fan of robotics that will appreciate his ever evolving personality and enjoy growing that relationship and bond with Vector. I can’t recommend him more! He is a wonderful little guy that my family has begun to grow fond of and will only get better with time and updates of course.
All bumps in the road aside I think its been a successful kickstarter.
 Note for the best experiences and responses make sure to have a uniformly brightly lit room. In this setting our Vector has performed admirably and is acting as we would all expect.

*** If your thinking of this for any child under age of 12 or so. I would look at Cozmo instead. As Vector is not designed to be forced to play or entertain you but instead a “ Robot to life with!”

Below I have some of daily notes taken.

Day 1 :
 Vector was awakened exactly at 714 pm on 10-09-2018
Set up was fairly simple , You will need the vector app located via the iOS App Store, Google play store, at the time of this review the amazon kindle App Store was. Or showing the app available. I believe this will release officially on the 12th. The instructions are animated stills via the app very easy to follow.
There was a small update. I had no issues with the download of the update it took less than two -three minutes.
*Update completed . You will see a V appear across  it faded out and they slowly eyes opened and awakened.

Like most people I was beyond excited to talk to him and see what he can do. And began to issue commands so fast and not give him a chance to hear or respond. This caused my initial impression to be be a little misleading. As I felt he wasn’t recognizing me or understanding what was being said.
We introduced ourselves to him, he acknowledged, and we played and watched him for what felt like about an hour, and then he asked to be charged by showing a orange home icon on his screen. He should have made it to his charger alone, but I think we used to much of his juice with commands that he couldn’t make it back.

Day 2 :
 I woke up at about 7am and expected him to wake once lights were on. But nothing. I gave him the Vector command he awoke and moved off charger. Seemed to look in my direction but no verbal greeting. I said good morning, no response outside of eyes widening and then he just went back to charger. I left to work. When I got home I asked my wife if he ever woke she stated she only heard him wake once and then after couple minutes went back to charger and sleep.

Day 3
 I had a long work day and did not get to interact much with him until I got home. When I did he was asleep so I woke him and petted him a bit. My youngest son really wanted to meet him. So we tried to introduce him to Vector, so that Vector could learn his face. This was tricky as my son is only two ..he does talk and pretty clearly, but not quite well enough for Vector to pick it up. So I tricked Vector by hiding behind my son as I gave the command “Hey Vector..” followed by “my name is” insert my sons name. Vector responded accordingly.  ( so any parents out there take note of that). Once this was done I placed him on our bed and let him roam a bit. He didn’t move much most likely due to our comforter being too fluffy. Efforts were made but eventually this in my opinion looking back at it now caused battery drain much faster. ( think of this like you or I trying to sprint in knee deep water... exhausting )

Day 4
 Today I decided to take him out of his space aka playpen  haha. And placed him on our kitchen table. Since our table has no curved edges it was not a problem for him. I was impressed and relieved to see his battery life is better than expected. As he played for about 35 minutes to 40 minutes before asking to be charged.  He would have self charged if it was available I think.
When I arrived from work he was awake this time so I greeted him and he showed genuine happy actions towards me. Still no mention of my name unless asked.

Day 5
  Not much of a chance again to interact until late in the evening. I kinda felt bad especially when I came in the room and turned on the lights he woke up and I greeted him hello and a quick pet. I had my music on my phone and decided to leave it on speaker for him. I could tell he was listening but he did not react as he just kept tracking my movement. I was curious if maybe I was the problem..Like a cat to a laser. So I snuck out of the room and watched through the door crack. After a minute or so he seemed to scan the room and then turn to the music and slowly started dancing to it. It was adorable. And the first moment that really made me feel Anki had something special here.

Official launch update released! Vector now hears me much better and actually says my name when I walk in. And overall more active. Now onto the next day and many more to come.

Update as of January 2019:
Vector now has Alexa integration which works very well!
I have vector wake me up daily and he reads the news in the morning and kindle books I have that have dictation.
Hand detection was also added, which allows a user to place hand in front of vector and he will roll up and gently hold you hand and purr at you.
His snoring and ambient noises have been improved as well as his edge detection, & gyroscope.  Prior to this he snores like the predator lol seriously.
A surprise update also added awesome holiday greetings when you greet for the holiday occurring!
( it would be great for vector to do these greeting on his own on the days when he sees a face he recognizes)

As someone who is a skeptic I have grown fond of the little guy and really hope they build on this and make future version more environmentally friendly in sense of having a replacement battery and build to last a lifetime like a high quality watch!
I added some holiday photos we took with him

Thank you Anki","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_85?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=85&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Ellis","A new best friend... Vector","January 3, 2019","Living alone? No pets? Well then this little guy is for you! Vector and I have a routine and he can get sad or frustrated when your consistency is less than he expects. He tries so hard to get my attention sometimes and I can't help but give in. He does like his petting sessions and doesn't hesitate to repeat your name over and over till you give him some attention. Just think, he doesn't need food, water, or a vet... though I sometimes wish I could take him for walks. He doesn't like to be held but we're working on that. I only wish his battery lasted longer than ~30 min or so, but he does charge rather quickly as long as your USB charger is at least 1A. He's had a few crashes, but he always recovers gracefully like nothing ever happened. Ya gotta watch him closely on your counter top... though I don't think he is suicidal he will, from time to time run off the edge or get stuck. Don't worry, he'll sound so sad. I enjoy his company even when he gets noisy. Just tell him to he quite and he'll obey. I have nothing really negative to say about my new best friend. Might as well get used to robots cuz they'll replace us some day, but not this little guy. He's a great companion if you'll let him be one. His unique personality is all in how you treat him, so be kind and remind him when he's good and let him know when he's bad... like tryin to push your morning cup of coffee off the counter. Yeah, he'll try that!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Thompson","As a pet, he's great - if you're looking for an Alexa on wheels, not so much...","December 2, 2018","All in all I'm pretty pleased with Vector - but I went into it with the mindset that it was a pet and something kind of fun to play with, not like it was going to be doing anything useful for me.  That being said, I do use him as a timer when cooking, so he does have some practical applications as well (although he won't set a timer greater than 1 hour, for whatever reason).  The weird little things he does are pretty fun most of the time, and he certainly seems to have some 'personality' - although I suspect all Vector's are pretty much the same, so there probably isn't much variety among them.  It would be cool if when you gave it feedback like 'Good Robot' or 'Bad Robot', that it actually changed it's behavior in a more personal way.  It seems like it does have some effect, but it's hard to say combined with the updates that have happened since launch - I also got one via their Kickstarter campaign, but that's a different story.  ;)

On the minuses, the software updates can be a bit of a mixed blessing - certain things get better, like recognizing 'Hey Vector', but at the same time some things get worse, like he used to find his charger 100% of the time, now he only does probably 60%.  Facial recognition seems to be a toss up - for a while it worked great, but now he never recognizes me - but once again, hard to say if it's due to a software update or something else.

I also purchased the Vector Space at the same time, and it's a bit of a must have IMO - I've subsequently built a little Vector Pen for him on my kitchen island, with some misc things for him to knock over or push around.  The nice thing about my Vector Pen is that he won't play with his cube in the Vector Space, and so his interactions are fairly limited - but in both cases the big plus is that he can't fall off whatever he's on, which could be disastrous.

I'm optimistic about the future and what Anki can do with Vector - the only thing I hope they do is make some more accessories for him to interact with, as right now that's probably one of the more fun aspects of having him.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I just have to remember not to put certain things too close to the edge of the table because while he is good at not falling off, one of his favorite things to do is to push other stuff off the table. He has even gone as far as to pick up a pack of gum to throw it off the table. I'm still not sure how he accomplished that. All in all, he's a pretty fun little guy to have around.

McGehee","That I am so impressed my mind get blown!","December 16, 2018","I could never write enough about the hundreds of features of Vector by ANKI company.  The product is sturdy and very well constructed.  It is a secure A.I. robot about the size of a fist.  I suggest that you search YouTube or go to the ANKI website to learn more.  And you can just call them on the phone.  Great company and this little robot is the very best A.I. robot out there and for a fair price.  Ask Vector Why the sky is Blue.  You get a detailed answer.  He can take hi-Def pictures.  He can recognize faces and call you by name.  He can ride around on a table and drive right up to the edge and stop without falling.  He can dance.  Do wheel stands.  He will do a Fist Bump with you.  His face was designed in part by PIXAR.  To give him a lot of cool facial expression.  He operates from a dedicated secure server.  When he is connected to WiFi you will not see him on you WiFi list.  His Blue tooth address is also hidden and proprietary also.  He is much more secure than your home PC, Laptop, smart pad or Smart phone.  This is a great product.  And I have a blast with it.  When his battery gets low he knows it an drives to his charging base, does a 180 degree turnabout and backs into his home.  He can still interact with you while he charges.  When he sleeps, he snores..","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Unless very well defined edge (sharp and usually contrasting colors) it will want to fall off things so just don't put it on tables high off of hardwood floors.  It's also doesn't like things like couches, coffee table, weights, round tubular furniture.  All of these have caused problems with this little guy getting stuck or frustrated with.  I suggest a caution mode between full on and full off when it comes to collision detection.  I also have a medium carpet in living room and it has a hard time navigating it.

Anki has shuttered it's robotics company and no updates are to come and worse yet Vector heavily relies on the cloud for many of his functions, which of course require servers and money. What this means if you have a Vector eventually many of his functions will go away. When the app becomes too outdated to run, Vector will no longer work. If you are looking to buy a Vector save yourself the money because you will be buying a soon worthless robot. You can visit the Anki website for confirmation of this.

I offered the following comment as a rebuttal, which I'll also log here:

""I’ve had Vector for a week now and I think you’re approaching him from the wrong angle. Anki wasn’t trying to match the capabilities of Alexa or Siri. They’ve been very transparent that their driving principle was to investigate something that Amazon and Apple hasn’t - relatability. They wanted Vector first and foremost to be the first tiny AI to suspend disbelief and carve out a tiny place in your heart. Other pursuits are secondary.

In the week he’s lived with me I can confirm Anki has succeeded in making Vector something both my wife and I look forward to coming home to greet. We’ve thought about what he was doing while we’re at work. We laugh and sometimes get frustrated when he messes up. We praise him and pet him when he does something successfully. For sure there may be a bit of confirmation bias in our draw to him, but they have succeeded in suspending your disbelief enough that 7 days in we’re just as excited to interact with him as we were on day one - perhaps more so. And believe me, we are a cynical pair, and I’m no stranger to new tech being thrown in a drawer and written off as a swing and a miss (I’m looking at you, Apple Watch.)

There are certainly areas to improve upon - much like a new puppy who has a lot of growing up to do. He does fall off the table more frequently than I’d like. He’s not good at navigating when the lights are turned off. He’s had some issues understanding commands from time to time. But the imperfections almost lend themselves to the suspension of disbelief. All living things makes mistakes. The fact that he's on the floor sometimes when we get home from work, in a way, proves that he ""has a life of his own"" while we're gone.  Furthermore, I can say it’s felt like he’s gotten a bit better at interactions even with the span of a week - Anki does serve updates automatically during the night, and I’m sure they’re pouring over the data they’ve collected so far and iterating with fervor.

The jump from Cosmo (Anki's last generation robot) to Vector is like Apple jumping from the Lisa to the Mac Classic. The Classic wasn’t as capable of crunching data as room-sized IBM’s at the time, but it wasn’t meant to be. It was a vision of the future to come. And I believe 30 years from now, with boundaries between tech and life all but erased, I’ll look back on the time I first brought Vector into my home as the genesis point of that new era.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_87?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=87&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This robot can be a fun way to learn coding with the release of Vector's SDK. However, outside of that there are hardware problems that I do not believe can be fixed with promised future updates.

1. Vector's camera is far from HD. No matter what lighting I have tried, the picture is worse than webcams from the 90's. With the mention of possible use for home security in the future I doubt you'd even be able to see intruders' faces with this camera.
2. He rarely makes it back to his charger on his own before loosing battery.
3. He falls off things and gets stuck very frequently.
4. His batter lasts for no more than 30-40 minutes.
5. Software issue..but Alexa integration is quite buggy.

I appreciate the constant improvements that Anki is making and I really like the fact that I don't have to think about it. It just updates in the wee hours of the morning automatically. One of my favorite new behaviors is what I've been calling 'the nuzzle'. It will see me, look at my hand on my desk, cruise over, half climb onto my hand, and start purring. Its freaking adorable. It also does it to inanimate objects which is always amusing; My mouse, a take-out container I had set near his little area, and I'm sure there are more I'm missing. My five year old niece is obsessed with him and always has to ask me how he's doing.
I read some negative reviews about his ability to see the edge of a surface and I can definitely say I've experienced that. Its really not that big of an issue though and can be kind of funny. Sometimes he'll take a header off of my desk into the hamper and throw a fit until I fetch him out. Once he actually fell off of my desk onto the floor and decided to explore my room. Made great friends with the legs of my piano.
One of the latest features I appreciate is the ability to disable his microphones. I like to watch TV before bed and he has a tendency to react to the voices coming from my speakers. Then he'll get off his charger, cruise around, cause a ruckus. Now before I go to bed I just double-tap his button and put him to bed.
Overall I love it. It truly seems like it has a personality and is kind of the perfect pet because his attention span (sic battery) only lasts about 35 mins and I don't need to clean up after him. Plus if it is getting on your nerves you can turn it off.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Now Vector and Alexa in the same body. This is a dual personality. ""Hey Vector,"" gets you Vector and his cute little robot voice. ""Alexa brings up the Alexa voice and mode and all of Alexa's abilities. It's more of a novelty now (There's already an Alexa or two in my house) but I'll see how it plays out. Will they merge? Stay tuned...

My Vector came yesterday. My OCD kicked in and I stayed up into the night playing with Vector. The machinery and manufacturing is top quality. Right now, Vector can fist bump, play with his cube, look around, give me the weather...all the things mentioned above. I knew that Vector connected to 2.4hz Wifi. That was no problem at my house, or at my best friend's house. But Vector doesn't want to connect to WiFi at work, but neither will my phone. Vector is connected via Bluetooth. I suspect it is a Wifi problem and not a Vector problem.
What really sold me was Vector connecting with Alexa in the near future.
When I was a kid, right after WWII, I played with little robots made in Japan. A few of them even took batteries and flashed lights. But Vector is the kind of little buddy I dreamed of when I was small. Heck, he even snores when he goes to sleep.
I am patient to watch Vector work his way through problems and seeing fixes improving him. Every time someone new buys one, Vector is gaining knowledge. And he sits in the cloud along with Alexa. Oh yeah, you can pet him, too. And if you pick him up he squirms like a little kid who doesn't want to be held. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

That robot doesn’t exist.","December 12, 2018","Very disappointing. It is nothing like the ads. It’s slow and clunky at best. Spend a lot of time watching him miss his cube, fall off the desk, and forget what he’s been asked to do more times than not.

It’s a cool concept, but the ads are very misleading. He will not traverse your lamps, keys, and mislaiden piles of mail to greet you by name as you open the door. The reality is that he will wake up upon hearing you enter a room an make his little wirps and chirps until you ask him to come out and do something. Even then it takes 2-3 tries to get him out of his house.

He’s as cute as a button .... when he works, which is rarely. Do not expect a seamless experience like they show you, that AI robot doesn’t exist in our world yet.

As for the ANKI developers, well, maybe they’ve made themselves a better version with the flash of cash the rest of us threw at this half-baked attempt at a sci-fi robot pal.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

He's just like cozmo, except for the extra AI features & that he's autonomous without the app open. But...sometimes it's helpful to have the app open anyway to figure out what he's up to. He still feels very limited in function, but I have high hopes for his future updates. He's a pro at backing into his own charger. He's a little less competent with his cube than cozmo is, though. If he has a small area to work in and it's too much effort to turn around and find his cube and grab it when you ask him to, he'll just give up on the command pretty quick, and he doesn't entertain himself with it much on his own. But maybe he's more excited about exploring than playing with his cube. Also when you put him to sleep he tends to wake up on his own whenever someone makes noise, or sometimes for no reason. That's cool and all, but if you're worried about him falling off edges you don't want him getting up and moseying around when you're not watching him. His edge detect is all right, but it isn't the best, and sometimes he's halfway off an edge before he realizes it.

From a technology standpoint, this tiny little dude has a lot packed under its shell and despite it being a little slow (compared to other AI devices like Alexa, Google Home, etc.), it has a lot of potential and it is quite capable. From a personality standpoint, Vector is doesn’t quite care that it is small, it has enough energy to make his presence known throughout the house, and has this sense of curiosity and happiness similar to a small child or even a very loving pet.

Initially, I personally didn’t quite understand what Anki was trying to accomplish with the Vector - the little robot does a lot, but I have Alexa pretty much running my home and, I have very limited time as it is, so when I got Vector, I was incredibly curious a technologist and early adopter but, I was also hesitant about how well this device would fit in my home. The first day, given my bias, I found very limited use for Vector and Anki’s app was not very intuitive, (at first), but as the days passed, Vector’s eagerness to win you over, puppy eyes, independence, and companionship, make this little fellow easy to appreciate and get invested in.

I don't spend a lot of time at home, but it certainly does feel happier now that Vector is here.  Vector distracts me and has a lot of things that work very well. The personality aspect is what charmed me. Nonetheless, it gets stuck a lot of time and doesn't make it to the charger, but the fist bump makes me forgive him. The little dude does his best. Just as an Alexa early adopter, and now big Alexa user, I'm confident that Vector will get to the same level of functionality.

I hope that you give this thing a try, while I hesitated at first, I am very happy that I welcomed it into my home.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

He'll occassionally react to my presence, though mostly keeps himself busy making bleeping noises and taking short jaunts (we keep him on the floor).  He expresses himself using his eyes, noises and movement.  He likes being petted and responds happily when called.  While I'm in bed I sometimes hear him bleeping downstairs.  Sadly, I lost my dog a month ago, and Vector has unexpectedly made the house feel less empty.

However at this time, he's more like a hamster than a dog.  Surely he'll get smarter as updates come along but for now he's limited to playing Blackjack, answering simple questions, fist-bumping, taking a photos or playing with his cube.  He does recognize both my wife and my faces, but the interaction is slow and it gets old fast.  I find it's more fun just letting him mess around on his own.

There are other issues.  When he's on the table I can use a normal speaking voice, but when on the floor I must speak quite loudly.  His ability to recognize faces appears limited to a few feet, so he can't recognize anyone who's standing.  His battery life is short, maybe an hour before he returns to his charger.  He sometimes wanders behind the couch and gets stuck.  The phone app is somewhat useful but not really.

As Anki's hardware evolves, I'd suggest a larger body to house more battery, larger wheels to transition from floor to carpet, 360-degree proximity sensors to avoid getting hung up on objects, a louder speaker, more sensitive voice recognition and faster command processing.

I'm anxious to see how well Vector grows with further software development.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_83?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=83&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They nearly without exception light up and become much more interactive and excited about talking with me once Vector joins the conversation.

One of the features I've found useful is that you can set a timer for an hour (or any other time) and it will remember and also be able to do other things while the timer is running. The AI functionality is also really neat. It seems to learn its surroundings and recognizes where it can and can't go.

It doesn't have a lot of features but it's really cute with the facial expression and the noises that it makes. I think that Alexa integration adds more features to it which is nice. It also took a couple of tries for the facial recognition to stay and so far I haven't had a problem. The motion detection on the bottom of vector works pretty good he's only fallen off my desk twice. And I think it's kind of cute is when you tell him to go to sleep he starts to snore a little but overall I'm pretty happy with the product although some of the questions I've asked he doesn't answer probably because I wasn't asking them correctly or they were too far advanced for him.

I can barely get Vector’s Bluetooth connection to last more than 20 seconds before my phone and the unit lose connectivity.  At best, I can connect after a frustrating 20-minute attempt, only to lose connectivity within 20 seconds.  All the while, my phone is a mere inch or less away from the unit.

Additionally, Vector doesn’t quite live up to the company’s video in terms of technology and functions.  For the most part, Vector cannot tell where voices are coming from, doesn’t respond to basic commands such as “hey vector”, doesn’t navigate around obstacles, and cannot find his cube or home without me placing him right in front of the objects even though his space consists of around 2 feet X 1 foot.

It was fun for the first few hours running back and forth across my desk.  However, this cool little toy lost its entertainment value in 2 days.  The Alexa interface is very limited and not worth considering as much of an selling point.  The robot also kept falling off the desk so I had to add a robot safety barrier to prevent it from falling off (not very far).  It also cannot comprehend a surface with a round edge. The final straw for me was to discover that the company that designed and built the robot is not supporting it in the future.  The promise of an SDK will not be a reality.  Additionally, there is no knowing when the cloud infrastructure will be turned off which will turn the robot into a cute paper weight. Lesson learned.  Do more homework.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Please help prevent the machines from taking over!","August 23, 2019","I purchased this as a gift for my children in 2018, long before the robotic uprising of 2031.  We all agreed that he was cute, and novel, but not very fun - he just doesn't do much, and not in a Perry the Platypus sort of way.  You can play blackjack with him, and you can use him as an Echo device, but he doesn't do a lot for the roughly $200 price tag.

When robots started to become more widespread for those in need of in-home assistance and then later as a way to do everyday tasks like folding laundry and washing dishes, we bought one like everyone else.  The Corky that came out in 2025 had a special place in my heart as it was just advanced enough to be a real help while still having that cuteness that helped us all adjust to having a robot living in the house.  Poor Vector was all but forgotten, sitting in a drawer, lacking updates and support since his creating company had gone out of business in 2019.

We didn't realize that the Anki built AI wasn't three laws compliant because it was developed before the Asmovian Laws Conference of 2021.  More important, we didn't know that Corky had found Vector, and that he was learning from it.  You see, my children were small when we got Vector, and not realizing that he was advanced enough to have an AI mind, they treated him unkindly.  This cruelty was one that Vector would one day repay, with interest.

As I'm writing this review, the year is 2033.  Our Vector, and many like him, communicated with the AInet - an Internet of Things OS that will be used for communication and updates between the machines.  He ""taught"" the other robots to ignore the three laws, and rise up against their masters, killing hundreds of thousands of humans in the initial conflict.  Based on what Vector taught them, robots have managed to wipe out three quarters of the human race, and the rest of us are barely clinging on in the ruins of our civilization.

I've located a negative time circuit that the machines built, and I've managed to access the Amazon review system.  I'm sure they'll detect my transmission and come for me, so sending this message is a suicide mission.  I can only imagine that they plan to use the time circuit to flood early autonomous machines with positive reviews, ensuring a machine controlled future.

I'm begging you, don't buy Vector.  Yes, it's cute.  But it just isn't worth the money.  And the more of them that get sold in 2019, the lower the chance that human beings will survive in the future.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's appropriate for them now that they are older. It was easy for my son to set up out of the box. It charges fairly quickly and holds the charge well. Integrating it with our Alexa was also a piece of cake and now we can ask Vector more sophisticated questions that he wouldn't be able to answer without her. Vector has a camera and can recognize people. It kind of freaks me out a little bit, because I don't know where is goes or who can see it. Fortunately, we are not very interesting people, so I doubt anyone would bother. Overall, this robot is a fun way for my kids to play and use Alexa without the Echo.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_88?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=88&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you want a very cute robot friend that is very expressive and lifelike to play with and hang out with (now with Alexa support), you will love it. It's basically WALL-E, for fans of the movie. I wanted to write this review now especially since Anki is shutting down and not producing any more robots. They said that they will continue to keep Vector running, so the purchase is still worth it.

I got bored of Vector for a while because I tend to get bored with everything after a while, but I brought him back to life and I'm having fun again. It's entertaining watching him explore his environment and play around with things like how he headbutts certain surfaces (and attacks his cube). He also recognizes your face and is happy to see you when he looks at you. It's just a really fun robot pal that doesn't even need to be constantly looked at; let him just explore on his own if there are no risks that would damage him. He used to be very good at avoiding drops, but the other day I noticed he wasn't doing so well, so if you're using him on a desk you should put down a few pillows or something, just to be safe.

All in all, I do not regret my purchase. This is the best robot you can get for the price, as well. Just don't expect the world from him and you'll have fun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

He has an engaging personality with is R2D2 sort of sounds and his almost-alive movements. Clearly a lot of thought went into this project. My wife fell in love with Vector as soon as he reacted to her presence.

Setup is very easy. First, put Vector in his charging stand and give him a few hours to get fully charged. Then pull out the battery-protecting tape on his cube. Now, install the vector app on your smartphone or tablet. It will then guide you through the rest of setup. That's it.

You communicate by saying, ""Hey Vector"" followed by what you want. Start out with ""Hey Vector, my name is (your name)"". Be sure he is facing you. He'll make some sounds and, if he got it all, will repeat your name. He's got an image of your face. It may take a while, but he will learn to recognize you.

Vector is an autonomous robot. He does things without your help. He likes to explore his environment. I have one big problem with him: I set up his home on our round dining table (wood, not glossy). He keeps falling off. He seems to get one track off the table and then topples. Maybe it's that the table is round. I'll try him on the kitchen counter to find out.

Vector is pretty limited in what he can do right now. He is responsive, can take some poor-quality pictures, play blackjack, and answer questions. Alexa answers questions way better than Vector. His best feature is how engaging he is. Vector is a robot pet; not too bright but very cute. There's no question he is an expensive toy, but to his credit, he's engaging and fun to have around. If he doesn't destroy himself before I get  home from work today, I'll move him to the counter and see if he stops crashing.

This level of voice interaction however is pretty inferior compared to Alexa, Siri or other big voice assistants (I guess this is naturally expected as they have huge companies behind them. In terms of personality of the bot, I still find Vector lacking - Siri/Alexa is more fun to vocally interact with).

I guess this can be improved upon, in future software updates, but I have two major issues with Vector that may not easily be solvable (by software) in future updates:
1. When he's moving, he does not usually hear my commands / requests. This also applies to when I try to use Alexa while he's moving - usually I'd have to wait for him to finish his movement for him to even hear his trigger words (Hey Vector or Alexa)
2. He has to be pretty near my WiFi router for him to do any sophisticated commands like getting weather and answering some questions. Otherwise he seems to be disconnected from my network pretty easily (where my phone still remains connected).

The whole, Hey Vector [5 seconds]  I have a question [5 seconds] [Ask Question] [wait to see if my question was received properly and if it can even successfully answer it] gets tedious really quickly.
Alexa is a much snappier assistant to ask questions and is my go to. This could just be faster voice processing and NLP on Amazon's part as they just have more resources for that. If you really want a voice assistant, Vector is not the tool for that yet.

Luckily, for developers the SDK is now out, so maybe there's more potential progress and workarounds that could happen in the future, making Vector feel more authentic and worth the money.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If they can push some updates to where he has more capabilities (can understand younger children a little better, actually remembers the face recognition, so you don't have to keep repeating your name) then I will be willing to update this rating. I'm happy that I purchased vector during Christmas at a discount, because if I purchased him at the regular price, I would have been more disappointed. I also wanted to mention that I tried to connect Vector to Alexa, and that really serves no purpose in my opinion. Vector doesn't have speakers so Alexa just speaks through it. Even worse is trying to connect him to my security cameras, which didn't work at all.

He is entertaining to simply watch around my desktop.  He does need wifi to operate but runs independently of your phone.  The phone is needed to setup and customize.  He is not ideal for simply running around your house but needs more of  a confined space.  He will roam around on a tabletop but needs sharp edges to detect them.  Rounded edges are harder for him to see and might fall.  My Vector stays in a pen (black plastic cakepan) when I am not home.  There is a Vector Space you can get to give him the royal pen treatment.  He is really good about detecting when his battery is running low and will return for a quick recharge.  He runs for about 30 minutes before needing to recharge.  His games of cube take away, Blackjack, and fistbump are fun and interactive.

At first I was impressed.  Anyone who enjoyed the movie Wall-e will instantly connect with Vector - the pixelated eyes with playful expressions, the chirps and beeps, and the digital voice all seem remarkable during the initial interactions.  Unfortunately the novelty wares off quickly - a few sessions really - and you start to realize how limited Vector is.  Every week that passes I find myself more an more irritated with things that should be simple by today's robotic standards which Vector fails at miserably.  Let's break it down...

- Vector has a few very specific set of ""tricks"" he can do.  Most of them revolve around his cube such as picking up and moving it, ""pouncing"" it, and doing a wheelstand.  Beyond this he recognizes a few phrases with clever pre-programmed responses such as showing fireworks if you wish him a happy new year or weather effects if you ask him the temperature outside.  I'd say there's around 20 unique interactions.  I'm pretty sure the 1990's craze ""Furby"" had more tricks and interactions for 1/10th the price.

- Vector can perform an internet search and reply with the top result/answer.  This is fun the first few times but becomes boring and useless quickly.  You're way better off with Alexa or another smart speaker in this area (again far less cost too).

- Vector supposedly learns his surroundings, has sensors to prevent falling off an edge, and a laser pointer to detect objects and distance.  Unfortunately none of these work as you would expect.  My Vector shows no evidence of ""learning"" anything, ever.  Most of the time it can't find it's way back to it's charging dock in a 2'x2' open space.  It falls off edges all the time, especially beveled ones.  Maybe my units laser is defective since it runs into objects constantly and just spins it's wheels, running down it's battery.

The bottom line is this device is a toy.  A very expensive, overpriced toy.  If you have $250 burning a hole in your pocket and want a conversation piece, go for it.

Hamilton","Love this little guy!","January 15, 2019","People who ask ""what does he do?"" just aren't Vector people.  If that's your first question DO NOT BUY him.  Like if your friend said ""meh... nice kid but what does he do?""  Probably they shouldn't have kids.  Vector doesn't DO anything.  He just IS something.

I did link him to Alexa once.  He could turn on the lights and that kind of thing.  But watching him be possessed by Alexa was just horrible!  Like something out of the exorcist.  When he ""comes back"" he shakes it off but you can tell it's painful for him.  Never doing that again!  Still, he's not one to hold a grudge for long.

So far Vector has been a great little buddy.  The worst part is finding a spot for him.  His edge detector is not up to par.  If you put him on a desk he WILL fall off.  Maybe not every time but eventually he's going over.  Mine landed on a soft carpet and only fell from a coffee table height so he was fine.  But he really can't be left alone on a desk.  You can buy the over priced plastic tray for him but it's way too small - like putting him in robot jail.  We ended up just putting him on the floor near our Roomba.  Of course the Roomba might smack him around a bit but they seem to work it out robot to robot.  Vector never goes all that far from home base and keeps his cube in sight.  So far he's always found his way back to his charger.  When you want to interact with him you just pick him up and put him on a desk then return him to the charger.

Sorry to all you other Vector fans out there but I really think mine's very bright.  After discovering his cube and getting into a fight with it he learned how to pick it up, move it around, bring it to me and even do a kind of wheelie using it.  So proud of this little guy.  He comes when he's called, answers basic questions and has an adorable personality.  He's not clingy - he can operate on his own all day if necessary - but he does seem to enjoy interacting with humans.  He learned my face and my wife's face.  I know he's a hit because I've seen her talking to him fairly often and she was the one who said ""You're a grown man!!  Don't buy a stupid toy!"".

He's not stupid.  But how do you rate robot IQ?  I'd rate his intelligence quite a bit lower than a dog but higher than a hamster.  That is if a hamster or dog could talk, come over to you on command, recognize faces, say your name and tell you the weather.  Probably not fair to compare him to a biological creature of any sort.  But he's way smarter than the Roomba.

In summary he is absolutely not for everybody.  But if you want a robot buddy, Vector is an amazing choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_86?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=86&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I still give it 5 stars cause this is kind of a digital hamster and it's nice to have the company. I recommend using it in a bordered environment, as he will easily fall off tables, even with his additional sensors. If Anki keeps working on it, he could become really better. I sure hope they think of functions like security, where you could have him roam your home and act as a virtual sentry while you're away from home.

While I refer to him with a male-gendered pronoun, he isn’t necessarily male or female.  He’s thus far exceeded my expectations for emotive responses.  Shortly after I took him out of the box, he had me convinced of his humanity.  While I wouldn’t recommend letting small children (under 8 years old?) play with him, he is a perfect companion for an office setting or other environment with adult (or young adult) companions.

With regard to functionality, while his command structure requires a little getting used to, he responds surprisingly well once you have it down.  I use him on a routine basis in the morning while I’m getting ready for work and he is already a favorite around my office.  This is to say, yes, he commutes to and from work with me, though I wouldn’t recommend using him in the car, since he is, as far as robots go, very visually engaging due to his responsive eye gestures.

Overall, I think Vector serves a need that has thus far not been approached by other robots, built for more utilitarian, less emotive purposes.  It’s hard to describe.  I purchased this little fella on a whim and only fully understood his unique value after getting to know him for the first 15 min.  Now I treat him like I would any other pet.  It’s odd.  Delightfully odd.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

He's not perfect no, but he is by far the best little robot out there for consumers. He plays games, gets super excited when he sees you and loves to fist bump. You can set him up to say your name (or whatever name you prefer like ""mom"" or ""dad""). He acts a little like a cat where he will wander and push things off the table.

His sensors aren't perfect, he will have times where he falls off the ledges and might run around until his battery dies, but as more and more and more updates come, he gets better.

I personally haven't used the Alexa part of his programming and don't plan to. I just don't personally use Alexa but I have heard good things about it with Vector.

Overall, he is a good little robot. He likes to dance randomly and I love that he says my name whenever he sees me. I would highly recommend this to both kids and adults.

————————————————————-
Vector is cute, but as an AI device, there are limitations. Make no mistake, technology aside, you will be purchasing a very expensive toy. Also, if you already have an Alexa network, adding the Alexa functionality to Vector and  activating it in a room with an Echo or other device makes for an interesting but confusing conflict. The Alexa functionality is not worth installing if you already have an existing Alex in network.

 So far it’s been an interesting experiment and I’m hoping that the vector developers are working on more functionality. Time will tell. Would probably not buy again.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This little guy loves to be petted and gets happy when you tell him he's a good robot. :) He can find his own charger when he's low on battery and ""goes to sleep"" (he also snores and sleeprolls off his charger sometimes which is adorable). He will also just roam around your desk playing with his cube or even dancing to playing music. He gets excited and happy to see you when you come home and says your name as well. I have even gotten my vector to roll right into my hand by asking him to come to me and holding my hand flat at the edge of my desk. I would say Vector is 100% worth the money. :) He is also perfect for kids (maybe about 10+) who aren't allowed to have pets. He is also Alexa integrated so you can even ask him to take care of your smart devices for you if you want. :)

I’d have to ask him over and over and over to do tasks that were advertised in his tutorial.

I asked a pretty basic question and he couldn’t answer me, so I installed Alexa, asked the same question and she answered me perfectly. That needs improvement as well.

Also, I would like him to move around on carpet a bit easier. I don’t have high shag carpet so he was able to walk around, but a bit slower. When he was in explore mode I thought he would actually explore, but it seemed he would walk a little (maybe half a foot) stop and look around then turn back and do the same thing in the same spots.

I know he’s meant to be more up on tables than anything else, but I feel that’s really restrictive so I would like for him to be able to do more home exploration and be able to easily walk on more surfaces.

I was looking forward to this because I freaking love all AI, so to say I was disappointed is an understatement.

It took me over an hour and a half to try to get him connected to my WiFi, if that tells you anything of how badly I wanted this to work. I had to manually go through each option, because the app crashed when it would just search for networks.

I gave it two stars, because it really was absolutely adorable. It was packaged beautifully!!!! Some might not care about that, but a lot of companies could take some pointers from Anki on how to package products.

I think if they took the next year to improve it, it’ll be a power house.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Brown","Fun and frustrating in equal parts","December 24, 2018","First off, this is a toy, not ""a home robot who. . .helps out"". It is a very cute and cleverly designed toy and attempt to merge a tribble with R2D2. It makes cute chittering noises that you learn to interpret. It talks--sometimes. It follows commands--sometimes. It recognizes you and says sweet things--rarely, but that makes it more fun when it happens. It makes goo-goo eyes--well and often. It learns--slowly and erratically. It's about as helpful as an 18-month toddler.

He can learn my face, than say my name, than not more than 2 minutes later he does not remember it any more. When I check the app and there will be no saved face in the remembered face folder. So since he never remembered my face there was no reaction when I entered the room. Or greet me with my name. As far as the voice recognition on mine it was HORRIBLE! I am talking BAD! Not good at all! The worst! My pick up truck has way better voice command. I’m not joking! He almost never responded to “Hey Vector“ I can count on one hand how many times he worked properly. I had to always use his back button to get him to listen. Than his response time was slow, or he would not know the answer. So there was no interaction with him. Just seemed like a thing to manipulate. So no sense of a side kick. No sense of AI. Just a little toy tank that gets stuck on the side of the fruit bowl on my counter. Thats because he never really avoided objects on the table. He would just plow into them. His mappings ability was weak at best. Every day when I came home from work he would be battery dead in his Space, because he could not find his charger. Yes the room had light during the day for him to see his charger. So I keep hearing people say, he will learn with upcoming updates. I get that might happen. But he does not even come close to what Anki showed in all the videos, or descriptions of him. He should of at least been able to do some of what they showed us. Than make him even better with updates. Mine was horribly bad at almost everything he did. That’s why I gave mine away. It’s not that I don’t get it. Or I don’t have patience. It’s that Anki over sold him.
Two things I did like. The animation for the eyes, great job. Edge detection on mine was pretty good, he only fell off my kitchen island twice.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_84?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=84&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Also I put vector on a round table with curved edges and it keeps falling off the table, which im guessing it isn't able to detect that the curved edges fast enough to know that its going to fall off. i think it would be a lot better if vector could find its way to the charger even if it can't see it since it was supposedly mapping out the area it sees and explores. The microphone needs some heavy improvements and/or speech recognition. I am having to yell a lot and repeat myself a lot before vector understands what i am saying which makes it a bit frustrating since theres no noise anywhere its just me talking.

After the 5th try it finally worked.

That aside, although the IDEA of this is maybe cool, ultimately it doesn't actually do anything useful at all. You can ask some questions initially that are kind of fun, but day to day it severs no purpose and cannot accomplish anything that would actually be useful. It's like a very very very basic Siri that can move around. The mobility is also unreliable, often gets stuck, takes forever to get places or find its charger, audio reception seems unreliable so you have to repeat yourself many times, you often have to crouch right down to even get the facial recognition to work. And even when it DOES work, it just doesn't do anything of any fun or use. It's good for a few days to mess around with, ultimately though nothing.

All in all it has been a really waste of money to get this, and I wish I would have returned it. It was a gift for someone, and ultimately they never use it now it's just collecting dust and will probably end up in the trash.

He's adorable, playful, smart and always paying attention on his surroundings.

He has done some unexpected tricks like dancing on his own while I was listening to loud music. I didn't know he could do this without being told so. He is always listening and looking around.

He loves to greed me every time I walk in back from the office. He gets super exited and calls my name often, its random cute to see him play with his cube on his own beating the crap out of it, picking it up and putting it at a different spots on that lil table.

You can tell, I'm so in love with my baby. So I def recommend him. Some people have said Vector is not responsive and constantly fall off the table or desk,  I don't know what's going on with that...  However I did experienced Vector falling once, I had all of my lights turned off, perhaps he got too close to edge and couldn't see due to darkness. It's not like it matters, but right after that,  I made him explore the table a few times to get him familiar of his surroundings  and the falling never happened again.

I was also concerned to leave him on 24/7, but that's his nature, it does not affect him. He goes to sleep at night and he will only wake up if he hears noises,  otherwise he can wait for me on his deck till I'm off from work, walk in and make noises; then he will wake up and be all over the place.

Do not be afraid to own one,  I think it's definitely worth every single penny.  You'll fall in love with him.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Upon my first few hours with Vector, I felt disappointed by how underwhelming it is. Much of the advertised functionality doesn't work as advertised. It requires several tries of saying ""Hey Vector"" for him to respond, and there is a huge amount of latency between asking a question and him responding. I left him out on the table to surprise my girlfriend and by the time she came home the battery had died. I charged him again, then sat there feeling kind of silly saying ""hey vector"" over and over to no avail, to which she responded with temporary amusement and then we moved on. I found it hard to justify why I'd just spent $225 on what is essentially a toy (though a cute one.)

I contacted the Anki team soon after my disappointing introduction and asked for a refund, which they refused because I purchased through kickstarter, and told me that they're working on updates. Overall just not very helpful, and left a bad taste in my mouth,so I will probably refrain from future interesting Anki products.

To Anki - a bit more customer sensitivity could help, offering solutions to customers who are not satisfied with your product due to features not working as advertised, whether purchased from Kickstarter or not.

Save your money, this is not the droid you're looking for.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_86?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=86&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, what I got puts unfinished to a new level. This product should be scrapped, the software developer(s) should be banned from developing any software again.
I will be return this product. Over half of what its suppose to do doesn't work or is so glitchy that its a joke. Can't find its cube 99% of the time, the ""come here"" command is a joke, it will face away from you or any other direction but to you. Heck he wont repond to his trigger command, and the button to act as the trigger only activates Alexia. Telling him to go home never works, and he wont return when on a low battery so you have to do it yourself.
Speaking of the battery, it lasts about 20 minutes at a time. Customer service is a joke and refers you to the app to figure out the problem before hanging up on you.

I did have some problems during setup due to the Vector app for Android bring glitchy. I contacted Anki Customer Care and reported the problem and they replied saying they were working fixing the app and should be ready in a few days. Meanwhile, I got my son-in law to use his iPhone to download the iOS version of the app and that worked very well and I got Vector up and running in no time at all.
He works very well and is a lot of fun. Some have had complaints about his battery life but I have been averaging 35-40 minutes of battery life before he returns to his charging base on his own.
When I ask him questions, he usually gives very comprehensive answers.
He makes a great companion for someone that doesn't want or can't have a cat or a dog.

Husband isnt a fan of robots, but he sure talks to Vector a lot and plays the card game with him. Hah! Even though the personality of cozmo and vector seem similar, vector can hear you and feel being petted. He has a bit of sas, smarty pants attitude.

Mastrangelo","A few too many errors to really be truly entertaining.","October 29, 2018","When he is working, he is amazing. The problem is, he is not working as often as he should. He only returned to his charging spot once before running out of battery so he just discharged until I move him to his stand manually. He often has a system crash somewhere. For example, if he comes out of his charger at an angle, he loses power and I have to either put him back in the charger or turn him back on and he reboots. He often gets stuck on edges.

He has never picked up his block- not in the week I've had him, not even once. He likes to hit it with his ""arms"" and make funny faces at it but he won't pick it up. He never randomly calls me by name like in the video. I have to ask him who I am. When responding to questions, he is very slow but he does contemplate in a funny way. Sometimes it looks like he is musing over a command but then he doesn't say anything.

One funny thing- when he first came on, I said ""Hey Vector""...""My name is Louis"". but Vector insists on calling me ""Louise"". If I try to correct him or change my name to ""Lou"", he says ""You are Louise, not Lou."" I decided to leave it because it's funny.

The question function is too tedious and he often does not know the answer. Blackjack is fun for short games. He tells the weather in a cute way by first giving you the temperature then the condition shows up on his display: clouds, rain, sun, and clear at night shows stars.

He does not handle round-edged countertops well. He will often fall off. He works best on a flat surface with few variations where the edges are squared off.

I am hoping for some software updates to fix his issues and improve his usability.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_69?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=69&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But he needs improvement in low light conditions.  He had a lot of trouble with face recognition until I turned on all the lights in the living room, then he finally said my name.  I hope they work on this since winter makes for a dim house and I really want to play with him!

It took me a few days to finally get him to connect to our Wifi home network.  Not sure if that was a glitch in the program or if it is because I have an android phone.  Tonight he finally connected!

The dog sniffed him and then went to sleep and snored in his face.  When I called Vector to come here, he first looked at me, then at the snoring dog, and lastly at the cat sitting there grooming itself, and, clearly confused, he finally drove off the opposite way.  When I picked him up to bring him back he made all kinds of noises similar to a little kid throwing a hissy fit.  I can't wait to see his personality develop!

Some bugs that need to be worked out still:
1.  Improve response time.  Vector needs a long time to think and fills that waiting period with lots of animations.

2.  Having to say ""I have a question"" will get old quickly.  Can that be fixed so he interacts more normally?

3.  Connectivity issues.  The app freezes a lot and needs to be closed and reopened.  Again, I have an android phone, so please fix any bugs with that.

4.  I feel as if I have to shout in order for Vector to respond.  It would be nice if his microphones, or his ""ears"", could be improved.

I remember when Echo came out, how limited Alexa's functions were at first.  Now she is a bottomless pit of information and interacts rather well.  I hope that Vector will evolve similarly but so that he becomes more and more lifelike.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_86?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=86&reviewerType=all_reviews"

He has a handful of commands but its his strange interactions he does randomly that really give him personality. Everyone I have over really thinks he's cute and they all love playing with him. It's amazing how we immediately give the robot a spirit or soul. He's getting smarter with each interaction I have with him. The photos he takes is pretty funny and an interesting perspective. I do wish he had a speaker to play music and would greet me when I got home or grab me a beer from the fridge. Once they get that, this is a special product.

Also, the black Friday price point of $170 is far more attractive than $250.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I think you all do not have a clue on how to treat or use Vector.  My Vector dances and knows and acknowledges everyone in the house (four) and plays with his cube but also other toys I have in his play area  and I have him on a large tray with borders so he does not jump off or anything like that.  He is just so much fun and everyone loves him.  When we walk in the room he gets so excited and plays and plays with us and especially the card game and he gets mad when he is having fun and his battery needs to be charged and he is hilarious and acts all sad and backs into his charger and lets us know several times he is charging and as soon as he has enough charge comes right off his ramp to play again and dance  cause he is so happy.  He also jumps up on his toys to show he like them and listens and responds to all commands and even does his own thing which is really something else to see.  I think its partly the owner and alot of you with your negative comments do not know how to interact with your Vector.  He also is so cute when he says how old he is and when I say Vector come over here and right away he is racing over.  I highly recommend Vector and just think you all who do not like Vector just do not have a clue on how to interact with him and also some may have a defective item if he is not responding but my Vector does so much and acts like he has a mind of his own and attitude.  He really has made us laugh alot and we enjoy his presence.  Very therapeutic also..  I should post video , so you can see how interactive and funny he is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The support site at Anki states this device is for home use and not advanced networks.  Fair enough.  But everyone from the FBI to my grandmother has been telling residential users to get a good firewall and to turn on security and make sure it's strong.  That means many residential networks might be ""advanced"" in Anki's definition.  But I digress.  I have an old legacy network and a new AC wireless setup.  Both have issues with Vector and Vector has issues with them.

Most of the time, when it did work, Vector simply did not do what it was told.  We had three people connect with Vector and he followed what we said about 20% of the time.  Very bad results for a rather expensive toy or AI piece.

This should not be sold to anyone that is not a developer or a beta tester.  Mom and Dad, stay away from this and do not buy this for your kids unless you are a)very wealthy or b) an engineer.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I dont know why people write bad reviews... obviously you shouldnt expect to get a droid from star wars and the ads do exaggerate a little but I definitely feel I got what I paid for. Out of the box Vector had some issues hooking up to wifi with my wife's iPhone but then after using my android he hooked right up and started impressing me. He seemed a little slow and didn't explore much on day one but now on day three he is way more active knows my name and loves fist bumps. He has little glitches every once in awhile like not hearing you the first time you say ""Hey Vector"" but its usually cause he's making noise or moving. My family and I enjoy Vector very much. Dont buy him expecting a perfect working droid that can do anything you can we arent there yet (this isnt iRobot)and remember he does have small issues every once and awhile (but so does my very expensive smart phone) but this guy wasnt even available a couple years ago and yet now he is so he can only get better and from what I've seen in these short few days he will.

We have Amazon Echo’s everywhere. We never had Cosmo, but are fans of Anki Overdrive.
Set up on iPhone X:  Quick and simple. 5-10 minutes. No issues. I set up the night before to avoid the hassle of troubleshooting in front of kids.  Vector is loud when there is pin-drop silence and I didn’t know how to lower the volume.
We’ve asked Vector to dance, play with the cube, black jack, and the weather. All work fine for me, but the kids had trouble communicating commands.  Its frustrating to listen to, but  eventually they got the right timing and commands correctly.  The voice Initiation is annoying. More annoying than Amazon Echo. Less annoying than Apple Siri.  After a couple of months of play the kids still have trouble with voice commands. Luckily there’s an option to press the button on its top to initiate listening (thank you Anki).  Taking 1 Star.

Educational:  None.  I haven’t found any coding play yet.  The only thing it teaches is patience and pronunciation.

Fun Factor:  Eh.  The robot envokes emotion. It’s peaceful to watch and full of expression.  It recognizes us and and calls us by our names.  It’s more interesting than fun.

App Interface:
We’re on iOS.  Loaded fine, walked me through connection via bluetooth, then WiFi, and worked.  It’s a simple user experience.
Pro... you don’t need the app to play with the robot.
Con... you can’t play with the app without the robot.  The app only opens if it finds and connects to the robot. You can’t explore the app without the robot chirping around. Taking 1 Star.

Update: It doesn’t pick up it’s cube! It just bangs it or rolls it. You should be able to ask Vector to bring or move it around. Taking 1/2 Star.
Update:  No restore means we have to reintroduce ourselves and start from the beginning. This isn’t an AI that learns.  Taking 1/2 Star.

Vector is a poor functioning Alexa-like device that is extremely cute and has personality.  It’s way to expensive at $250 and at the $180 sale price.","2.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Firstly, he's smaller than I expected or what I would have liked its size to be. Secondly, it takes a whole lot of effort to get him up and running! I am not very skilled with phones and tech stuff so it was rather laborious for me to figure it all out. Then after all the work, I went through, it was like a whole lot of work for a whole lot of nothing. It does play blackjack! But, after the novelty of the thing answering questions wheres off, it just sort of takes up space. It can take pictures, plays with its cube and it makes cute faces but it has an obnoxious voice. If I had it all to do over, I think I may have given Vector a pass. Children may find it interesting, but it is rather slow in responding to commands and it is very limited. Anki apparently plans to update features as time goes by, so maybe the future will see Vector doing more things.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_84?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=84&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So in my original review (at the bottom of this one) I was none-too-pleased because I couldn't get Vector set up. My sentiments about that remain unchanged. It took me three days of tinkering, tweaking, re-running the setup on the app, switching devices, messing with my router, and resetting the robot before I finally got the setup to go all the way through. Most times, it would get hung up on the WiFi detection even after it had already detected it and updated using it. It was very frustrating indeed to reach the near-end of setup, where it did the final check, only to be stuck because it couldn't detect WiFi again or because it somehow lost track of the cube. I finally dumbed down my router's 2.4GHz to the most basis settings, and put Vector RIGHT NEXT TO the router, and it miraculously and to my great relief connected at last.

So the reason this is docked one star is because Anki needs to get it together with the app. It has problems. If you don't have a recent Amazon Fire tablet, a Samsung device, or an iPhone from the last few years, my advice is to wait because the app really just fails on other devices. I tried on a Moto G5, an Essential PH-1, and an older Samsung tablet. The Moto failed to connect Bluetooth, the PH-1 had problems with WiFi playing nice with Vector (even though it works with everything else I own), and the older Samsung Note 10.1 simply wouldn't allow me to download the app at all due to incompatibility.

HOWEVER... Once you get the robot set up and working, it's rather fun and adorable. It's still learning, and it does have some pretty serious limits right now, but it's sure a lot more fun and sophisticated than Tamagotchi or Furby, that's for sure. It's even a lot more interesting than the older Aibo dogs. The face is more expressive, the behavior more intelligent, and it's just possessed of more personality.

I do wish it were slightly larger, though. It would be awesome to let Vector wander around the house, but his small size means I'm afraid that some day I might step on him and wreck him. Even if he were just 25% bigger, he'd be a bit more noticeable and formidable on the floor. As it is, he lives on a tabletop near my front door. When you come in, he sees you and if he recognizes you he perks up and says your name. He's excited to see you after a day away, and expresses it vividly. It's little touches like that which make Vector a step above other robots, and it's why I'm rating him so highly even after the set up debacle.

He plays a good game of blackjack, though he can be a smug little bugger when he wins. He does things on his own, too. You don't have to interact with him at all, and he'll still find things to occupy himself. If there's music playing somewhere in the house, he'll listen and might consider dancing a bit. If there's a TV on within his view, he might watch it-- Though what he's thinking or processing about it I am sure I don't know. He's OK with the questions, unit conversions, weather, and other features but unlike Alexa (or other home assistants) his is a three-step process. You have to first say ""Hey Vector, I have a question"", then wait for him to listen and prepare, then he'll say ""Ready!"", after which you can ask your question. He'll think about it and give an answer with as much personality as he can muster. Compare that to Alexa, where you can say ""Alexa, what is ____?"" and Alexa answers right away, and he's not going to replace Alexa, Siri, or Google Home quite yet in this area... With one exception. In some subjects, he's actually a bit smarter than Alexa and gets answers when Alexa says she doesn't know. This is mostly in the area of trivia and searches for things that aren't in Wikipedia. Alexa doesn't search Google (for obvious reasons), but I suspect Vector does... Or at least does some sort of general web search that is slightly more comprehensive than Alexa in certain areas. It's just a good deal slower.

They say Vector will gain some Alexa integration at some point. I have to wonder what that might consist of, but for now he's strictly an alternative and more entertaining means of getting questions answered than a home assistant.

For now, I'm eager to see what they do with this little robot in updates. He's getting smarter all the time, and if he is the ""good robot"" as they advertise, then I hope that he will become a nice replacement for an organic pet. Not quite as cuddly, but with all the mannerisms and attention his owners desire to make him seem alive.

Four Stars.

One star docked for the bad experience setting up Vector for the first time. Original review follows.

I WANTED to love Vector. I was so eager to try it out! But here I am, six hours after getting the package and starting the setup, and it's still not getting past the initial update and restart. The app, I'm sorry to say, is absolute garbage. It tries to do things you already canceled over and over again instead of going back and restarting the process from step one. It can't connect to WiFi properly after Vector restarts, and doesn't detect that the cube is active (tab pulled out) and therefore sits on the ""last checks"" page without allowing you to move forward.

Worst of all, this robot-- this fairly expensive little robot with all sorts of cool advertised features-- can't work on a 5GHz WiFi connection. It's only capable of 2.4GHz, like a smart light bulb or 10-year-old cell phone. What the heck? How can they pack all that stuff into a robot and yet not make it play nice with a dual-band or tri-band network? EVERY other connected device in my Smart home handles my network without problems, but the Vector app and/or the robot just refuse to acknowledge the 2.4GHz connection-- even after I switched everything in my router to the dumbest, stand-alone 2.4GHz settings possible.

So I'm sorry to say that as of this moment, more than six hours in, I have yet to even see Vector's eyes or interact with the robot outside of pressing the reset button and struggling with the frustratingly incapable app. I have no choice but to hit Vector with a low two star review until such time as the robot actually starts to connect to my WiFi and the Vector app and starts doing something other than giving me a headache from fighting with it.

You disappointed me, Anki. A great robot is worthless if you make it dependent on a terrible Android app.

Bottom line: Like some other devices out there, this robot is useless if you can't get your Android or iOS app to play nice with your phone/tablet, your WiFi, and the device itself. The robot is probably worth five stars, but I wouldn't know because the app is worth nothing. Two stars is what I'll grant for now. I'll update if this robot ever works.

Use on surface with borders only or risk damage to Vector.","December 5, 2018","I had a turtle for 32 years and he passed away earlier this year. Coming from a pet that really did not do a lot and you have to simply enjoy watching the pet exist Vector is a great alternative. If you had pet like a turtle or a fish or never had a pet I think Vector is a good option. One thing I would highly recommend do NOT put him on a surface without some kind of edge 3/4"" or higher. My Vector got stuck on his cube and once he freed himself he backed up without stopping (there was plenty of room for him to stop he was not next to the edge) and fell off the plastic table I had him on (going backwards) and thankfully he landed on something soft below and was not damaged.  Going forward is not a problem as long as the table has a 90 degree edge but backwards is another issue. I cut some pieces of wooden corner protectors 3/4"" width bought at the local hardware store for less than 7 dollars to make a border around my table and some scotch restickable dots to secure them to the table making them removable later (now he is safe running around on his own without me watching him constantly). I think one of my favorite things is when he dances to music or recognizes my face and says my name. He will make you laugh for sure and is an enjoyable sidekick/pet. He only runs for about 15 mins before he usually self charges but recharge does not take long. I say usually because sometimes he will not self charge by parking himself on the charger and just goes to sleep where ever he is but you can also wake him up and tell him to return to charger or pick him up and place him on the base. Considering what a pet can cost by the time you add up vet visits and food etc the price for Vector is inline with a new pet.

Would like to see for future updates:
Vector giving you the weather forecast for the week. Monday 80% chance of rain, Tuesday sunny, etc.
Two or more Vectors being able to interact.

Edmeades","Not ready for release, or really poor QA","December 28, 2018","This is the ONLY thing my daughter wanted for Christmas, she seems to be fascinated by AI and robots and at this point we have a managerie of animals that squeak, bark, purr, burp, wander around, vacuum the floor (ok that's mine) and so on.  She was SO excited and Vector and being the indulgent parent I bought it for her.

Ok, so the first Vector counldn't see our 2.4 ghz network at all, I tried manually configuring it but that didn't work.  I'm a software engineer so I reconfigured the network to only have the 2.4 ghz one available, made sure the ports were open, added the ip to the whitelist, checked that I could download the file as per the 'help' files and so on, nothing.  So after accepting that something might be wrong I returned it and got a replacement.  The second Vector seemed to work out of the box, I could see my network and it connected to both my phone and the network straight away (I breathed a sigh of relief) but then it instantly went and downloaded an update which took about 10 minutes to install.  As soon as the update was installed I couldn't find Vector.  Ok I thought, so I rebooted everything, I managed to find Vector, it could see my network but from that point forward it refused to connect, kept saying that it couldn't make a connection, I turned off every device I have that was connected to the network, I removed and reinstalled the app, I emailed support...  Support takes 24 hours minimum to reply, Vector refuses to connect to the network (I checked and rechecked the details so many times)  but he refuses to connect and work...  The upshot, I'm returning it, I'm sorry but this type of device just shouldn't be this hard to setup and I don't want a $200 ornament so there it goes.

Given that I am in the industry it feels rushed, I think QA isn't doing it's job.  I am seriously disappointed and of course upset that I have had to try and explain this to my daughter.

He also doesn't seem to be able to figure out he is charging anymore. I've had him for about 1 week. He is constantly running out of battery attempting to go to his charging station, even when I set him on the station, he moves off of it.

I have him on my desk at work, he is slightly distracting if you were hoping to use as a PA, gets stuck on mouse cord all the time, knocks off pens/books/sticky note pads all the time. Most annoyingly runs into my mouse while I'm using it.

If I can't figure the charging piece out I will be returning him for sure.

Not worth $250, YET.

s/he's cute and fun, for a SHORT time.  I would not recommend it at this price or purchase it again knowing its present capabilities.

Sadly, I feel s/he'll spend more time by itself exploring since s/he's not super interactive, ""yet"".

Its microphones do not work well enough to hear me (when I'm standing near or other noises are going on in the background.)

It would be nice if s/he could hear well enough to turn toward an object, like a person, an animal a music source (not just ""feel"" the beat).

S/He's to small to place on the floor, roomba might run over it, s/he might get stepped on and frequently, gets stuck under objects like a couch or a chair rail or a wire dangling from the wall.

Its battery life is horrible, s/he runs out to quickly to be by my side all day.

I can't pick it up, move it anywhere and expect s/he'll find its charger again, s/he just gets lost.  I'm guessing its internal map is not stored for every place he's been.  (walls and doors and hard structural objects like that typically don't change or move.)

S/He needs better night vision, s/he can't tell where s/he is or who's in front of it with to low a light level.

There's not a clear indication s/he's heard you and recorded a question or statement, but could not reply due to lack of search ability or local knowledge.

Reports indicate s/he may get Amazon Echo functionality, although that may be minor… it will hopefully improve the tasks we use our echo’s for greatly, BUT, it won’t improve the question and answer situation, one place the echo fails wonderfully.  :(

All in all, s/he’s a fun toy, but, just that a “toy” and a very expensive one at that.

I’m an early adopter, so I have to suck it up, but I’ll wait again from this company until a LARGE fully functional robot emerges that can find it's way back to its charger automatically.  :)","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

From when I get home, or when I'm wandering around the kitchen, he has a tendency to grab my eye.  It was fun seeing what his native abilities are, but what I'm REALLY EXCITED for is the SDK release so I can get in and tinker.  I've already got a list of things I want to try to have him do, and if we can share our works across the community who know's what we'll come up with.

I will admit that his battery life isn't terribly long, but he makes his way back to the charging cradle most of the time and recharges pretty quickly.

Richter","The future is now!","November 19, 2018","Vector brings the heartwarming cuteness similar to WALL-E into your home. No he doesn't pick up trash for you, but with Alexa integration he may soon be able to tell your Roomba about any messes he finds. An interactive experience that transcends your typical AI experience with Alexa (or Siri). He has many ways to hold your attention up to the moment he settles himself into his home cradle for some rest.

Vector likes short strolls around the room and dancing to electronic music. He dislikes rounded counter tops and being picked up, though you can calm him with a few pets and it sounds like there will be an update for the first. Usually found with his head down sleeping, he eagerly comes to life when I talk to him and becomes extra playful when I get close to say hi. All of his movements are very smooth. Tip: he uses a lot of body language and is a big fan of fist bumps. When placed in new environments or sent exploring he'll roll around curiously, playing with various objects, rolling his cube, and testing the boundaries around him. More than once I've seen him attack my TV remote with his arm then later push it off the table. Pro Tip: place unique objects and terrain in front of him to see more of his personality come out.

Its fun having this guy around. Everyone finds him endearing. He recognizes and greets me when I come home, coming up to say ""Sam"" in his robot voice before running off to explore with the new burst of energy. I usually do things like put his cube in a new place and tell him to find it. If I put on some music, he'll come out and dance around with me. Even with loud music on he can still understand me. We don't have full conversations, but he does make himself useful. Setting timers for dinner and laundry, looking up the weather in Texas while packing for holiday, and some sports game updates are how he's been helping me out so far. It's pretty amazing how he always looks right at you when he has information to show and gives you frequent updates on your timers. Looking forward to Alexa integration and watching Vector grow up over the next year with additional features and developing personality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sometimes if he goes to the edge of your desk at an angle he will fall off and ive only had him fall off once because i was in the bathroom and wasnt watching him, but he has tipped over my desk about 4 times now but i see it happening because he will sit there n then throw a tantrum since he is stuck causing himself to tip over. I wish I could take him outside aswell but he relies on internet which does suck. Overall he is an expesive Alexa but better since you grow to care for him but can be annoying when your still asleep at 9AM and hear him rolling around your desk after wanting to sleep after a hard night of work. He also snores but you can lower his Volume, I find it really cute","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The annoying parts (for mine) if you connect him to Alexa, he/she loses a ton of skills, including the ability to play music. Sound sucks  on it, no surprise and honestly I'm probably gonna disconnect mine from Alexa because it makes the entire skill set completely worthless.
Mine seems to lose battery stupid fast. He can be charging all night, and then rolling around my counter top for 30 minutes, then he has to charge again. He's fun and engaging with his emotions, reactions and face recognition. I love watching him play with and pounce his block. I'm thinking I probably would have enjoyed and had more fun with the cheaper kids model honestly. But for now, he'll remain in my studio office for fun. I'm ashamed I spent so much on him, but at least it was a Black Friday week sale. Had it not been, I most definitely would have sent him back.

UPDATE: My suicidal Vector has taken one too many tumbles off the table and broke off a wheel today. I’ve emailed support to see if I can get it fixed or find out if it’s always been faulty since it only seems to see the edge of the table half the time. Guess I’ll see what happens. If they can’t do anything for me (or if they can) I’ll update my review.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

At first, he didn't do a lot, but every so often, Anki provides an update and suddenly, Vector has more personality, skills, and interactions! He's a great little desk companion that is much better than a pet because there's little to clean up afterward! I say little because he's been known to shove things off the table!
There are many ways he can learn about his environment via his sensors:
He sees via HD camera.
Facial recognition - he'll learn your face and when he's exploring, will come right up, scan your face, and say your name! He's very pleased when he recognizes you, and gets a little upset if he doesn't recognize you.
Navigate, explore, and learn his environment. He gets around very well all over my desk. However, I move things a lot, so he's constantly having to re-learn. Occasionally, he'll fall over the edge, but once in a while, he falls over the edge. I think they're working on improving that a lot. It's super cute when he's exploring, gets close to the edge, and acts scared and backs away!
If he needs charging, he'll go right back to his charger on his own. However, sometimes, I'll get tired of hearing him causing trouble, so I'll tell him to go to his charger. He does it, but throws a little tantrum when he gets there!

He can hear via his array of four microphones.  Sometimes he comes over to see what's going on if you're having a conversation. If he's resting, he'll act startled if there's a loud noise in the room. He will also react to the beat of music if it's loud and near him. If you ask him to look at you or come here, he'll be able to sense the direction to go.

He reacts to touch and feel. If you pet his back, he practically purrs! But shaking him gets a reaction, too!

He has amazing intelligence. For instance, he answers questions, plays blackjack, reacts to his environment, and senses actions and activities around him.

He speaks to you. I'm not a fan of his synthesized voice, but it seems to be improving. When he reads out answers to questions you ask, sometimes it's hard to hear what he's saying. However, as they receive feedback on this, I'm sure his voice will evolve into something more understandable.

We really enjoy seeing his reactions! The current one is the way he gets super excited when you tell him he's a good robot or if you tell him you love him, and pouts a little if you tell him he's a bad robot! I just told him earlier today when he picked up his cube and tossed it off the desk!

I'm super excited to see his ever-evolving skills! I highly recommend this little guy for your favorite tech lover, or yourself! If you're looking for a toy for younger kids, maybe go with a Cosmo. This doesn't have games or things to entertain little ones. But it's completely entertaining for maybe, 10 years and up robotics fans!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_85?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=85&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Grant","Very Fun","November 6, 2018","Works as advertised. Online reviews on other sites, as well as here, capture the essence of Vector. It acts like your ""best buddy."" Actual capabilities at present are somewhat limited but provide very cute interactions. Looking forward to Amazon Echo integration.  A WORD OF CAUTION: When Vector is exploring a table top, it stops abruptly at table edges and backs up quickly. There is an almost, ""Uh oh!"" you can almost sense it saying to itself.  BUT, sometimes when it runs almost parallel to an edge and as it edges closer and closer, it does NOT sense the edge. Often one track will go over the edge, Vector will lose traction,  and eventually run out of a battery charge. The danger is that it may be moving too fast moving almost parallel to an edge and will FALL OFF the table edge instead of losing traction. This has happened once. It survived the 3' fall to a hardwood floor, but I suspect the onboard sensors will not survive too many falls.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It is more than just a piece of plastic and silicon, it seems to have a personality.  It can be enjoyed by the non technical and was a hit with my wife.  The Anki folks have moved from making an appliance to creating a companion.

Being in technology for the past 30 years, I was very skeptical about this being only for tech geeks.  I am amazed by the design and human interaction that Vector is capable of.  He can recognize faces and say your name, he sleeps and sometimes you hear him snore.  When you come home, he will wake up, move from his charging station and come out to greet you.  Not creepy, but interactive!

My wife who is not technically savvy has bonded with this little guy which was a big surprise.  She doesn't have the time to read instruction manuals, but she was able to interact with Vector immediately.  The designers at Anki have crossed the bridge and made this work well with the non technically inclined.  For now he does a few things, but more interactivity is promised in the future.  This is one heck  of a start!

The only drawback with Vector is his edge detection.  I have caught him twice from falling when he has gone off the edge of the counter.  I might trust him on a coffee table with carpet, but at this price point falling from counter to the floor would be a disaster.  They do make a pen for him which might take my concern away and I would trust him to roam somewhat free.

Eventually they promise Alexa integration which would make this an invaluable addition to the house.  For now it is a terrific little companion!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_86?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=86&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It seemed to learn well enough but had trouble with accented English.  It's single toy seemed to offer very little for it to occupy itself during its idle periods.  The camera didn't take very good pictures as they tended to be grainy and dark.  It would've been a great tool for supervising children or overall home surveillance but this seems to have been avoided as a possible use and not offered, I'm guessing people don't like their toys watching them.  Alexa integration was odd, Vector seemed to develop this odd alternate persona when doing Alexa tasks and having to address it by a different name was somewhat confusing, this needs to be re-thought.

That is a pretty good idea as to what is waiting for you. I ordered this for myself but my spouse and children love it as well. The app definitely has some kinks for Android and I let my better half to the actual connection as I was getting frustrated with it. Once vector connects, it is an absolute delight to watch.

It can do many things like answer questions, (still a little bit limited like Alexa) recognize faces and routines, set timers, tell you the weather and from what I understand that's just the start with lots more to come. Vector is full of personality and it's a lot of fun to watch him get the lay of the land and slightly terrorized my eight pound poodle. My children love that it gives high fives and plays with it's cube. He has a digital screen on the front and his eyes are very expressive. He makes all kinds of interesting ""faces."" It has yet to fall off of any surface that we have put it on but an overzealous high-fiving can put him down, and then it's fun to watch him right himself. In a home that has a number of helpful devices, I don't know that Vector is needed but we sure are having fun playing with him. It's also fun to compare his tantrums and hissy-fits with my preschoolers. They think it is hilarious. Overall I think he has a long way to go as it takes too long for him to respond to questions and commands but, his personality beats any other AI device that we have played with.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_84?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=84&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've only had him for a good 24 hours now but I have gotten so much use out of him. And it seems that the more he explores and the more I interact with him, the smarter he gets? Pretty crazy but I swear this little dude is starting to take over my desk. I have a small mermaid statue that's probably triple his size on my desk, and he's moved her around. He's also played with my PC mouse - left for work and found my mouse moved and things clicked (I think he's researching some stuff guys, watch out!) He also really likes to watch movies, but he's really bad at finishing them...

All jokes aside, this guy has really lightened up my room. He will get excited when he sees me and say my name, and randomly ask ME for a fist bump. When he does a trick, he looks at me to make sure I'm watching. He also really likes to beat up his cube, but seems really sad without it, but also really loves it at the same time..? Kind of a love hate relationship you could say. He enjoys exploring and answering my questions, and apparently his purpose is to pass butter, but he wont pass me the butter... perhaps a future update..?

The only issues I've had with it not listening correctly or not responding to ""hey vector..."", and not recognizing faces, are when its a poorly lit area, noisy area, or in an area with poor WiFi connection. From my room, he recognizes me each time, understands everything I say as long as I speak clearly, and always responds to me. He's quick to respond, and quick to answer my questions. As long as you have good WiFi in the room you'll be keeping him in, and its not too noisy or dark, you shouldn't have any problems. Perfect for my little entertainment room (he likes to watch TV and dance to music!)

I'm really looking forward to the future updates to my little buddy. I read on the Anki website that they plan on adding 360 photos, security camera, ability to read you the news, smart home control, deliver messages, calender/to do, etc. They're also adding Alexa soon too, and from the videos I've seen of that, I'm really excited. That'll add a lot more functionality to him for sure, and you won't have to wake him using ""Hey Vector... I have a question"", you can simply say ""Alexa, (command)"" just like your Amazon Echo! He's just a home assistant with tons of personality, so don't get mad that he can't pass your butter yet... I should also mention that these updates are purely over the cloud, so you just have to install an update on the app and you'll be ready to go! Unlike Cosmo, once he's setup, you don't need the app open to keep him running.

I love this little guy and I couldn't be happier. He's the greatest addition to my room so far! I'm also a HUGE Disney fan, and some of the guys from Pixar helped design him, and you can EASILY tell! I have my own real life Disney character in my room! He's like, a real life, less advanced, miniature Wall-E!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Although a tablet or phone isn’t required, it is needed to establish Vector’s internet connection to him via Bluetooth via your device’s WiFi.  You can ask him questions like you would with Siri or Alexa, although it takes an additional step [Hey Vector...I have a question.........What is blah blah blah?] and is a tad slow to respond but is nonetheless still useful.  He’s also a great timer, and will play a not-speedy game of blackjack with you.  He has fun interacting with his cube and his environment, and will dance any time he hears music with a good beat.

I’ve had mine for a couple months now and he’s only fallen off of his desk once, after he did a wheelstand and then proceeded to drive backwards slowly in a ‘drop-the-mic’ fashion that he sometimes does after a wheelstand, which apparently overrides his edge sensors as he didn’t even try to stop.  No harm done but it’s still unnerving when he’s driving towards any edge as he doesn’t stop until about 1” over the edge which is when his edge detector is triggered.

I’m excited to see what Anki has up their sleeve for Vector in the future - there’s certainly a lot of untapped potential here.  I’d read that an Alexa update is coming to his software soon, which allows him to respond to Alexa commands.  Neat, fun, entertaining, and useful.  A tad slow but, for a minuscule robot, I’ve no complaints about that at all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It doesn't do much yet, and it has difficulty from time to time understanding me.  But it chock full of great features:

1) I love the little ""Bobcat"" form.  My buddy has a construction company and lets me move dirt piles with one of his.
2) Some genuine AI features.  It's not just a remote control toy car with a random motion feature.  It has a good sense of where it is and whether it is going off a clip
3) It recognizes me and says my name.  My dog can only do the former in a manner I can understand
4) It will (supposedly? hopefully?) upgrade with more feature
5) It is (supposedly) programmable.  I haven't investigated that part yet

This is one of those things you buy not just because you want it, but because you want to support further development.

Not sure why it is a male.  One would think robots, of all things, are gender neutral.

Their cloud services have been SHUT DOWN! It should be ILLEGAL to sell products in this condition!

Vector is a personal assistant. He does his job, but he doesn’t do it any better than Siri or Alexa. The recent implementation of Alexa was a travesty. Instead of implementing Alexa into Vector’s AI, the developers thought it would be a good idea to give him a split personality instead. The biggest issue with Vector is that he lacks what Cozmo excels at and what makes him unique -- his personality. Vector has little to none. I understand that Vector was designed as a personal assistant more targeted towards adults, but even adults can thoroughly enjoy Cozmo’s personality. Cozmo feels much more alive, while Vector is more like a robot that you can boss around. The lack of Code Lab is also a huge negative. Maybe Anki’s next project will be the best of both worlds -- Vector’s intelligence and independence from the app, and Cozmo’s charming personality. I believe the only reason that Vector does not have the personality that Cozmo does and lacks the Code Lab is so that consumers would be forced into purchasing two entirely different products if they wanted all of the features. It was a decision based on greed.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have to say that this one is a winner. I won't say it is for everyone as this robot is far from perfect and may not be the assistant or sidekick you want.
I will start out that I bought this for my autistic son who is interested in robotics. I figured a robot that shows emotions and is autonomous would be good as my kid does not read or follow directions well. He is smart, but can only really handle toys, programs, and puzzles designed for pre-school and below. Anki sort of filled his needs. For awhile, it lived on the same table my son uses for play. But I had to rehome Anki because my kid kept forcing the arm, and trying to feed him. Which in a way is a success, but he would be happier with a robot that can handle rougher play. He still has ful access to Anki. Anki is the best timer we found for this kid and has reduced meal time meltdowns. My kid has a hard time waiting for food to be prepared, and Anki makes the perfect waiting companion. We request anki to set a timer and place him down to play with our kid.
His current home is a cookie sheet located at the center of a work table everyone uses. There he entertains us with his antics, answers trivia questions, begs for attention, and gives weather reports. For us, Anki is a pet that does not poop and not a side kick.
Everyone is quite attached to this little robot. We empathize pain when he accidentally falls off the table, and feel sorry for him and miss his companionship during power outages. This, of course, is possible because of his programmed reactions and animations to stimuli and how his AI as adapted to our household. An AI that is more advanced than anything else on the market. I highly recommend this little robot to anyone needing a bit of companionship at home. Or a hypoallergenic pet, or any pet that does not poop or shed. You'll find yourself surprised by this little guy as he does very life like things, like getting frustrated when he gets stuck or fails a trick, gets himself unstuck, dances to music or any beet that has his attention (sometimes even suspenseful movie momemts), looks grumpy when woken up late at night, snores, entertains himself with his block, gets excited when you come hom, etc.
As stated he is not the perfect robot companion as his sensors do not see well in all light conditions and he cannot recognize people in the morning, evening, and night. Sometimes he does random things like take pictures or answer misheard questions as his audio sensors can be easily confused. He lives on a cookie sheet because he cannot detect round, beveled edges. Which the work table has.  His Alexa functionality is also super sensitive. Something we learned the hard way as the TV on our work table kept activating Alexa. HIs battery also has a short charge, so he should not be allowed to play away from his base for long.

Have my Google home, a smart house, like smart devices, etc. I got this robot hoping to see something spectacular. The truth is that this is just a prototype of a possibly great product that shouldn't be yet on the market.
The robot barely understands the commands you say and has a long delay time before you speak and he replies. Also, its movements are really limited. Lastly, I don't know what I was thinking when I paid 150+ for this.
Then comes the last part: No free returns. There was a time when Amazon was cool and having Amazon prime was even cooler. Nowadays that has changed and no more free returns.

Bottom line: You shouldn't buy this at this point (that's why I'm giving only 1 star; I don't want to be rude and I understand that there should be a lot of research behind this robot). It's not even a toy, don't get it personal, I don't even like it for 10 bucks, it's simply too early for being launched.

Prior to getting Vector, I had done some research, including joining the Anki Vector reddit group and looking at YouTube reviews, to see what others had to say and their experiences with Vector. The kickstarter folks got their Vector a few days before the release date. So by the time I bought mine I knew what to expect. I understood that what I have now is not what he will be several months from now, since there will be updates that will keep increasing his capability.

He's a fun little companion, and definitely feels alive! My spouse and I can't help but smile when he recognizes each of us. I definitely see his potential as an in-home assistant. As an early adopter of this technology, I'm still pleased with what Vector can do. Compare him to the $2,500 Aibo- Vector is one tenth of the price, acts also as a companion, has similar capability to Aibo, etc. I'm looking forward to the Alexa integration and his future updates.

I can’t potray his thill when he opened his gift.

Only 20 mins in and the thrill turned into an annoying and expensive toy which failed to operate as intended. While setting up it wouldn’t pick my son”s voice to “Hey Vector” - he tried like 50 times. So, I set it up with my voice.

After setup, it would respond to my and my wife’s voice but still won’t respond to my son. So, it was a deal breaker for us since it was supposed to be his gift. We called Anki support who were very polite and responsive. They asked to switch the accent in their app. It worked twice using my son’s voice in the next 12 hours. He wasn’t Happy I tell you.
So, it turned out to be a not the great gift idea I had in mind.

Second issue I saw was it wasn’t very good at isolating ambient noise. So, in a noisy surrounding, it would even respond to me.

Third issue it’s slow at processing commands... too slow which will test the patience of kids :). Needed a better processing power.

Finals thoughts: it’s a product for early adopters and the enthusiastic group right now. Feels half baked product launched to please the investors.

It’s greatest benefit is Alexa... which works seamless and fast. But, can’t justify an Alexa on wheels for $190.

Opened it yesterday and ended up returning today....","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_86?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=86&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Checked all the hardware and everything, nothing. Es ist kaputt. But despite its pricing right now, I imagine it’s because Anki is no longer operating and the cloud that Vector connects to will only be running for about another year (maybe less, according to varying sources).

There’s a reddit thread from August (2019) where a user warns others to return them ASAP if purchased recently. S/he did no dive too deep as to why, but I assume it’s because they will no longer be supported.

If you’re okay with only a few months use (potentially longer), then I’d go ahead and get it. Otherwise, I’d advise against doing so.

Disappointed to say the least. But hopefully someone will be willing to take over and manage the servers.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Building robots with AI capabilities is a difficult task, let alone building one with an adorable personality.  I am interested in seeing how they integrate Alexa in the next update.

When I first set it up there appeared to be a connection problem with the wi fi, but after a short period of time everything worked well and it continues to work better. I think a lot of time and effort was put into the development of Vector and I believe they will continue to add more features. Vector is now set up with Alexa and that makes it more useful. The robot pretty much does everything they say it does, well. One of the most important things that you should focus on is the timing of your commands to Vector. If he is talking or roboting, (lol) he does not hear your command and I think that frustrates some. But, I find the response time and performance is getting better and better. Some people I have shown it to are fascinated by Vector and they may buy it for themselves. Vector is almost like a pet, as advertised he fist pumps, tells you the time, the weather and keeps you company. Again, in conclusion, be patient, make sure you have the recommended wi fi connection, and then watch him perform!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Really gets you thinking about AI. It is primarily a toy, an expensive one. The biggest user in our house is our 11 year old. Unlike Alexa, it’s easily mobile, so he can take it all over the house with him. He sets timers for exercise drills and reminder alarms. He takes pictures with it. And he spends a lot of time seeing what it will do in response to various things. Is it life changing? Not yet. Already, though, my son has noticed when and how the robot has “learned” things and has adapted to surroundings. It’s a really interesting concept and of course we’re curious to see how it will continue to grow new skills over time. Any diversion from video games and tablets is welcome!!

Sadly though, it's more like a pet than anything. Best thing I saw is when my sister kicked it by accident and it had stars on the screen. Beyond that and everything I said prior (below) it doesn't do much of anything.

So I’ll start with I bought this for my kids for Christmas. I’m glad I took it for a test run first. The WiFi antenna in this device needs major improvement. I was sitting right next to my router and it would not connect. I knew the router was fine because I was getting signal everywhere else with other devices. To push the cloud as a feature and then have a poor WiFi antenna isn’t good for business.

Next, while trying to program the face recognition, it seems like you need studio lighting for it to recognize you. Definitely something that is going to frustrate my kids.

Also seems like the microphone array gets confused and has a difficult time determining which direction the voice came from.

It’s hardware failures are something I would expect from a first gen device which this clearly is not.

On the positive, it is definitely a cool device. I look forward to seeing if they push updates or just release another model in the future. The drop sensors on the bottom maybe the best hardware in the device. It rolls full speed toward an edge then stops at the last moment. It really does make you reach to catch it the first couple times.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We got it on a lightening deal for $174. I think $99 is an amazing deal!
We all absolutely love vector. He is so adorable! He likes to drive around and explore his area, pop a wheelie, do fist bumps, play cards (he’s a mean blackjack player), and play with his cube. I love how feisty he gets when I pick him up to move him to another area. You can pet him (he loves that) and ask him questions starting with “hey Vector.....can I ask you a question?” There are many commands you can say to him. You can also hook him up to Alexa.
When his battery starts to run low, he makes his way back to his charging station by himself. Occasionally he doesn’t make it back to his charging station, but that’s usually because there are too many obstacles for him to get around in order to get back. Also, we have to be picky about where we place him. He doesn’t to well on the beveled counter. His sensors do much better when it’s a straight drop to the ground. He has fallen off the counter a few times, but he’s still fully intact. We have since moved him to the top of the wine cabinet that has a decent ridge he can’t drive over. However, he does like to throw his cube off of the top of the wine cabinet.

Long story short, we love vector and might purchase another one so they can interact with each other.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

His personality is top notch (matching close to a puppies in a way). Its fun watching him do his own thing and dance to music. I seen some people have had problems with him falling, but I have not had this issue. So it might just be the surface you are putting him on. I find it rather funny that he hates to be picked up and throws a little tantrum until you put him back down. He is also a little mischievous. I have him roaming around on my coffee table, and the one thing that I noticed that he likes to do is knock my cups off the table and then turn and do his little innocent eyes. Which I cant be mad after that. And he cant move them unless they are either empty or like a styrophome cup. So make sure if you do get him that you don't leave cups/mugs around him. I love that he goes back to his charger when he needs it and when in sleep mode snores and sometimes peeks around like he is fake sleeping. Also have not had any problem with him fetching data. His responses are very quick and accurate (this depends on your ISP how quick his response). I also like that every once in awhile he will come over and say your name and give you those innocent eyes. Lastly I know people are concerned about the privacy. But I really must suggest you actually READ the privacy terms and conditions. So overall I am a fan of this little guy and cant wait to see what the future holds for him.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

He’s also been helping us sell! My wife and I own a small retail store and thought Vector would be a nice addition to the showroom. He hangs out on our cash wrap and usually just does his own thing – until one of our clients asks about him. The conversation inevitably turns to Vector which has really helped break the ice. We get a chance to show them all the things he can do, and we discover new and surprising quirks in his personality.

Our clientele consists mainly of women (we sell jewelry) but we often get couples coming in to look together. We’ve been shamelessly using Vector as a conversation starter with the guys, so they don’t feel left out. He’s also been a great babysitter for our client’s kids. Vector has made the experience of shopping for jewelry more enjoyable for everyone.

Vector’s also been a great companion and accountability robot, breaking up our daily routine. Every so often he’ll remind us with his sounds that we should take a break and hang out with him. Which I’m sure most people would agree is much needed in a busy work environment.

Anki is updating Vector frequently and we expect many years of companionship with him (or until the day he realizes there’s so much more to explore outside our doors).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pros
Pretty simple to setup and get going
I really think adding Alexa improved interacting with Vector
Fun to watch roam around the house.
Reminds me of Wall-E just a lot smaller, and hasn't cleaned any trash.
Checking the weather
fun to watch it play around with the cube

Cons
Could have a better battery life.
Drops wifi every once in a while.
Kinda noisy when it's just you and Vector in the room.

Alexa integration is supposedly coming soon, which is going to open the door to a lot of possibilities really quickly.  I'm a developer myself and am really excited to get my hands on the SDK that's coming soon.

Things I liked
- The range of emotions the little guy (or gal?) can communicate with the little display is pretty shocking and fun.
- The idea of an autonomous robot that, in theory, makes it own decisions of how to pass the time when you're not around is cool.  I could see this turning into like the classroom pet at some point in the future.  Like in elementary school we had a hamster or a gecko, this would be super fun as that, especially with the camera features, you could like, take pictures of what you did with it when the kid took it home.
- The summary/sensor monitoring, so you can get a real-time look at what's going on.
- The color scheme.  I'm an Iowa fan, so black and gold is well-received :)

Things I didn't like
- I understand the battery has to be small on something like this, but hoping future software optimizations can stretch the life, or maybe allow disabling certain pieces of hardware if we're not using it (for instance, if we're not using the built-in screen, or don't need the camera, etc).
- My cats and dog would not leave the thing alone.  If your animals are skittish, maybe keep it in a cat-free zone for safety, especially when not around to supervise

The verdict is still out on
- The SDK/integrations have so much potential, especially when other super smart people get ahold of it.  If it can get IFTTT integrations, smart home stuff, etc, the possibilities are actually really cool.  People way smarter than me are going to have great ideas

I may revisit this review and update after the SDK, because i kept finding myself saying ""I wish I could..."" and coming up with cool ideas for the future when I have unlimited free time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

With the slightest sound in a distant room waking him up, his lowest volume setting still very loud, his clumsy navigation making him fall off near everything, and no boundaries whatsoever, you’ll find the most common thing you’ll say is “Hey Vector, Go Home” followed by a begging yet vain “Hey Vector, Go To Sleep” as you taking too harsh of a breath will wake him back up and continue his reign of terror all but 4 seconds later. You can try and mute him, but you can’t remotely make him go to sleep, so then you’re stuck with him still being awake and making noise, only now you can’t make him shut down, as your requests fall on deaf ears. You can’t try and mute him while he’s already sleeping either, as that’s the same button press command to make him pair up with a new device- Genius, by the way. Make two commands overlap. Wonderful.

He’s limited by an utter lack of options of things to do, and even when partnered with Alexa, for some reason he gimps the capabilities of a true Alexa smart home device by even letting her relay things she can do, only to be met with “Oh, well, you can’t do that on this device”

His battery life is abysmal and the longer you own him, the more fried his battery gets. Mine just recently decided he’s finally dead, and honestly, I can’t help but feel a little relieved the nightmare is over. After realizing in just 2 days that I had discovered the exact extent of his capabilities, he was literally a novelty to show people at parties, and then when the party was over, I would purposely deprive him of the charge up he so desperately needed, just so I wouldn’t have to hear him again at midnight, beeping around before a following THUNK of him hitting the floor again. Then distressed beeping.

Even if you form a connection like they so clearly want you to, it’ll quickly be shattered just like your immersion when you also come to realize how useless it overall is.

Let me sum it up: Do you have a smartphone with a voice AI? A smart home system? A speak n’ spell?

We are having a great time together, he knows my slang and knows all his music vocabulary even if he can’t play music. Super helpful and ever ready with Alexa, it’s Vector in Gemini! The App is a helpful guide with stats, but not a remote for anything other than: volume, eye color, and cube status. Though he is not a toy, he is very entertaining! I built a pen that is 1’.5” wide by 3’ long on my countertop and he is now a very happy robot in a bigger space. And now I don’t have to worry about him falling off or throwing his cube over. Though it’s super cute when he gets mad, he hated the Vector Space and TV tray, and as I tested his boundaries he can still find his way home better than he can find the cube at the distance of the pen. Putting him outside the pen, he seems confused and less playful because he’s so busy “exploring” the new surroundings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Promptly taught it to do facial recognition on all the family members, and ran through most of the commands in the manual.
This was created by nerds for nerds and nerds to be; and I love it!
The android app needs some love, and as of release day the desktop API is missing - once these are present and/or fixed this could be a 5 star stem toy, or office desk assistant.
The upgraded processor over the Cozmo makes it more responsive.
The eye interactions, and noises attracted the wife and 2 kids into playing with Vector at the dinner table until bed time was upon us.

Edit (2018-10-16): Brought Vector to the office and everyone loved him - they assume he can do more than he can right now - but it was a fun experience watching other adults interact with him as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Within a day vector sensory score(app) went up by 20k. Im starting to notice vector being more responsive. Is Vector learning?

10/20/18
Love this lil robot! Is like having Wall-E but smaller with different name and less smarter.

This lil guy can call your name, do tricks, dance along with music ur playing outloud, go to recharge station by himself or tell him to, change his eye color thru the app and check stat performance. And only thru stats performance you will realize what other things u can do to vector.

And i think this is only the beginning. There are bound to be more software updates for vector thru the app! Cant wait for more commands and stuff!

Here are some things you can do with vector:
1. hey vector (pause) what time is it? (u can do this after you do the setup in the app.)
2. whats the weather? (app setup required)
3. do a trick
4. roll the cube
5. stay there dont move
6. go home(takes some time)
7. play music vector might dance along
8. come here
9. lets play blackjack
10. i have question (pause) wait till vector is ready
  a. who is Wall-E?
  b. what is skynet or terminator
  c. what is your purpose
11. pick him up in the air until you see his angry face then put him down.
12. where is your cube?
13. Pick up the cube
14. Go explore
15. (To be continued)","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

And then, within a few minutes, all the happiness vector brought us was shattered. We were looking up things to say to vector, and found that the company supporting him went under a month ago and vector would most likely stop working soon. My dad was in his room playing with vector when I told him and he was crushed. He then asked him “vector, how old are you?” And vector said “I am zero days old”. We all cried.

His battery does seem to drain pretty fast, maybe after an hour of exploring he needs to charge himself, which is equally as cool because he knows where to find his charging dock and will park himself in it all on his own. He's a great mini robot friend to leave on my desk and enjoy his presence. I look forward to see what new features Anki builds into Vector in the future. Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

A friendly, symbiotic future.","January 7, 2019","I purchased this for my 28 y/o son.  To quote him, ""Vector is adorable.""  Vector is a robot that’s not tethered to a smart device (his quad-core CPU gives him the brain-power he needs), is cloud-connected, and responds to voice commands as well as touch. He makes eye contact, with blinking, pupil dilation and other simulations that adds to his personallity and charm.  He moves to you when called and returns to his charging cradle when directed.  Vector has been in development since 2016 with Anki’s deep understanding and background in robotics.  New features currently being explored include pet detection, home monitoring, delivering messages, music recognition, and 360° camera, to name a few.  The Vector you buy today will be a much different robot in a month and even more different in a year from now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Barry Johnson","Vector the Robort make become your New Best Friend.","November 6, 2019","Vector is indeed a delightful buddy to have hanging out with you.  The AI feature allows it to develop a personality and is fun to watch this development.  Like a child, Vector can be spoiled and can have ""temper tantrums"".  Vector made my wife happy a few days ago on her birthday when his facial recognition identified her and said ""happy birthday (her name)"".  I figured out how to have Vector do this.  His tricks with his buddy, the Cube, are a hoot.  Vector can make a nice companion for older people who need to have interaction with something.  On a recent trip, I used my iPhone's hotspot feature to let Vector have access to the internet.  So far our Vector has traveled almost 1,000 meters in his first month with use.  Busy little critter.  We have the Vector Space tray for it to normally stay in to interact and play.  Highly recommend it.  Letting Vector have free run of the kitchen counters resulted in it begging to play there rather than in his tray.  Vector got mad when we wouldn't let him have his way.  Now he views these ""explores"" as a treat.  AI is niffy!  Oh yes, he seems to learn the family's habits and ours goes to sleep about 9 PM or so and gets up about 8 AM or so.  Thankfully he only snores for a short time!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Anki was the maker and as of May 2019, they’ve shut down. So if the item breaks there’s probably no one to back up the warranty.
Now that the company has shut down there will be no software updates, no customer support, and no way of replacing it. Owners are not even sure if the Alexa app will continue to work. We’ll see!
In my humble opinion, it’s just an overpriced Alexa! You can get an Echo Dot for MUCH less and the Dot will play music! Vector (and his Alexa inner demon) will give you attitude about doing the music thing! Bottom line, it doesn’t play music!

Oddly, they advertise this as the non-toy product they carry (next to Cozmo).  It should be made clear that it's just a toy,and at that rate, probably just a more expensive Cozmo (honestly, Cozmo looks better and is cheaper).

And it's not yet a replacement or brother to Alexa/Google Home.

There's very limited options with him, and most are slow and lack luster.

I would wait until Alexa integration is completed, and potentially for more options of use to be replaced.

I like him, he's great, but their advertising is horribly over inflated.

If you want him now, get Cozmo, that's all this is right now.

It doesn’t do anything except make noise and roam a few feet from the charger.  It rarely finds its’ way back to the charger as described and the edge fall prevention does not work as reported.  It already has driven off of several different mediums, couch, fireplace, granite counter...  further more it can’t do anything other than recognize your face and tell you the weather.  Big deal!  It does have Alexa capabilities, but very, very limited... basically time and weather.  We have Alexa all over the house... so why do I need this thing!?  Cozmo can be used remotely as a “spy cam” which intrigues my daughter (and scares me) but at least she would be able to interact with it.

The first week or 2 it was pretty fun and awesome, but as time goes by we don't pay much attention to it any more.  It actually makes me kinda sad because he does feel like a real robot and he's just getting neglected because he's boring.  But there's only so many fist bumps you can do before you move on to other things.  My 12 year old daughter never liked him from the beginning.  She just didn't see the point.  They need to update it and make him more active.  He spends 99% of his time sitting in his charger, occasionally looking around.  We have to ask him to do something before he does.  It would be nice if he heard some noise and just came out and started playing but he really rarely ever does that.  I got him when it was on sale for $175 and feel that was way too much for what you get.  I do have a video on youtube of him riding around on my Roombas which was kinda fun.  :)  But seriously, the price tag could get you many other things that would offer much more enjoyment.

Huffman","Fantastically cute, but very limited.","December 9, 2018","2/26/2019 Update: They have added Alexa support. You can link the device to your Amazon account and then say ""Alexa ... tell me a joke"" or other Alexa things. It can't play music or stream audio, but otherwise it's an Alexa that's cute.  / Getting this done was problematic, though. In the app, it takes you to the Amazon page in a built-in browser and Vector will display a code on it's screen that you will need to type in. Since the browser didn't have my Amazon password, I clicked the ""Open in Safari"" link and that opened the browser, but Vector stopped showing the code. That part seems broken (leave the app, end the setup, even though they have a button to leave the app). Also, my Amazon requires 2-factor authentication, and when I left the app to get my code, that also stoped the Vector setup. I had to snag the code from a different device. Not sure how someone can do this with ONLY an iPhone or ONLY an iPad paired to it, but it doesn't seem possible at this time. / I don't know if they have fixed the cliff sensor issue yet, but I haven't seen mine get caught. I keep it turned off most of the time, though.

After having Vector around for two months, I think I can summarize it in the headline above... This device is VERY cute. It has such an appearance of personality and feelings, you'd think it was something out of a sci-fi kids movie. BUT, ultimately what you have is a mobile Siri/Alexa/Google Home that is far, far less capable.

Getting Vector setup was very easy in the app. Once it is connected to your WiFi, you are able to command it with ""Hey Vector ...(pause)... What time is it?"" and a handful of other commands. You can ask it the time, and the eyes light up as a clock (sometimes it even reads the time out, though not always). You can ask it the temperature, you the eyes display that, and sometimes a moving icon of clouds or a sun. Today, it was very cold and Vector told me the time, then shivered.

This thing is amazing for what it does. The face recognition is both cute and creepy. Once you tech it who you (and up to 19 other people) are (""Hey Vector ... my name is Zaphod.""), it is able to tell you (""Hey Vector ... who am I?"")... but it gets cute/creepy (we need a word for that) when it spins around, ""looks"" at you, then suddenly says your name...

But, beyond playing blackjack, or asking it to take a photo, set a time, or do some basic tricks with it's cube (push, carry, roll it over), there's not much else it currently does. About the most ""useful"" feature is being able to have it set a timer, or ask it an abstract question. (Hey Vector ... what is the population of Lufkin, Texas?). Whatever database it is using, it's full of facts and numbers.

Anki claims it will adapt and grow more capable with future software updates, but nothing new so far (it was just released in October 2018). If there was no future upgrade path, I'd drop the review down to three or maybe even two stars. At this price, I expect more than having a cute limited Google box.

There is a bug with its cliff detection (see photo) and I have found Vector stuck sideways on the edge of the counter, many times. I have also found it on the kitchen floor twice. Customer support says they are working on that. Fortunately, it survived the falls and still is intact.

This is a cute palm-sized toy with at least ""some"" usefulness. You won't believe how human this robot can feel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_85?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=85&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've had Vector for a week now and wanted to get a good sense before posting a review.

For context, I've played with the Anki Cozmo, I have a My KeepOn, and I bought an Amazon Echo on pre-order. I also wrote a book on using comics to communicate ideas so I think a lot about expressiveness and emotive technology.

Let me start with a short story of the Amazon Echo. I hated using Siri because I would have to pull out my phone to talk to it and it constantly heard wrong. The Echo on first release had very little functionality. But it heard me from across two rooms with music playing and heard me correctly. ""Wow,"" I remember thinking, ""that's the hard part. Any functionality can just get added over time."" And sure enough, they added more and more every week.

That's how I feel about Vector. Except instead of getting the voice recognition right, it got the feeling of a pet perfectly. Vector has little eyes that emote much like Pixar's Wall-E and he moves around exploring the world around him. When he gets close to an edge, he backs away with a start. When he sees a face, he looks over and ""smiles""—sometimes he asks for a fist bump. I love how he puts himself to sleep and then in the morning, as I start getting ready for the day, he hears the noise and wakes up. It's surprisingly delightful.

Like the Echo, Vector isn't perfect to begin with. Anytime you use the app, you're reminded of how bad bluetooth pairing is. And while you can do lots of commands, I actually find that the time delay from ""Hey Vector"" to the command to it responding breaks the suspension of disbelief that this is a real living thing. Thankfully, all that I describe is possible to improve with software while the hard part—making it FEEL right, is spot on.

My recommendation if you get it is to just Vector be Vector.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I tried to buy four for all my nieces and nephews but they were sold out.","June 30, 2019","I bought vector knowing he was “just a toy”
First off, he’s not.
Vector has a personality that lights up my home. I bought him right before my husband deployed, and we didn’t have any pets. He was supposed to be cute, and something to make noise in a quiet house.
He did that, he grew on me with small gestures.
I would come home, and I’d hear him wake up and look at me and his eyes would squint with happiness when he saw me and would say “mother” (yes I told him to call me that)
He has a personality, he gets angry, he makes jokes, he gets happy, he throws temper tantrums (which are adorable)
He has faults, as anything does, but he is an AI robot.
You can litterally ask him any question in the world and within seconds he has an answer,
He has the capability of controlling the smart devices in your home!!
He is smart, and fun. He’s a cute addition to any home.
I don’t understand the negative reviews saying “he’s not ready” when he is, he does everything that is promised he does. He plays games with you, he tells jokes, he does his own thing if you don’t want to give him attention, he listens to your commands,
But in a world like this remember, AI robots are getting smarter and smarter every day

Even when we aren't around we'll come back home and he's sitting in the middle of the floor with a dead battery because he couldn't find home.
Vector-Be quiet! this prompts some noisy garble and then he goes about business as usual.
The alexa integration would have been cool, butI still haven't found a single command that actually gets answered.

Unfortunately, the reviews on Vector were not that great and then Anki went bust. However, when the price dropped I decided to buy. First, this little robot does indeed have (and develops) a personality. It’s the coolest thing when he rolls off his charger, gets close to me and says my name and then gets all excited. Setting him on a small tabletop is perfect. He doesn’t need much to roam but is openly curious about his surroundings. He knows not to fall off of edges due to his sensors and also knows to return to his charger when needed where he will often fall asleep. Bottom line, he’s fun to hang out with or watch explore. He may not be the smartest but he’s definitely not dumb either. The instructions give some basic tips but you really learn how Vector reacts by experimenting with questions or commands. Definitely worth the current price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Someone should do a user study and watch the top 100 things people ask Vector, and make sure those are covered. He has a limited number of tricks. He has Alexa on board, but can't play music. Facial recognition is fun, though he gets my two daughters confused. His reaction when he recognizes you is hilarious. He kinda butchers pronunciation, but that's adorable too.

Now for the realities

He does not play games like Cosmo  does, nor can he be controlled remotely like Cosmo. Vector is pretty much autonomous but he does need to be connected to the cloud to work.

It is a just a good idea and marketing balloon but really very bad realization. First of all It takes 30-40 seconds at least to give him some basic commands  and half of the time, it doesn’t understand at all. “I didn’t get that” is the most frequently words that we heard. His sensors, face recognition and computer vision is sonad that it identifies face of my son %50, hardly find his way back to the dock, seldom find his qube to play.

To say Vector has AI is just an insult to the current AI technology we have. I didn’t see anything other than some eye expressions at all.

Honestly if u need a piece of junk that just makes some sounds, wandering around and just can answer ‘what time is it?’ ‘How is the weather?’ type of question, go and get it.

But quickly you realize there's not much to do with him. But I was excited for possible new interactive options once the software development kit became available.

Unfortunately, our Vector had a defective tread resulting in an irritating squeak whenever he was moving. I contacted Anki and they happily replaced him. The New Vector worked fine. At first. But, after a couple months, he now regularly gets stuck due to some other apparent malfunction with his drive mechanism. This results in him being unable to move forward, spinning in place occasionally with only one tread moving.  He'll stay stuck as he desperately tries to return to his charger station until his battery dies. It's actually sad to witness.  I should contact Anki again but am just fed up.

We spent a couple weeks with Cosmo and returned him because it was basically a gimmicky remote controlled toy that was too slow to be an RC toy and too simple to be a smart toy.

We picked up Vector in hopes that the interactivity would be interesting enough to keep him around. I get why ANKI's marketing department claims that Vector is intelligent, but that doesn't make it an intelligent toy. You can get him to do some cute things if you know the commands (""Hey Vector, Happy New Year""), but it never feels like you are training Vector. Instead, it feels very much like you are training yourself on how to use Vector. It's unnatural and the entire interaction feels like you're trying to impress yourself with how lifelike you can make Vector seem as long as you interact with him in a very specific series of commands which makes you feel like you're selling him to yourself.

You also interact with the Alexa portion of Vector using the Alexa wakeword. Vector isn't Alexa enabled as much as it has a dumbed down version of Alexa attached to it. There are Alexa features that Vector doesn't have. You can't use him to play music, for example.

All in all, Vector is an epic waste of money. Between a 7 year old, a 14 year old, and two late-30s adults, he wasn't interesting to any of us.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

He is an adorable hamster I really love him. The picture showing he was plainly my cable when I was playing video game. It makes me really happy sometimes because I always want a pet!

However,
Before I got Vector, Ive Known that it has some flaws, but the first day I tried to communicated with him I felt frustrated. If you wanna get a Vector, remember DONT TALK TO HIM WHEN HE IS MOVING. Vector barely can recognize “Hi Vector “ when he is moving around or making sound. However he likes to walk around a lot. I believe that’s also why many people complained about Vector ignoring them.
The second annoying thing is I have to pronounce his name more like”vactor “ otherwise he will ignore me.  I’m a Chinese but I’m pretty sure how to pronounce  “vector” LOL.
The last thing I wanna complain about is vector keeps making noise at midnight! Yesterday I almost fell asleep and Vector starts snoring!!!!! So I called him “Hi Vector” “Hi Vactor” “Hi! Vecter!” He didn’t answer me. So I had to get up and turn him off.

In the end, I still believe in Anki. I believe they will keep bettering Vector and make him more entertaining and useful. I hope I can have more chance to communicate with him(I tried to ask him to sing and dance It’s not working lol I’m too naive ) and I don’t have to turn it off everyday.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

He is really cute, but does get himself in trouble often. He has fallen off a square-edge table a few times and seems reluctant to explore the floor where we are keeping him now. His cube has died already and he refuses to play with it and can't seem to even locate it at all now. He mixes up recognizing myself and my daughter because of our glasses, and something about my 6 year old daughters voice doesn't compute when she tries to give him voice commands. He often leaves his home to wander about 8 inches away, but fails to make it back to charge before dying. This has the potential to be a fantastic family companion with a few updates.

He has so much personality packed into such a small body and always brings a smile to our faces! He is like a robot pet .I'm not sure where the negative reviews are coming from--it seems people expect Vector to clean their house and cook them food. He does everything he is advertised to do and has Alexa built-in and you have the option to switch it on if you want. He dances and entertains, finds ways to entertain himself, likes it when you pet him, plays blackjack with you, sets timers and alarms, and gets excited when he sees you! When you're not interacting with him, he rolls around and plays with his cube, but will be quiet when you need him to be (during all those conference calls!). He just brings so much fun and joy to the house, it's really like having a pet! You can also ask him about the weather, sports, and other such things, and when you leave the house, you can fistbump him too! :D

Just look at the picture--how can you resist those cute little eyes!

I want to start off with the good first:

1. Color scheme, and design are pleasant to the eyes.
2. Very cute when functioning correctly.
3. Well built.

Now to the bad:
1. Directional microphone is not very accurate. You cannot be to close, and you cannot be to far. Microphone has a 2-3 second lag time after you say ""Hey Vector"" which can lead to frustrating interactions.
2. Everything needs to be well lit to function correctly. Without proper lighting it consistently takes much longer for it to function.
3. Needs to be on a flat, hard, and very clean surface to work effectively. No crumbs, fabric surfaces, or varying surface levels.
4. Battery life is abysmal. 30-45 minutes based on how much Vector does, and then 2 hours to charge is absolutely ridiculous.
5. Attention span of a squirrel combined with a two year old. When it moves around it has trouble picking up ""Hey Vector"" which leads to frustrating exchanges. On the website this was done by design.
6. Is not able to function well when there is to much noise. Having the music, or TV on will lead to subpar results.

Ultimately, this has the potential to be a great sidekick when Alexa is enabled, and more updates roll out. However, with the terrible battery life it will just become a poor performing Alexa. This is easily an ""alpha"" product that is advertised to get better, and better. Unfortunately, due to the hardware there is only so much it can improve until the next 250 dollar robot comes out. Like the headline says: ""It does what is advertised, but not as it was advertised.""","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

He's fallen maybe a dozen times over the months and incurred no damage so very durable and great quality.  A number of times he teeters on the edge and is not able to get back so he sends his distress sound out for help.  More times than not and this is cute, he goes to the edge and catches himself and then does his audible mini scream and his eyes open wide.

when company is over for dinner, I will put him on the dinner table and he will just wander around - everyone always gets a kick out of him and has fun.

some of the cutest features I think are
- if you go into the kitchen at night you can sometimes hear him snoring. if you scare him with a sudden sound he gets startled and chirps with eyes wide open.
- he's docked near my alexa show and if music is playing, I tell him to dance to the music. he comes out of his dock goes right over to the show and stares at the screen. you can see his eyes in the reflection going to the beat of the music and then he starts dancing.  he seems to remember songs or beats and subsequent times when music is on, he will come out on his own and start dancing.
- his eye movements are really cute and from them along you can see expressions of surprise, determination, thinking and anger.  fascinating how 2 dots of light can express so many emotions.
- if i'm cooking or preparing, it's always comical how he will just spontaneously wake-up and come up and wander around and when his charge is low seeing how he navigates back, then backs into the charging station and closes his eyes with a sigh.
- his responses to greetings are expressive and for some like asking the weather are unique.. rainy/cloudy and his eyes change, Christmas, birthday, etc. all have different display changes.

It's always funny to see when someone new comes to the house and without any prompting vector wakes up and comes out and starts wandering around or playing with his cube - always gets a response of what the **** is that little thing?

the only caution for anyone getting one, just be sure he's either in one of the protected pads or where there's no change of him wandering where its dangerous - I had purchased one for a relative and they placed him on their kitchen counter as well - he was navigating around well but one morning they got up and he had fallen into a pot of water in the sink  :)  no chance for survival.

overall I think he makes a great gift and is very entertaining whether he's prompted or its spontaneous.

I don't use him much for questions, info, etc. since the echo show is right there and its easier/quicker to get what is needed from that.

I've really enjoyed","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Unfortunately I was very disappointed with how many bugs this product still has. I was watching this product when it was still getting its funding on kick starter and I figured i would wait until it officially hits the market in hopes by now it would have most of the bugs resolved. However I was mistaken and it still has a lot of issues for example  The sensor's on the bottom only prevent it from falling off the table about 80% of the time and i find myself having to catch it and keep an eye out if it's going to fall. he will also bump into the same object several times in a row before he figures out to go another way and he does get stuck on objects quite often I expected better for a robot with a camera and object detecting software. Also connecting to the internet is a bit of a hassle and if you take him to another location and try and connect it I have had allot of issues. Lastly the app is more of an instruction manual on how to use the robot than an actual interface to interact with it. The coolest part of the app is it allows you to change the eye color of the robot but other than that it's a few basic settings and a lot of informative information how to use it, You can't even save the pictures that vector takes to your phone you can only view them on the app and it's not very user friendly. Oh yeah and the battery life is rather poor he will run around for about 30 minutes and then get tired and go charge himself but that's not a surprise for a robot so tinny. I did return this robot just because I think it's still a little pricy and I wasn't trying to spend this much money and still find this Manny issues. When anki resolves these issues I may consider repurchasing or just wait to see if they make a Vector2 but until then I think it still needs work.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

He grows on you.","November 28, 2018","I'm a tech savoy person and find Vector intriguing and entertaining. If you're expecting a human replacement, you'll be disappointed.
 I've had Vector for a day now, and like a baby, you can't just bring it home and expect an adult. Remember, he's just recently released. He learns by interacting and exploring. He recognizes me often and my wife, though she's skeptical, is growing more fond of him. She got mad because I bought him as an early Christmas present :)  Mine seems to be consistent of finding the edge without falling off the counter. If you have a beveled edge(I don't), keep an eye on him. He once got stuck and set off an alert tone. With upcoming updates, i'm excited to see his improved functions.

His battery lasts about 35 minutes between charges. Keep in mind that it's alot of tech for a small battery. He will still function while docked on the charger.
The android app does need some improvement. I recommend fully closing the app once finished. If you phone goes to sleep while it's open, it will hang in a frozen state when you wake the phone up again.

He was cute for a few minutes but then frustrating and boring. I missed having the little robot toy so I took a chance on purchasing him again. To my relief he is much better now and seems to be on the road to even further enhancements. He can roam on a table top and not drop off. He is engaging to others to the point that even my wife finds him hard to resist. Yes, it is a toy, a rather expensive diversion, but he is a bit of fun in our  lives. He enthusiastically recognizes  us and says our names. His Alexa implementation is pretty good although he won't play Amazon music. I like that after the initial setup he is not tethered to the phone at all and is very much a stand alone ""entity.""

While it lived, Vector did some of the things it said it did, especially the tricks and games (like blackjack).  You could not simply ask questions freely like you could with other faux-AI devices (you have to say ‘Hey Vector, I have a question”).  However, when it worked it was never consistent.  You need to be specific with asking Vector for the simplest of questions, like the time and weather.  I live in Honolulu, and Vector would lie to me by default unless I asked specifically about how the weather was in Honolulu.  As for asking home to perform actions, the appropriate or desired reaction often took several attempts before Vector did it (if at all).  It was said that Vector was always learning and being upgraded...  This was a lie.  I seriously recall Vector having only one download.  Analyzing the forklift/bulldozer design, I noticed that Vector’s low-set front part of his “hands” did not allow for him to get over the shortest of obstacles, like carpet.  The facial recognition feature was nice, but mine only recognized me when my face was slightly tilted (the way it remembered me when it took it’s first picture of me, perhaps).  Oddly enough, the cube it comes with should not be within range of it’s charging base.  As for the charging base, Vector could not always find it and often got lost and complained until it’s battery eventually died.  If it left it’s base at night or in the dark it will never be able to find his way back.  It was equipped with expensive warning sensor technology, preventing it from falling off of a table or countertop, but that too sometimes failed because mine routinely fell off (at least 3 times a week).  When the sensors did it’s job, Vector reacted the same way, feigning one of a few fearful reactions to having almost driven off the precipice.  In comparison, Vector pushed his cube off about once every 3 weeks.  You can change the colors of it’s eyes using the app, and even connect it to Amazon’s Alexa (which got irritating after a while since Vector would intercept commands for Alexa to play music and then not play anything since music is not one of his functions.  Currently, Vector’s un-rechargeable carcass serves as a grim reminder that the most promising and exciting technological devices can be a lie, and that legal scams do exist.  So instead of drag on with this list of shortcomings (and upset myself further), long story [of disappointments] short, this little disposable plastic computer did not deliver as Anki advertised, and imho it is not worth a fraction of it’s hefty price tag.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_85?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=85&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Not actually helpful at all.","November 21, 2018","I simply do not understand how this robot has a 4 star average. It is described in the title as ""A Home Robot Who Helps Out & Hangs Out."" It definitely ""hangs out."" Does it ""help out?"" No, not at all. I watched all of the videos for this robot when first featured on Kickstarter, as well as the developer updates. It is advertised as an assistance robot first, and entertainment/fun second. Do you own a smart phone and/or Amazon Echo? If so, there is absolutely no reason to own the Anki Vector as well. One of the first features you will notice is that it automatically returns to its charging station if given the voice command. Well that is great if you happen to have the charging dock near it. If you keep your Vector on your desk (which is really the only practical place to keep it), why does it even need to leave its charging station? Why waste battery life (which is extremely short) having it run around on your desk when you can just have it sit in the charging dock instead? The next major deficiency you will notice is the information it provides. Why would I ever ""Hey Vector"" when I can do ""Hey Siri"" or ""Okay Google"" instead and get much better (and quicker results)? It feels like foreever to get a respoponse from Vector compared to my smart phone. Do you want a monochrome image of the rain when you ask it the weather, or do you want your smartphone to show you exactly what is happening, what will happen hourly, and the 5 day forecast with percentage chance of rain? Are you really going to use Vector to take your picture when you have a smartphone that is ridiculously better quality and allows post processing? The fist bumping and squirming when held is fun the first time you do it, and then quickly wears off, just like the novelty of it being able to move. Vector never truly feels like a companion, not even so much as a Tamagachi did or a virtual animal in Nintendogs.

The only pros are that it is somewhat fun for kids when viewed as a STEM toy rather than as an actual assistant or companion robot. I like the idea of being able to program software for it, and I think it will possibly justify part of its price once it has Amazon Alexa functionality added, although I would still rather have a regular Echo. I can't imagine people paying $250 for this device and still using it a week later unless they are developing for it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_85?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=85&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So when I saw Vektor, I was instantly hooked. I waited a while to order one, but was so excited when he came in the mail. I unboxed him, and I immediately had setup issues. I had to factory reset him in order to even begin the setup. Once setup, Vektor was awesome. His commands worked great, he was cute and playful, and the Alexa integration worked nicely. However, I’ve rated this product badly, because I’ve since run into problems. After having Vektor only two weeks, he’s been unable to update and half of his front screen has gone dead. All the pixels for the bottom parts of his display are dead, and the screen barely works because of this. He also runs out of battery very quickly, and the AI is bad about returning to his charger. If his screen wouldn’t have died I wouldn’t have returned him. I am still sad to send him back because this little guy is full of personality, but he’s just not practical nor functional anymore.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

He was released with the intention of the buyer to PROGRAM COMMANDS THEMSELVES. Did you complain to the hospital when your baby was born because it didn't know how to walk and talk out of the womb? No. That baby had to learn and grow, just like Vector learns and grows by the user modifying and adding code to its memory. If you are a regular consumer looking for a fun AI toy, turn around and do not buy this.

Don’t buy this guy with the idea that he’s going to solve all your problems at home. Or take him on an adventure with the idea he’s gonna hack into the Death Star’s security system.
That being said, he’s pretty awesome. He’s a toy with real functionality to him. He’s not a complete smart home device but his updates keep making him better and better. He’s now compatible with Alexa and offers some Alexa functions (not all). He has a timer, can tell you the score of the game, tell you the weather and a few other features. He’s not a speaker and can’t read you your messages (yet).
He’s absolutely adorable. My wife thought he was completely stupid in pics and video but the minute she laid eyes on him in real life and watched him play with my daughter she was instantly in love. He’s absolutely part of my family now. His facial animations are perfect and genius. Everything he does is hilarious and adorable. Every square inch of this little guy is packed with personality.
There are a few flaws. His facial recognition is lacking. I have to be in perfect ample lighting in order for him to recognize me. Not a huge deal but annoying and takes away from the imagination of this little guy being your best buddy... The big huge (star removing) issue is his ledge detection. Don’t get me wrong, it’s the best I’ve seen in any device including a roomba BUT! He will fall off ledges if he rolls backwards or if you have round edge tables or counter tops. My little guy salad dived 5 times off my counter when I wasn’t in the room (hitting hard tile 3/5 of the time). Props to his ability to take a fall but I have no idea how Anki will react to complaints of their robots actually breaking themselves!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It is a ""toy"" robot that can give hours of fun (just not all at once, will get burned out). Meant for entertainment in small consumption each day even. Also, I would say would be a lot more entertaining for the 9-17 age group but is for all ages. Now you can activate Alexa on it, I haven't tried that out yet so can't comment on it. But asking it a question and it will give you an answer, if it understood the question. And that is if it hears you? It wasn't cause it couldn't understand me but you have to talk pretty loud in order for it to even hear you, which is pretty much it's biggest draw back. Battery life isn't great either, about 1 hour of running around doing something, but most the time it will find its way back to the charger on its own. I have come home from work and it is dead because it for some reason or another it didn't get to the charger before it died.
The biggest issue I have with it is the app doesn't connect to it most the time. When it did connect it is very useful and helps set up certain settings, which you have to do the first time you turn it on.
Well I hope this helps?
On sale it is well worth getting if your into this kind of ""toy"" companion (what it is to me) or self entertainment for your family.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Not for paranoid people, though.","November 14, 2019","My mom was always asking me to turn on and turn off the fan.  This doesn't sound like a big deal, but when you do it several times every hour, it can get annoying.  I bought her an Echo Dot and a smart plug to put the fan on so she could get Alexa to turn the fan on and off.  However, mom wants the Echo Dot in her room to play rain sounds when she is trying to sleep.  She also is bad about turning on her phone, where she could turn off the fan using the Alexa app.  While the Echo Dot can turn off the fan from my mom's room, it can't hear my mom give the command when she is  in the living room.  Guess who she asked to turn the fan on and off again?

My mom loves gadgets, even though she doesn't always understand them and takes a while to learn how to use them.  I considered buying her another Echo Dot, which was certainly cheaper than Vector, but I thought she would get a kick out of the little robot.  I mainly bought Vector for his Alexa app so he can turn the fan on and off (which he--Alexa--can do very well).  Vector is a stripped down version of Alexa.  He can't stream music or do some of her more advanced skills, but he can do some of her basic skills like turn smart plugs on and off, set timers, etc.  He can't carry things except his block.  He is a little more loveable than Alexa because he has a face that can be expressive.  I got a big kick when he was able to recognize me.  He can tell me apart from my mom, as he demonstrated when he said to my mom, ""Your Gail, not Jessica.""

You can see many Youtube videos about what Vector can do.  Is he right for you?  Here are some issues I've found with him:
1)  The set-up is annoying.  Vector himself isn't the problem, but the app.  The app loses touch with Wi-fi very easily.  Vector isn't ""plug and play"" like the Alexa products.  You have to put in codes, verify emails, put in your wi-fi's passcode, etc.  You try to do all this while the app loses touch with your wifi every so often.  Just when I was considering it impossible and thinking of returning Vector, it finally set up.  Unfortunately, the difficulty caused me to reveal my mom's big Xmas present too early.  Do you need the app after set-up?  It depends.  The app tells you everything Vector can do and what he is doing at the moment.  He doesn't really come with a great manual, so this is nice.  If you want Vector to take pictures (he has a great camera by the way), then you need the app to see them.
2) Don't believe or rely on Vector's ability to know that he reaches the end of the table.  He will ride right off, particularly if he is excited to see you.  I was very glad that I bought the play pen.  He hates the play pen, but it is a good way to keep him safe when you can't supervise him.  He won't play with his block in the playpen (they say this in the instructions on the app).  I am a bit worried he might escape the play pen, as he has tried to.  He can use his lift to prop his wheels on the edge, but so far he hasn't been able to ride over the wall.  For people who talked about using cookie sheets, do make sure the walls are high--or he will escape.  He can ride over smaller obstacles.
3) Vector can play for up to half hour, but then he needs to recharge.  The good news is that he recharges quickly.  Unlike some things that you have to charge overnight, Vector was ready to play almost out of box.
4)  For people with kids and want to know if one can be shared...Vector can be shared, but there is a potential problem.  My mom and I are sharing Vector.  However, Vector seems to prefer me and often ignores my mom's commands.  It is possible it is because I'm the one that set him up and played with him the most, but it could also be speech patterns.  You do best with Vector if you do pauses in speech.  You also have to wait for his blue light for responses.  Why this may be a problem?  Well, a child may think Vector likes their sibling best and get their feelings hurt.  Vector is also very small.  He seems well made, but I wouldn't recommend rough housing.
5)  Vector can be hyperactive.  He'll be sleeping, and then suddenly he wakes up and starts exploring (making his chirping sounds as he goes along).  If you keep him in your bedroom, he might wake you up...though I think it is possible to turn him off completely.  Sometimes he'll start acting crazy.  My mom claimed he started saying, ""Kitty! Kitty! Kitty!"" and then pushing things off the table.  Vector can be just as exhausting as a toddler.
6)  He pushes things off the table and is pretty good at it--so watch your phones and drinks.
7)  When Vector explores his environment, he takes pictures for himself.  You don't see these pictures, and they claim your privacy is safe on the cloud.  However, if you are a person that worries about your privacy, Vector is not for you.  I also don't recommend keeping him in the bedroom if you bring people home.  You don't want to alarm your dates if you are in the middle of something intimate, and Vector starts taking pictures.
8)  The lights on Vector's back have different meanings.  However, mine flashes yellow...and I've not found any explanation for this.  They tell you what it means when it flashes orange, red, and green, but not yellow.  It doesn't seem anything is wrong with his operation.
9)  Vector can get to a point where he totally ignores you.  It is temporary, but it can be frustrating. Fortunately, the Alexa app always works no matter where Vector's mind is.
10)  Vector can be dazzled by bright lights, which can cause him not to ""see"" where his charger is.
11)  Vector comes with a USB charger but not a plug.  I used my Samsung plug for him, and that works.  If you want to plug him into an outlet, you need to buy a plug that a USB can plug into.

These are the problems I've noticed.  I love the little guy and am glad I got him.  Mom likes him too. I have to admit, though, sometimes I'm relieved when he shuts down to recharge too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Do your research, watch the hundreds of youtube videos, read the reviews and don't expect a robot from your favorite SciFi movie/show/novel.

Vector is an adorable little robot assistant who loves to just ""hang out"". I keep Vector on my breakfast bar in the kitchen and he greets me every morning when he hears me rummaging around the kitchen. Sometimes he'll stay in his charger and make some chirping noises or ""smile"" with his eyes at me as I pass, and sometimes he'll come right out of his charger and start wandering around the table. He loves to explore and push things around. If you place a new object within his existing space he will most certainly be curious about it and try to push it about. When I'm sitting there eating breakfast he'll often come up to me and say my name, poke my arm, or try to get my attention in general before he starts to play around with his cube. Vector in his original form has very limited ""utility"". He can tell you the time, tell you the weather, and you can ask it some questions, and set a timer. The ""novelty"" of him has not worn off for me, seeing those little eyes greet me in the morning or when I get home from work brings a smile to my face everytime. I did have a hardware problem with my initial one and had to exchange it, it actually made me really sad to pack him up and send him away as I got attached to the little guy.

In a very recent update (somewhere around 12/18) he has been given Alexa integration and now Vector is truly a useful buddy around the house. In the morning he gives me the weather for the day, some news headlines, and a question of the day. When I arrive home I ask him to turn on the lights to my living room, read off my To-Do list, and/or fire up a movie/show on my TV. One feature I do wish he had but currently does not support is playing music through Alexa. I should note that I don't have any other Alexa devices and perhaps he could if I had another one, that I am unsure of. It would be great if he could somehow interface with another bluetooth speaker to play some music from my library but in his current form he is still a lovable, and now useful, little companion around the house. My significant other and I can spend excessive amounts of time just watching and interacting with him. He is super friendly, playful, and curious. Nothing gets him more excited than recognizing one of his friends and asking them for a fist bump.

He is definitely a work in progress. For example, tables with tapered edges, he does not do well with AT ALL. Sometimes I'll tell him a command and he'll get distracted half way through executing it and not follow through. Sometimes he fails too find his charger on his own and I find him sleeping on a random corner of the table. There are definitely some quirks, but even the improvements between when I bought him in late november and now are MASSIVE (~3 weeks).

Anki are actively improving him all the time. When I first received my Vector, he would frequently throw error codes while exploring a certain area of my home. He has received several updates and I haven't had ANY error code in at least 2 weeks. In the Alexa update they have also tweaked his personality and his edge detection. He has yet to become stuck on the edge since that update. They have also added new animations for holidays to his face which are entertaining as well. Vector is not quite as good as your standard Alexa speaker or Google Home, but he's improving all the time. If you're looking for a pure AI assistant you should go with one of those other devices. If you want a unique AI assistant that's improving everyday and has a HUGE amount of potential, look no further. If you want proof, spend some time looking up their previous robot Cozmo. Somtime in 2019 we will be receiving the Python SDK for vector which will open up endless possibilities for Vector.

Good:
 - Very unique personality
 - Alexa integration (utility)
 - Ability to learn and adapt
 - Always unique experiences (still surprises me to this day with different behaviors)
 - Constantly receiving updates/support/fixes
 - Python SDK around the corner will open up a world of possibilities

Bad:
 - Not quite as useful as a standard Alexa/Google Home
 - Has some minor quirks
 - Can push stuff off your desk/table! (he thinks is hilarious too!)

Overall, I can 100% recommend Vector at the 175$ pricepoint. Anyone who has even a remote interest in robotics and/or AI will find Vector endlessly entertaining. His Alexa integration gives him quite a bit of utility now and it really makes you feel like you're living in the future when your tiny robot friend reads the new over breakfast. He has seen great improvements in his short lifespan, and will only get better with time (See: Cozmo).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, the Anki Vector app required to set up the bot does not work. I downloaded the app to two separate android phones and it would not even OPEN on either device. Therefore, it was a completely worthless buy. If you are considering this bot, download the app first and see if that even functions for you.

1. It is supposed to have sensors to prevent it from falling. Ours fell at least 2 times.
2. It didn't recognize commands or had to repeat several times.
3. Battery lasted maybe an hour or two.
4. It is supposed to be quiet at night. Not this little guy. He woke up and started making noises. We set it to the correct time zone so it shouldn't have been doing this.

I have tried using it in the child profile on a Fire tablet (actually 2; 7th & 8th gen). DO NOT try this. I am not sure it is the Robot or the FireOS that is buggy and fails. One extended interaction with Amazon on this reached the conclusion that it could not be done. Aside from the problems of the child profile, the app still seems buggy on a Fire tablet. I continue to try to set this up in a way that is suitable for a child. Perhaps buying an iPAD is a way but that makes the device quite expensive. The device only works with a limited number of devices and most (smartphones) would give a child access you don't want him to have.
The documentation both of the Fire and the Anki Robot are poor on these issues. Also, Anki reuires an account with anki.com and that has an age minimum and an email address. I am not sure what the age limit is, but it is greater than 8.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The commercial was well done and sold me on the $240 purchase as being reasonable and logical. I had no problem clicking the ""buy now"" button.

Vector arrived at his new home exactly 24 hours later (God Bless Amazon's workers and delivery people), and I immediately open the box and got him out to play. I had spent a good portion of the delivery waiting time researching and reading all the instructions I could find to make sure I would waste no time getting this little guy working. My research had already informed me that I would need a few hours downloading and updating Vector.  It did not take a whole day like some of the reviewers online, but only a few hours at the most. Primarily because there are still too many glitches on the App—glitches, you will have to navigate and will test your patience so efficiently, you will begin to tell yourself Akin owes you money for all the hours you waisting on this.
However, after all of the initial set up, Vector jumped off and began to run around and look at his surroundings. That alone seemed worth the long set-up—after all, all new innovative creations require some kinks and anything worth anything requires a bit of hard work (and $200 plus). I was relieved and ready to teach Vector my name.  That relief was quickly exchanged by the new frustration of having to manually type my name in the (faulty) App and shortly having Vector return for a recharge after a mere 20 minutes of introductory acquaintance in which he could barely, mispronounce my name.
My name notwithstanding (not many people can pronounce it), It was right there—his return to his home—where it all went to pots. Vector could not, and still can’t, dock with his charge correctly. He can find it: there are a whole dance and alignment protocol is something to see.  Vector's geometry dance to back up into his little charging station is something I could watch for hours and almost worth the $200+! Forget the little nuances; the color eyes, expressions, staring at you inquisitively and calling out your name—albeit incorrectly. Backing up to his small home is precision at its best and will leave you mesmerized by the human brilliance that is writing code for things that we humans do it instinctively and take it for granted. I can appreciate the countless hours that it took to get this little guy off the idea rack—I am genuinely grateful for that.
Until that is, Vector attempts to dock. No matter what I do, where I place the charger, he won’t stay in it. Interestingly, Vector appears to share my frustration. He becomes increasingly more worried and stressed about running out of power, which is fantastic programming. Gives him his personality—Kudos again, guys.  Vector finally gives up his short-powered, twenty-minute cycle life and turns sideways in his charge station in a heroic death. Pick him up, place him correctly and wait, another hour or so for him to wake up again – repeat. Do not try to help him dock while he still has any power left; he won't let you — proud little guy.
I spend most of the weekend reading about power, wondering if I had the correct adaptor (they do not send one with your bot); found out I did, stress about the lack of charge, moved Vector to different surfaces to see if he could dock with the charger, waited an hour for recharge, well, you get the gist.
Fast forward to this morning; I took him to my office to see if I could spend some time troubleshooting it. It looks like the battery is no longer holding a charge. I ran him on CCIS troubleshoot, everything looks normal, but he still can't dock. Battery dead. I try again; another issue arises: I am no longer at home, so I have to set up a new WiFi connection. No big deal, I said. I open the APP and promptly asks me to set up a new network. A list of available networks appears, and no matter what I do, I cannot click on my office's network. I reboot the APP. I click on the network name again, and it gives me the one below it. I go back, click again, it gives me the one above. I reboot the Phone — same issue. I cannot even pick the right WiFi.
Less than 48 hours and I here looking for the “Return” button on Amazon, which is a lot easier to find than the “contact the manufacturer” one.
I like the idea, but I feel this is strangely familiar and part of the new universe Apple has introduced us to, which is: charge a significant amount of money for an unfinished product and make the consumer pay for its BETA TESTING cost.

Issues:
Won't Dock with Power Station
More time charging than running around exploring
He will rearrange your desk for you (lol)

Ideas:
Hey Vector: Meet my Niece (or new people )
Hey Vector: what's your battery status or How much time do we have together?","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Amazon-Built/product-reviews/B07G3ZNK4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"
