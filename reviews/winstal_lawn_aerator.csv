The sandals took a little wile to put together, maybe 10-15 minutes and are relatively self-explanatory.  I did have some difficulty understanding which side to face the buckle and I'm still working those kinks out.

The most difficult part is keeping the sandal on your foot while walking.  I wasn't able to lift my foot up without the sandal falling off.  I'm going to try it again and tighten the straps as much as I possibly can.  I read that wearing boots keeps the sandals on better. Here in Central Texas it gets too hot to mow the yard in boots!

Hopefully I can find a way to make these work for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Aeration of lawns is recommended for a healthier grass.  The shoes are simple to put on, These shoes are solid with 3 straps so that they stay on while you walk.  They State that these  are a one size fits all but look like they will not fit anyone over  a size 11.5 as these are 11.8 inches long.  The best way to use these is to wear them while mowing the lawn.  The spikes are solid and sturdy and the package includes 5 extra spikes and a small wrench of attaching them.

The spikes aren’t hard to put together. They’re glorified nails in my view. The plastic foot holders were fairly rigid, so I figured they’d be sturdy enough to stand on. The straps buckled these in fairly well.

It had been raining recently, so the ground is nice and soft. Even Georgia clay, hard as it is, yields to rain after a while.

I have used an aerator before- the real, heavy kind. That one really pulls out the yard plugs.

This I imagine would qualify for a distinct “next best thing.”

Now, on to the test itself. How ridiculous did I look? Plenty. You may want to try this in the dark. You really kind of look ridiculous. I was warned by plenty of friends that their experiences with this type of product were largely laugh riots.

But the overall task took me about 45 minutes.

And really, since the stakes go about 7 inches deep, I think that’s a pretty good deal for the money. You get exercise and the knowledge that you saved yourself a few bucks on a real aerator and that you just did something really nice for your lawn.","3.0 out of 5 stars","",""

The main problem was walking up hill. The back off my boot jumped over the back of the back rest multiple times. I had to really tighten the straps multiple times.  Over they worked as expected.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wistar-Aerator-Shoes-Buckles-Straps/product-reviews/B07H31J389/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I would rather just hire the job done but my cable company only buried the cable feed 1 inch deep (I have tried repeatedly to get the cable company out to bury the cable correctly, no success as I'm sure any of you that had to deal with a cable company can well Imagine)  and I know whoever I hired to do the job would end up running over the cable and punching many holes in.  At least I though with these I can do it myself and keep away from the cable as well as the irrigation sprinklers heads.  They do work when I can keep them on, A big problem though .  My foot keeps coming out, the straps won't stay tight adding to the problem.  I have a fix in mind to try,  bolt an old pair of shoes permanently to the aerator shoes hoping that will solve the issue (Will update if successful).  I'm sure the neighbors do get plenty of laughs watching me try to use them.","2.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Although I have not actually used them in my yard yet because the lawn is still very soggy from the tremendous amount of snow that we received this winter, I am certain that these spikes will do the job, and it sure beats the price vs. what a lawn service charged me last year.  I also like that these included extra spikes, screws, washers and nuts to replace any that may loosen up during use and can not be found.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""
