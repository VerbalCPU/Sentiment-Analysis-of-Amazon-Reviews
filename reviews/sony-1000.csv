The noise cancelling is truly incredible. I am currently using this with my gaming computer and it is absolutely fantastic. Paired with my fantastic sound card, my volume hovers at around 20% and it's loud enough with the noise cancelling to block even my own voice.

The reason I didn't give this 5 stars is even though its build quality is exceptional, the sound quality is exceptional, and the battery is rated for a whopping 30 hours which is very good, I simply cannot excuse Sony's use of a puny little usb c cable. The cable is probably 6 inches long, including the usb c connector and regular usb connector! You are also not given an ac adapter! In order to get this thing charging, I had to get under my desk and hook it up to one of the usb ports in the back of my computer. After three hours, I had to go under my desk again to extract the headphones.

A few months ago I had bought another pair of Sony Bluetooth headphones for working out and they came with a 2 foot cable. I thought that was bad but it seems Sony wanted to amp up their cable shortening game. (if you're wondering why I can't use that cable because it's micro usb and these headphones use usb c) Honestly, you can't beat Sony's engineering but their bean counters or whoever authorized the use of these ridiculously short cables ruined the experience to some extent. Be prepared to get uncomfortable to charge these or fork up the extra money for a useable usb c cable. If you have an extra ac adapter lying around, you will need to use the box these headphones came in as a layer between the headphones and the ground because again, the puny 6 inch cable isn't long enough for you to rest them on a table. I couldn't even place these these on top of my tower computer because the cable wasn't long enough to reach the usb connectors. I truly do find it unacceptable I paid so much money and Sony supplied me with their shortest cable yet!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Noise cancellation is uncannily effective and the sound quality is great although I found myself fiddling with the equalizer to boost the mid-range to fit my taste.

It's not touted as a top-line feature, but the headphones are Google Assistant compatible which allows them to do special tricks like read my notifications on my late-model Android phone. If that floats your boat it's another little nice-to-have that you might not have realized looking at the product listing.

My only complaint is the touch controls for playback. I have to double-tap the right ear-cup to pause/play. Not only is it really loud (because you are essentially playing a drum on your own ear) but the double-tap doesn't always register and I find myself doing it multiple times!

No cause I can detect.  Neither wired nor wireless matters.  Did the reset settings and factory reset routines...nadda.  Dead.

First.  I bought them because the sound and noise cancellation were AMAZING.  I was transfixed and amazed by the demo set.  Better than the Bose, Beats, Skull Candy...and whatever that other brand was on the display.

BUT the cons quickly won.
The onboard mic is crap.  ""You sound like you are in a tunnel"".
They are plastic and feel delicate.
The ""velvet covering"" on the cups is the kind of stuff that turns to sticky goo in a few years.
The ""fake leather"" covering seems the/is the same on my last set of Sonys that finally flaked off (took a few years - to be fair).
The volume, forward/reverse controls were tedious.  The ""cover to pause"" worked well.

AND expensive.

Glad the crappy part came through so quickly...can take back IMMEDIATELY.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_196?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=196&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They were extremely comfortable and the noise canceling worked well. The thing is the Bose QC35 II sounds very  good but not great. Its flat signature is good everything but great at nothing. It’s like they don’t want to offend anyone.

These Sony’s were released a week after I had the Bose and based on professional reviews it appeared Sony hit a home run. I still wasn’t convinced so I went to my local Big Box store and tried them. WOW! I returned the Bose and never looked back. These headphones do everything the Bose does except a little better. And I mean everything (sound, NC, codecs, features, battery life, app) Comfort is equal with the Sony redesign.
The only + for the Bose is it connects to multiple devices at once. That’s not something I care about but I thought it was fair to mention since that may be a deal breaker for some people.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Pros:
Sound quality is amazing, I don't think I've ever heard a pair of headphones sound this good. The bass is pronounced but not overbearing and the mids and highs are crisp and clear. It's also worth noting that the equalizer on the app is fully customizable and unlike many other headphones, you can actually notice the difference when making any changes in the EQ settings.

The Noise cancellation was great too, I don't think I was blown away as much as many reviewers on youtube have expressed but these headphones did a great job of reducing a lot of ambient noise. Just don't expect them to block out people's voices.

The look and feel of these headphones is top notch. They have a certain minimalistic look to them that screams quality, and the touchpad controls were really convenient to use.

They are extremely comfortable to wear (minus the sweaty ears after extended amount of use). And they don't feel too heavy on your head.

The battery life on these is also amazing! and USB-C definitely takes that to the next level with the quick charge feature.

Now for the cons....

Quality Control; like many other users have expressed, my headphones had a strange scratching or popping noise in the right ear cup when Noise Cancellation was tuned on. This noise would stop and go away randomly and it was really noticeable and irritating when playing music at low volumes. Now I know what you're thinking? Maybe I had a bad pair and I should exchange them for another? ... I gave Sony the benefit of the doubt and I exchanged these headphones, 2 TIMES! All three pairs had the same popping noise issue. One of them had the issue on both ear cups. For $350 headphones, this isn't something I was willing to deal with.

Multi-pairing; One other major issue I have with these headphones is the lack of a multi pairing feature. You can really only pair with one device at a time while using these and if you want to switch to another device, then you have to unpair from the previous device before you're able to pair with the new device. This seems like a minor issue to deal with but if you use multiple devices, say an iPad, computer and phone to listen to any type of media throughout the day, this can quickly become an inconvenience. This is especially true if you're already used to the quick pairing features of any Beats headphones, or multi pairing features of Bose Headphones.

All in all if you're ok with having to play the lottery with quality control when ordering these headphones or if you're not worried about having to pair multiple devices while listening, then these headphones might be the ones for you.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Sony Headphone app also lets you play around with different settings, allowing you to fine tune your music preferences.

Really, after using these headphones it is really difficult to go again to regular earphones. You simply feel the beat in a way that is difficult to explain. Even with maximum sound, I haven't felt pain in my ears. I can easily use the headphones the whole day. Also, the battery is so good. It can really last the whole day or even more. I literally listen the whole time so these batteries are serious things.
It is true that switching between devices is not as easy as it should be. Nevertheless, the product is so good that in the end, you get used to.

Parker III","What Pro Reviewers fail to mention...","November 14, 2018","I bought these headphones because I had some extra cash, I am a tech-aholic, and I wanted to offload my barely one year old Sony WH1000XM2 to my father who asked me for some headphones. I may end up giving him the news model because it is most definitely not worth the upgrade price. The ads will dazzle you with fancy terms like Liquid Crystal Polymer drivers or fast charging, the reality, in simple terms, is that these headphones are marginally better sounding than the previous model. What makes these headphones different aside from all the fancy new tech built into them is this, they are designed for people with bigger ears and bigger heads. The padding which was ample on the older model was thicker. The new driver technology in the headphones sounds marginally better which amounts to basically nothing since the older model sounds exceptionally good. You'll hardly notice the better sound since the key feature in the noise cancelling headphones is worse in the new model, that being the noise cancellation. That thick cushion layer in the old model helped with the noise cancelation, any pro-reviewer that tells you the noise cancellation is better with the new model is a shill and I will stand by that statement. I use my headphone primarily at the gym (I am in the military) and the difference is quite clear. When wearing the older model, I barely head the grunts, chatter, or equipment from the other people using the facility even when I am not playing music. I have to turn the music up on the newer models to block out most of the ambient sounds since the thinner cushioning does not block out anywhere near that level of noise. Noise cancellation on any headphone that lays claim to that term is a combination of lots of things including the technology. The tech only goes so far. Yes it is excellent software based sound cancelling but without the extra cushioning it is wasted. Does the new model sound better, just a little. Not the current over $300 price they are charging better. Are they more comfy, to me no. But if your ears and head are bigger than mine, probably a great deal. It is most certainly not worth the price they are asking for if you own (and are happy with) the older model, definitely not worth the upgrade. Wait for some truly incredible headphone breakthrough before you upgrade, buy the older model which is the sam price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_196?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=196&reviewerType=all_reviews"

These headphones sound great though, and for most listeners will have sufficient sound quality. I haven't tested the battery life yet, but the features are great and they are fairly comfortable.

I'd recommend buying a longer USB-C cord though, unless you only ever plan to connect them to your computer. The cord is only a few inches long so it won't work if you want to use a wall charging block.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Anyway, I am a kind of early adaptor in terms of the Noise Cancelling headset. About 2.2 years ago, I purchase Bose QC35. At that time, the noise cancelling headset was wonderful. And, I still use this product. However, today, I met Sony WH1000XM3. I just recognize that I need to convert from BOSE to SONY. First of all, as the description say, you can easily master all functions within 1mins. It means that this Sony headset is very naturally well-designed. Second, the ear-cover is very comfortable. As you know, one of the issues the user of the previous version of Sony (WH1000XM2) was the uncomfortable ear-cover: So, my brother usually complaints. By comparing with Bose QC35 (first version), this new product is really great! Third, this device has Bluetooth 4.1 function. It means that you can connect two devices at once (in my case, smartphone and laptop). Fourth, there are three modes, such as noise cancelling, ambient sound, and normal. If you select ambient sound, you can more clearly listen others' speak and background sounds than normal mode even though you wear this headset. Fifth, the noise cancelling function is not different from Bose. But, the feeling is more comfortable (In Bose QC35, when you turn on the noise cancelling function, you may feel very subtle strange: that does not happen in this device). Lastly, the most important thing is sound. Yes, this is Sony. The sound quality is really wonderful!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Having previously only ever used Beats this was a huge upgrade for me. When I finally got the headphones I was astounded at the sound quality and how well it canceled noise, however it only toke me all of 3 minutes to figure out that there was a pretty major flaw with these headphones. After taking the headphones through a hertz test, I discovered that at around 80 hertz the bass in the right speaker was significantly weaker than the left, and stayed this way until the frequency got so low it didn't even respond. And when I say significant, I mean you can't even tell its responding unless you remove the left cup from your ear entirely

Pretty disappointing. So I got in touch with costumer I told them my problem and after jumping through a few hoops they offered to send me a replacement pair.

So two week pass and I finally get my replacement headphones and low and behold, it has the same problem. Granted not the exact same since the drop off point moved from 80 hertz to 60 hertz. Since this wasn't quite as bad, and I didn't feel like waiting to weeks, I decided to keep these and try to ride it out. It's now September and the Headphones have gotten much worse.

Now starting from 200 hertz and going down until the headphones no longer respond there is a huge difference in bass. At 130ish hertz you might as well take the right cup off because of how little it responds. Not buying Sony headphones for awhile now unfortunately.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_52?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=52&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I did a lot of research on ANC headphones and eventually landed on this one. My previous ANC headphone was a taotronics over the ear model. I thought the ANC was decent on that one,  1000MX3 is significantly better and has a few more options. I like that it has an app that you can tweak the sound profile. In the office, I can blockout everything while keeping the music volume really low. One cool feature is if you're using the 3.5mm jack, if you unplug it the ANC automatically shuts off.

There is always a debate between the Bose QC35II and the 1000MX3. Here are my reasons I picked the 1000MX3
- LDAC codec
- USB-C charging
- A bit more bass heavy in the sound
- Hand over right cup lets in ambient sounds
- Ability to toggle: No ambient sound just music, ambient with music(This is what Bose mostly sounds like) and no ANC.

There are 2 cons I must mention: my ears get a little warm using this for a bit and the 3.5mm port on the headphone is really small so you just can't just plug in one that's laying around. Paying this much for a headphone, I'd like to use any AUX cord I have laying around. Minor annoyances but overall a great product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm pleased with the product, but it isn't as polished of an experience as the Bose QuietComfort 35. After testing the two side-by-side, I felt the Sony headphones had a head up in most areas. Sound quality, fit and finish, ergonomics/fit on my head, and the noise cancelling all seemed better to me. The way it looks and USB-C were bonuses.

But the product begins to look less appealing after long term use. People have been talking about the mics amplifying ambient noise in phone calls, but that is not a problem for me since I don't primarily use it as a headset. It is still an issue, but not much of one for me considering where I make my calls and how often I make them. More annoying are multiple software oversights. First, the sound quality settings aren't intuitive. Why can't I use the in-app equalizer when using the ""prioritize sound quality"" connection mode? There is also no way to modify settings without using the app, such as the sound quality or function of the nc/assistant button. My experience with the connection in high sound quality mode is mixed. Every device I tried to have the problem: sometimes it stutters, sometimes it doesn't, seemingly at random. These devices support LDAC and the other audio formats, but none of them seem to connect properly with these settings.

I am glad I chose these over the Bose, since I consider those all small grievances. It's a fantastic product, but not for everyone. If you are willing to sacrifice convenience for the best of the best, get these. For anyone who wants to pair their headphones and have them work well every time, get Bose headphones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Davis","Sony WH1000XM3 - Great N.C.H.","May 23, 2019","After doing a fair amount of research between the two-industry leading N.C.H...  (Bose and Sony); I went with the Sony WH1000XM3. The tipping point, the hand over the right ear mute feature. It may seem simple, but I cannot begin to tell you how convenient this feature is. On my last airline trip, I found myself using this feature time and time again. From brief conversations to listening to announcement, all without removing my headphones. For sound quality, long-wearing comfort, & noise canceling, the WH1000XM3 is top notch.  As for some of the comments, I've read surrounding the difficulties, & inconvenience with pairing up with numerous devices, I've found it not accurate.  I have my WH1000XM3 paired with two different laptops manufacture with different OS, two different types of cell phones, and a plethora of Samsung devices. The only knock I have with the WH1000XM3 is…, I think the qc35 ii has a better outward presentation, (aesthetics) and that's all.  Technology, sound quality, comfort and features, WH1000XM3 hands down. The price points are about the same so, that’s not really a factored. I hope you find the hope somewhat helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They're extremely comfortable as they fit over the ear. I can wear them for hours and hours without any ear pain/discomfort like I get from on-ear headphones. My only complaint is that the noise cancelling isn't as great as I would like. I also have Bose In-ear noise cancelling headphone and the noise cancelling on those are extremely hard to beat. But these Sony ones are wireless Bluetooth which is why I bought them. For what they are they are great.  A big plus is they actually can go much further from the Bluetooth source of what they are connected to than what is stated by Sony which is great. I've been able to walk almost 50 feet or so away from my computer and still stay connected and hear my music, even through some walls.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_64?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=64&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have zero issues with sound quality.

However, the build quality is extremely concerning. They're built out a plastic that feels very brittle and cheap, and I have concerns about their long term durability. Reading other reviews has only bolstered these fears. It seems that Sony is uninterested in warranting their product. For the price, there's no reason Sony couldn't use a metal + pleather band and hinge mechanism.

I also haven't been able to get them to pair with either of two Linux computers.

If they were $200, I'd have given them 4 stars with reservations.

That means people like to come here and make noise partying or playing with their toys. (My job is to keep the noise down and try to keep people safe.) My wife was very annoyed by the noise so we tried this before moving on. All the outside reviews say Sony jumped past Bose with this new model so we tried it. It seems to cancel all the extraneous noise for her and she loves it. She uses it for audio books as well as music. She has used it on flights and in airports. We're in the Arizona desert in the summer (!?!) and it cancels out the RV air conditioning noise for her along with the erratic guest noise. In all situations she says she has perfect silence behind her selected source. However, in spite of how much she loves it, I'm hoping that I don't become an extraneous noise! (As a partner you will also be cancelled out so I go over to her and touch her to gain her attention ... and take each interruption to share a hug and kiss.

App controls the level of the sound and it gets annoying but you can always tinker with it to keep a steady level. The noise canceling blocks out everything that isn’t directly close to you and also comes with an ambient sound control to hear everything without taking the headphones off. The only reason to take these off is because I get sweaty and minor sores around the ear from time to time.

The Bluetooth issue was too hard to ignore for such a high tier headphone. Other issues I had but didn't put below were the sides of the earpieces stick out a little too far on your head. So either side of your head looks a bit like a 1950's robot. They're not as aesthetically pleasing as I would like.

The material and sound quality are amazing. The Battery life is outstanding but I can only give this product 3 stars because I expect a $350 pair of Bluetooth headphones to be able to intelligently connect to multiple devices. I am always hopping between my laptop, iPad and iPhone. Each time I go to a different device I have to manually disconnect the Bluetooth from that devices and them manually reconnect the Bluetooth to the new device. EVERY TIME. I can’t believe such a top of the line pair of headphones would have such horrible intellegent Bluetooth handling. I would hope that the headphones would know which device I would need to hear from the audio coming from said device. I’m very close to returning these and trying out the Bose. I’ve read the Bluetooth connection on the Bose are more intuitive.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Connects to only one device at a time (not worth the 300/350 price tag)
NFC is present, but no use except pairing to device initially and switching on ur device using NFC (which I consider extra work than using the power button).

I live in NYC commute daily like a rat on busy, crowded subways while jamming to Audible or some good deep house music before I sit at my desk at the hedge fund and get busy for 12 hours. These headphones changed my life. My commute has been better, I feel less agitated, happier. I don't have to listen to people talking, yawning, subway cars making noise. I am completely in my own world. Sound is great, I am playing around with the  Equalizer a little, Noise cancelling is good but it doesn't cancel out human voice fully if you dont have music on and someone speak to you, you will be able to hear it if its loud enough. The headphone do a great job at cancelling out all other noise like HVAC, Vacuum, Traffic, subway, plane hum, my dog running etc. Im very satisfied so far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

  For me $350 is a pretty big investment but figured I’d give it a shot and I’m so glad I did WHAT A DIFFERENCE the noise canceling is absolutely second to none and with the app and the EQ you can really dial these things in to your own taste and personal experience
  Build quality seems sturdy (no creaks or cracks when bending) and I gotta give em a 10/10 for comfort

Go get a pair of sennheisers and an amp.
I am a student at the University of Central Florida, so I will be writing this for my university homies, hopefully this helps, and note my inexperience with every set in this class. I have only use the QC 35's and surface headphones briefly.
So basically, we've got 5 important things for these headphones, as compared to something like the Bose QC 35 series II, which are the other leading headphones in this segment and price range. Sound, comfort, quality and reliablity, features, battery life, and value. I use these almost all day with my OnePlus 6t and have no issues at all, and when I get home I plug the aux into my gaming PC and it works amazingly for gaming, music, and noise cancelling all around. Now, for the specifics:

Sound - 10/10 - The sound is great, very punchy bass as one would expect, while still keeping clarity in the mids and highs. Honestly its a pair of headphones the average person would absolutely love.  I wont even put the likes of beats or anything in here because they don't compare. I know some have complained about the sound quality not being as balanced as the Bose QC 35 series II, but I also want to counter that by saying that the Sony app has an equalizer built in that really helps balance out the sound. When I hook them up to my computer, the EQ on my soundcard allows me to make them sound natural, and does not make the sound feel very fake, as it happens when you mess with the natural sound of headphones. Honestly just a great sound and fantastic listening experience.

Comfort - 8/10 - There isn't much to say here, the Bose QC 35 series II would be an easy 10/10 here. Those feel like you are wearing pillows. As a Florida man, it gets pretty hot here, and my ears do sweat when wearing the XM3's. Apart from the sweating (which never happens to me if I'm not outside in the heat), they are super comfortable. And they even keep your ears warm when it's colder outside, they're like earmuffs.

Quality and reliability - 7/10, ?/10 - This was a tough one, since I have not had them for very long. Its been about 3 weeks now and they are already creaking and making sounds when I move them around, though they do feel very nice to touch and though they are made of primarily plastic, the quality of the headphones is pretty good. I can't give a reliability score because I am not sure whether these will have the headband snapping issue that the previous versions have had, but the creaking is not a good sign. If you're going to buy these, buy the protection plan.

Features - 10/10 - Great features! I can't say enough good about the features for these headphones. Noise cancellation is the best in the segment, works without even having to be connected to bluetooth. The Sony app gives you TWENTY ONE LEVELS of noise cancellation. It's absolutely insane, and it works so incredibly well. I honestly can't hear a thing with the noise canceling on and music at about 30%. If i'm too lazy to take them off in class, I just turn the noise cancelling down to 16 (open mics) and can hear my professors very well. The touch pad controls are weird at first, but I have gotten used to them and they work consistently. Putting my hand over the earcup comes in handy when ordering food or thanking my shuttle driver, since it instantly turns off the noise cancellation and opens the mics so you can hear. Best features in the segment, amazing for use at university, and easy to use and control. The case for these is also great, and is very good at keeping the headphones safe and tucked away.

Battery life - 10/10 - Can't argue with the battery life on these. 10 minues and you get 5 hours of playback time with noise cancellation on and they will even charge to full in around 3 hours, which is absolutely mad. (Tested with a wall plug and charger, not on a laptop/PC). USB type C, which some care about, I do. Best battery in the segment, and I really have no complaints.

Value - 7/10 - Being the best headphones in this segment isn't easy. I can't give this a higher score because of reliability issues that have happened in the past, along with the creaking I am currently experiencing, but if it wasn't for reliability issues this would be an easy 9/10. The fact that one would also feel inclined to buy the 3 or 4 year warranty because of these reliability questions also knocks off a point. But these are definitely best in class, and even better if you can catch them on sale.

Tl;dr, great headphones. Would recommend them if you're a university student who travels on shuttle or bus, or if you just like to isolate yourself and listen to music, podcasts, or videos in crowded or noisy places. They charge fast, sound great, are comfortable enough, and have best in class features. If comfort and pure sound are your two priorities and you don't care about extreme noise cancellation, usb C charging, don't want to spend ~$15 on a 4 year warranty, and don't care at all about modern features, get the Bose QC 35.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I used to be a Beats guy but with the outstanding disappointment I decided to buy a pair of the Sony WHx1000m2 and literally two weeks after I bought them Sony released the xm3's so I sent back the m2's and after some wait got these bad puppies. Over all sound is amazing and then bass in these headphones makes quite a statement for itself. However I have one problem with them. When noise cancelation is one and you are either walking or chewing something and listening to a song, the movement of the ear cups on your headphone interfere with the noise cancellation and you kind of get this kick back that doesn't sound very good. I have only noticed with while moving and eating with them on. When you are completely still this doesn't happen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I mean, noise cancelling headphones are big with business travelers, and you do A LOT of calls in business, so until they fix this, they need to stop producing these and Amazon should stop selling them.  And even if these are strictly for pleasure, 90% of the time you use them, they are connected TO YOUR PHONE and your phone GETS CALLS.  So I don't get when people give it 3 stars for sound.  It would be like giving 3 stars for a car that is comfortable and drives great but all the electronics in the cabin fail every time.  That is called a product fail. No points for “great sound” when they can’t even handle a simple phone call. Sony needs to do a recall.

Has great noice cancellation, great sound but it has a major flaw. Unlike the Bose QC35, this headphone does not support active pairing with multiple devices.

Let me explain with an example. Let's say you are sitting at your desk at work, watching a video on your laptop, sound coming out on your headphones. You get a call on your phone.

What happens with Bose QC35: You answer the call on your phone, QC35 automatically recognizes that it's a call and automatically switches the connection so it's between your headphones and your phone and you start talking through the headphones. When you hang up the call, the headphone switches back to your laptop to resume watching the video.

What happens with Sony XM3: You answer the call on your phone, you disconnect your XM3 from the laptop's bluetooth menu, you wait for XM3 to pick up the new connection to the phone, and then choose XM3 from your phone's output menu to use the headphones for conversation. When you are done with your call, you go to your phone's bluetooth menu to disconnect it and then reestablish a connection with your laptop and the XM3 through your laptop's bluetooth menu.

To summarize, this is a perfect device for those who use it only with their phone but if you have more than one device such as a laptop, tablet and a phone, the user experience is pretty terrible.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Tiny bit of background: I'm a full time student (grad school)... with a full time job (open office plan)... and I have two young (3&5), active, loud children.  As a result, I often have a hard time focusing on my work and studies when I need to actually concentrate. Did I mention I get distracted easily? Like right now I should be working... anyways.

So for the last few months I've been using two devices at once. I wear noise cancelling earbuds (active 65Ts-which I love), inside of noise cancelling over the ears(QC25s- which I also love).  The problem though was that for extended periods the solution just wasn't comfortable.  You get the inside the ear itch coupled with the head squeeze, but compared to the noise, the annoyance was worth it.

So last week I picked up these guys, and oh man are they game changers.  I ran some semi-qualitative tests and saw a significant improvement over the earbuds and a solid improvement over the over-the-ears in pure noise rejection.  Now all and in all they don't eliminate as much as the double solution, but it's close and so much more comfortable.

Things I like so far:
*Noise Cancellation- even without music playing they make background noise manageable.  The ANC is much better than anything else in my stable and I was able to go down to a single set for the back half of the week.
*Sound- music clarity is just simply amazing. The equalizer options are easy to use and cycle through.
*Comfort- Very light and very comfortable. I don't have a set of 35IIs, but I can say they are much more comfortable than the fleet of headphones I have in my house. My only other ones that are close are a set of RF175s on my home audio setup that I bent into perfect submission.
*Battery life- the 30 hour stated life is no joke, and USB-C much needed and appreciated.
*Pass-Through audio- This needs to be on everything with noise cancellation. The right ear hand cup to be able to hear is great. Being able to turn it on all the time is useful too.
*Right ear track and volume controls- this has grown on me quickly. I love how its implemented with the gestures and not needing hard pushes or long pushes.  On ear buds that sit in your ear this is not fun at all.

The OKs:
*Call quality- the bass seems a bit amped up but that could be my settings, the people I've had calls with say I sound fine.
*Aesthetics- ehh, not exactly my style.  The copper accents are nice I guess, but like I said, not my style.

The nitpicking:
*NC/Ambient Button- would really like the option to setup sound pass-through to pause music(like the 65ts).  I don't much like the delay either with the lady in my ear telling me what state the phone is in between pushed. I can hear what state its in just fine- just change quickly and be done with it.
*The app- I know its new, I think i'm just spoiled with others as far as usefulness and working through the app. I also like how with 65ts you can stream any number of white and pink noises though it and shift around the order on the UI.
*Cost- its high, but you get what you pay for.  I don't regret the purchase at all, and suspect it will be a long time before these get discounted... they are simply that good.

So yeah, to sum it up... so far I love these things and look forward to many enjoyable years with them as my daily drivers.  They are comfortable, have great sound, noise cancellation, battery life, and are just good for pretty much everything but exercising.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_119?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=119&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The noise cancellation cannot seize to amaze me. Very useful in places like buses where you can just zone out. Noise cancellation works particularly well with low frequency sounds, which make air conditioning, ventilation, bus/car engine sounds almost unnoticeable. Be careful with these outside. I usually do not use them while I walk outside of campus.

Sound Quality: it is pretty good. The high frequencies could have been a little bit sharper, but it is not a very significant issue.  The bass is boosted to normal commercial level which is enjoyable, but not so good for music makers. Also, the mic is good, but sometimes it is hard for people to hear me well when I call through them.

Design and convenience: very well made headphones with a neat case. The hand interface is amazing. I did not buy them for that, but I was very pleased to find out about the feature.

I got my pair on sale with a military discount on the military exchange site for $300.

In the box, you get the carrying case, a short USB-C charging cable, gold-plated L-shaped stereo mini plug (3.5mm), and a plug adaptor for in-flight use. Both the 3.5mm headphone jack and charging cable have Sony branding.

The battery life is amazing. The M3s feature 30 hours of playback with a full charge. The USB-C input allows for quick charging. Charging them for 10 minutes gives you 5 hours of playback which is almost insane. After charging these for about 25minutes I’m consistently at almost a full charge. This is a major plus for me since I have my headphones on for almost all hours of the day and I typically sleep with them still on my head.

I do still have several complaints about the M3s. Some of my complaints are just me being nit-picky, others are truly annoying. First, the adaptive sound control mutes whatever is playing and makes a chime when it recognizes a change in your actions (ex. going from walking to running). I find it annoying to have my music paused for this feature. Second, I haven’t been able to get the touch controls to respond while wired. It’s a hassle to have to pull out my phone just to pause or change a track. The only touch feature I’ve found that works while wired is the quick attention (placing your palm over the right ear cup minimize volume and amplify the sound of your surroundings). This also only works when the headphones are turned on, of course. Thirdly, forcing the headphone priority to be on stable connection when utilizing the equalizer or sound position control. I personally prefer the priority to always be on sound quality. Last, one of the touch controls will activate when laying my head on my right shoulder. This is frustrating when flying or laying down when talking on the phone. If I lay my head to the left, I cover the microphones and the person can’t hear me over the phone.

Sound Quality:
Needless to say, the sound quality is phenomenal. I have never really understood how anyone could say the Bose QC35 IIs sound better than the Sony’s. The Bose just sound flat with a terrible soundstage.

I do not hear that much of a difference in quality when listening wirelessly vs. wired. I prefer listening wirelessly. I will admit that I was disappointed with the sound right out of the box. The M3s sounded very very similar to my h.ear on wireless 100ABNs. I mean almost identical. When I first starting using the 100ABNs, it took several days to “break them in”. The more I listened to them, the better they sounded. I’ve had the same experience with the M3s. This time after several hours of listening they sounded much better. This could simply be that my ears needed time to become attuned to them. In comparison with the 100ABNs, the M3s have much better clarity in both the highs and mids. The M3s also handle bass very well. Bass sounds full and detailed. EDM, hip-hop/rap, and even classical sounds crisp and warm.

I downloaded Tidal for desktop and Android to test the audio quality and compare it to Spotify. I get a student discount and opted for the Student HiFi subscription ($10/month). The M3s do indeed sound better when streaming from Tidal with this subscription, as I’m sure most headphones would. The sound is simply more detailed, especially on the desktop app with Master Quality Audio. This is not to say that the M3s don’t sound great when streaming from Spotify because they certainly do. Most people would have to pay $20/month for HiFi and I’m not sure that amount is worth the switch to Tidal. With the codec is set to LDAC on mobile (not available for iPhones) and the upscaling provided by DSEE HX, you simply can’t not enjoy the high-resolution audio quality.

Noise Cancellation:
The noise cancellation is also phenomenal. If you have not yet tried them, I suggest visiting Best Buy or a similar store to experience them. The amount of noise cancellation is truly mind-blowing. I tested them out in a dining hall at my university. Its full loud students and the sound echoes off of the walls. Without music playing and the NC turned on it sounded like a few people were talking from a distance. I was pretty much blown away. With music on, I cannot hear anything but the music. I could see their mouths moving, but couldn’t hear a word of anyone’s conversation.

Design and Comfort:
Compared to the M2s, I was first a little disappointed in the design of the M3s. I thought the leather, textured style looked so good on the M2s. I also was not sold on the copper/gold accents. I don’t think it makes them look like $350 headphones. In a way, this is a bonus because they aren’t necessarily thief magnets (unless they know what their stealing). The design has grown on me since I have had them.  And they are lighter with the all plastic design. Sometimes I think I have scratched one of the ear cups but I can just wipe away whatever scuffs or marks appear on them. The still look brand new after a couple months. More importantly, they are very comfortable. I usually forget I am wearing them after several hours and I find myself sleeping with them on.

TL;DR:
If you want bluetooth, over-ear headphones with the best noise cancellation on the market right now, superb sound quality, great comfort, and a simple design, get them.

I mainly bought them to use while I'm studying.  I just started going back to school again and I work full-time, so I need my solitude when I'm trying to focus.  These definitely help with that.  The sound quality is also amazing.  My favorite songs sound phenomenal on these.  The frequency response is excellent.  They even have a good amount of bass, though that's not what they're designed for.  I think they're pretty comfortable as well.  Sometimes I wear them for 4-6 hours at a time, when I'm doing my coursework.  They're fairly light and fit my head and ears well.  I was a little skeptical about the touch controls on the side, but they work just fine.  I haven't had any problems with them.  My only complaint about these headphones is that after the battery life has dropped 10-15% from a full charge, I notice a crackling sound in the right headphone, but only when the noise-cancelling feature is active.  If I switch the headphones around,  I can hear it on the left side.  When you're playing music or watching a video, you don't really notice it, unless you have the volume really low.  If I'm watching a video lecture or instructional video, where there may be pauses in speech or dialogue, it becomes quite annoying.  If you research this condition on the web, others have experienced similar issues and seems that not all devices are affected.  I've even tried updating the firmware as suggested on Sony's website, but it's still the same.  Perhaps I just got a bad set.  These headphones would have easily gotten 5 stars if it weren't for my issue.  Hopefully I can get it sorted out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm no audiophile, mind you, but I think these headphones rock! The noise cancellation on these is really impressive. It's AMAZING at canceling out white-noise such as a fan, dyer, or air plane engines. It doesn't fair quite as well with a stiff clap or penny in the dryer ... BUT It's still does a very good job at dampening them down as compared to non-existent with white noise. I'm also speaking about a test of just noise cancelation alone without music playing. With music playing you're going to need to rely on your spidey senses if someone were to walk up behind you and smack you across the head - you're not going to hear it.

As far as the sound quality, I think its quite a step up from the monitor phones I've been using and they are supposed to be professional quality. The lows are much richer in the new Sony's , and the mids and highs are clear and distinct. The superb sound quality coupled with industry leading noise canceling really takes these headphones to another level.

The only potential complaint I can see is if someone likes it being ear bleedingly loud. These get pretty loud but they won't burst your ear drums like some phones.

I was hesitant about the price, but in the end I'm happy about this purchase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sony said these would be lighter and they are. They said they would sound better, and they sound twice as good, especially after setting your custom EQ settings in the app.  They said the noise canceling would be better and it is.  They said they would be more comfortable, and due to larger ear cups (and the lighter weight), they are.  They said they would look better, and the narrower profile does make them look better.  They did all of this without sacrificing the quality of the construction (I sleep with these on, rolling right over onto my pillow at night).

For me, the much-improved sound quality of music is the most dramatic improvement and the most unexpected, although all the improvements add up to make these vastly improved over the XM2's.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The noise cancelling and sound quality is stellar, and paired with the ability to adjust the sound through the apps makes it so that I can adjust the headphones to match the type of music or podcast that I’m listening to. I bought the headphones renewed from Amazon Warehouse, and I was initially fearful due to the quality faults that other reviewers talked about.

Bose lags behind in just about everything, especially software, so it was easy to eliminate.

Surface has better software features but both sound quality and noise cancelling were inferior.  While it is possible for Sony to add these features, they probably won't.

What Surface does better:
- The biggest feature I miss from Surface is the ability to change connected devices.  If you want to switch from your laptop to your phone on the Sony, you have to manually disconnect on the laptop settings before you can connect to the phone. It's not a big deal unless you like to switch often.
- dials give better control than swipes; swiping on the Sony for volume +/- might get mistakened for next track as the can is slanted anyway and ""up"" actually needs to be diagonal. It's also nice to be able to dial down the environmental noise incrementally. It also takes a while to change volume with swipes.

What Sony does better:
- noise cancelling
- sound quality","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So to say that the timing of these being introduced was perfect is an understatement so let's get on with a bit of a review....

Sound
There been lots of reviews online about these it's no secret that the noise cancellation feature is superb on these it's also no secret that the sound is also superb and I found it to be accurate and pleasing to the ear no matter if I've been listening to rock music, classical music come or reggae. Another thing that I'm really happy about is that I can plug these into the TV through the 3. 5 mm cord with an extender and there is no sound delay listening to the TV but I have not yet tried Bluetooth connecting it with the other sound mode yet.

Hand touch features
The hand touch features on the ear outside of the ear pads is nothing less than brilliant and I prefer the motion touch ability to increase or lower the volume change tracks Etc by simply using my hand motion as opposed to a hard Hardware button. Took me about 5 minutes to get used to it but it was pretty intuitive and pretty easy to pick up.

They don't have to rest on the top of your head:

one thing that you won't see in any of the reviews except this one probably is that every pair of headphones I tried on at Best Buy and other places the top of the headphones almost always rested on my head. This was one department where Bose was a leader for me because I was able to increase the size of the headphones and have the headphones stay on my ears and stay on my head without the top actually resting on the top of my head and these Sony headphones have managed to achieve that and I give him credit for it. Having a pair of headphones partially supported with its weight on your head is not good for comfort factor so the fact that these can be expanded still stay on your ear and not be resting on top of your head for me is a big deal and adds to the overall comfort factor. my older Bose on ear headphones or more compact but that's to be expected compared to an over-the-ear Headphone set and although these are bulkier they are still quite portable.

The carrying case
The case that came with it is beautiful it's a hard shell case with a textured finish an open net on the back where you can sleep in a charger or anything else that'll fit and also has storage for your headphones inside along with two more what I call vertical pockets for your charger cord or other peripherals.

Headphone color choice:
I was tossed up on whether to get the black or silver headphones and I'm pleased to say the black ones were the right choice black tennis shoe look smaller aesthetically speaking and the copper colored accents really at A Classy Touch to the design in my opinion. Speaking of designs these are as far as I can tell 100% if not close to 100% plastic but they feel very sturdy and the joints on the swivel for the ear pads are smooth in operation and don't feel like they're going to break very easily unless you find a way to sit on them one day :-)

I'm not going to go into more detail than that because you can find millions of reviews online for these headphones and they will be going into much more detail than I am but I did want to point out a few things that you won't find in other reviews.

B&W PX  have a beautiful design and excellent upper frequencies. Unfortunately, this is the pros. In one year of use, I was not used to the pressure around my ears. Very distracted from the music. Patience enough for half an hour. With the head tilted, the headphones slipped off. Very heavy weight.
Sony WH1000XM3  has all the best. Gently sit on the head. Do not move even when you shake your head. The sound opened after 100 hours of warming up. There was a scene depth.  The basses are great. One charge lasts for 36 hours. The swipe control is very convenient. Material to touch rubberized. Good iPhone app. The function  DSEE HX was useless. Equalizer is more useful.

I have about 20-30 hours of use and have yet to experience a single BT signal drop. The noise cancelling feature is pretty great. So why not five stars?

Cons
1. The voice mic doesn’t really function for what I need it for (and how I think it should).
2. App/connectivity issues.
3. Probably not useful in some environments.

Details
One. I bought these primarily as a replacement for my wired computer headset I use on my desktop / laptop, thinking they would at least replace my wired/mic’d headset. Unfortunately, there is literally no functionality to be used as a mic’d headset with these. I figured since they can be used as a talk/listen device for calls on a mobile phone, they would function as such on a computer or phone apps. Nope. Don’t fall for it. Move on right now if that’s a thing you’re looking to do. It does state in the manual that these cannot be used with other voice apps on a phone (so don’t expect that either), but my desktop / laptop doesn’t even recognize there is a mic option with these headphones. No connecting to or using it Google Voice/HOuts, or any other VOIP app/recorder, either on the phone or desktop. This is a big flaw, and something people should be fully aware of IMO. It would have been enough for me to not buy these. I’ll be hoping Sony fixes this in a future app/FW update.

Two. There is no Windows (and presumably Mac) app at all for connectivity and settings (iOS and Android only). Windows BT recognizes these as a regular pair of headphones just fine, but you will not be able to adjust *any* internal settings unless you do it from the phone app.

BT battery reporting on the phone app initially did not work and said I had 0% battery, despite the headphones vocal prompt telling me they were fully charged 100% and being able to make all other adjustments in the app (fully connected and functional otherwise). For a bit of back and forth and power ups and downs or both phone and headphones, I got pretty frustrated and was ready to return them for a faulty battery as the app won’t even update the phone firmware if the problem was these because the battery is “too low” and since there’s no way to do it through Windows (USB cable or BT) I was on the verge of packing these up to return. Fortunately, in a last ditch effort, I disconnected and told my phone to “forget” the BT device and when I reconnected the BT device, and was able to finally update. Unfortunately, again, when the headphone FW updated it happened again despite everything else about the app settings functioning perfectly again (clearly a bug Sony hasn’t fixed yet). So I had to do a disconnect and forget and reconnect all over again. There’s really no excuse for the app not knowing the battery level when the actual headphones do.

Another aside too, it would be really nice if these has some kind of “disengage” option, at least for a time, to the touch volume and playback buttons on the right headphone even if only in the app. While it’s nice and handy and works well, I’ve also accidental paused and or advanced or changed the volume of these several times already just brushing it while trying to adjust the comfort on the physical headset. I don't see ever being able to sleep with these on.

Three. Although I knew what I was getting with this style of headphones so I don’t consider it a flaw, so far I’ve only used these in an environment of 70 degrees or less. They will likely be too warm to wear in in non-AC summer setting and I can see getting limited use in the summer months, which wouldn’t bother me much if these also didn’t have a low point operational temp of 32F/0C. While they’ll probably be fine for a brief period in lower temps, in Chicago it spends about 4 months below these temps, I don’t expect using them as makeshift earmuffs in 12 degrees at the L/bus stop is going to always work either.

Again, most of this is not enough to make me regret the purchase or return them, but I’d wish I’d known about a couple before buying. Hope this review may save one or two of you some frustrations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They are both high quality, but optimized for very different use cases. At the end, I decided to keep Bose and my wife decided to keep Sony.

Sony is optimized for music listening. It makes you feel you are sitting inside the orchestra, or as if you are the conductor. If the recording is high quality, you hear every detail and you breathe with the musicians. (Default setting is too bassy, but if you decrease the ""clear bass"" on the equalizer screen in the app, it becomes better.)

Bose, on the other hand, does not immerse you in the music. You feel like sitting among audience, you are not the conductor. You can put a mental distance between you and the music, so that you can concentrate on other things while listening music. Don't get me wrong, the sound is still high quality. And it let's you work.

Sony's ""ambient sound control"" is very impressive and innovative. Previous to testing it, I did not understand what they are doing from the advertisements and from other reviews. I thought they just let you control the level of noise cancelling, like Bose does. What they actually do is a kind of ""anti-noise-cancelling"". When you want to hear your surrounding while listening music, you turn surrounding noise on, and the headphone amplifies the surrounding noise for you, blending it with the music. You can put a human voice filter to this amplified surrounding noise so that you hear people but not other low-pitch sounds. They simply cancel out both active and passive noise canceling when you use this feature. You hear people as if you are not wearing any headphones. Isn't that the coolest thing? I can still be around, conversing with people while listening music privately. One thing they can improve in this feature is that I actually want to amplify human sound around me more than the natural levels. It is because I am hearing the music but other people don't, so they don't talk as loudly as they would if they heard the music. Even if I hear them at the same level, I still need to turn the music down to understand them.

If you are walking and listening music, forget Sony. You will hear your steps as ""thud""s, 3 times louder than Bose. If you will make a phone call or a conference call on your computer, again forget Sony. Its mic is surprisingly horrible. People won't hear you. I wonder if that can be fixed with a new firmware.

The touch controls on Sony is brilliant, works very nice. I can skip a song in a second, with swipe of a finger. With Bose, I have to search for that multi-function button every time with my right thumb and double click on it. Takes about 5 seconds.

The main reason I prefer Bose is because its ear cups are bigger and deeper. Sony hurts my ears after an hour. I am fine indefinitely with Bose. But my wife is comfortable with both of them. She may have smaller ears than me.

The main reason my wife decided to keep Sony is because it has much better noise cancellation; she does not get distracted while working.

From this review I learned that there is no one ideal headphone to get. Sony can improve by making ear cups wider and deeper, working on that thud sound, and using a decent microphone. Bose can improve by copying the touch controls. Even though its sound quality is inferior, I prefer that while I am working. Do you want to feel like in the studio every time you listen to music? I don't.

One last note .. Sony says it supports aptX low latency codec so that you can use it for watching tv and hearing sounds synchronized with people's lip movements. Bose does not support that. But I have to admit that I don't notice any latency when watching Netflix on my phone with Bose. Maybe that is not very important, or there is something specific to tv that I don't know.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Gutfrucht","These are great headphones","October 31, 2018","I truly love the sound quality and noise cancelation. I am somewhat a headphone freak, and currently use in ear and on ear headphones. Some wired and some Bluetooth. They range from top of the line Etymotic wired ear plugs with customer molds, to Samsung Icon X gen 2, AKG N60 NC, Bose etc. etc.
My job has me flying all the time and that is what I bought them for. The Etymotic in ear with the molds are awesome too, with their passive noise cancelling, but on long flights it is a pain sometimes to deal with the wire. So, I bought the Sony, based on the reviews I read.
First impression was ""Wow"" just for the comfort. Even while switched off, they already canceled the outside noise, though their comfy fit. After getting them charged, it was time to try the noise cancelling. I had the washer and dryer running, stood in front to them and pushed the button. It became silent, and their noise just disappeared. I paired them to my Samsung Note 9 via NFC, and the connection was almost instantly. The sound while playing music is just great, and I did tweak my preference through the app manually, adding some clear bass to it. For me they sound awesome, and I am very happy with my purchase.
I will try them out in the airplane on Sunday, during my next trip, but am sure that they will perform better, compared to the AKG, which is a great set as well. I also like the ambient sound feature, when placing the hand on the right side of the headphones.
As to the setting of different activities and ambient sound levels, this feels a bit unresponsive and it will take some time to switch. Not a big deal for me though, since I won't use it.
The phone function works fine, and people can hear me OK. Again, not something that was high on my importance listing.
These are the best over the ear headphones I have ever owned, in relation to ANC, battery life and sound. They are a must have for road warriors and folks who want to enjoy great sound in their own private space, even if they are surrounded by many noisy elements.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Most shoppers end up comparing these Sonys and the Bose QC35.  After extensively researching and trying both, I decided on the Sonys and I couldn't be happier.  The ANC is top-notch, indistinguishable from the QC35s and better than any other model I tried.  The touch controls on the headphones are great, allowing me to seamlessly change tracks, increase/decrease volume, and have conversations.  The latter feature drastically reduces music volume and actually amplifies external sound, making conversations quick and easy.  This is a god-send for someone like me who needs the ANC to reduce ambient sound (I have tinnitus in both ears and am very sensitive to sound) and then come back to conversations, when necessary.

The headphones are generally comfortable to wear, although my ears do get a bit warm after a couple hours of non-stop use.  Build quality seems to be great; they feel well-made and substantial without being overly heavy.  In terms of design, the Sonys have an understated elegance that was missing from the QC35 (of course recognizing that aesthetics are purely subjective).

The carrying case is nothing special, but it does serve its purpose just fine and protects the headphones reasonably well.  Charging is a breeze, although the supplied charging cable is shorter than I'd like.

Overall, I am quite happy with my purchase.  $350 for a pair of headphones is a lot of money, but I expect to get many years of use out of these, and their performance is excellent.  If you're in the market, try both these and the Bose QC35, it seems you can't go wrong with either.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_40?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=40&reviewerType=all_reviews"

These definitely muffle the environment on their own, but with a little music playing at low volumes you're not going to hear anything going on around you. I compared these to the Bose QC35 II at Best Buy twice, on two different occasions, and both times the QC 35 II with NC engaged gave me an uncomfortable pressure I felt behind the eyes and I left the store with a very slight headache; the Sony didn't have that effect. I've read lots of reviews on the QC 35 II and almost everyone said that's very unlikely to happen to the majority of the population, and if it does happen to you, will go away on its own as you get used to it. The QC35 II did feel slightly more comfortable on the head than the Sony, but the effect is negligible as the Sony are very comfortable on their own.

Sound quality is better than the Bose but both sound really good. The best way I can describe it without getting into technical jargon like lows/mids/highs/frequency range, etc. is to say the Sonys sound more ""vibrant"" and ""alive""

I asked my wife and son to compare the headphones back and forth and they both agreed the Sony's sound better.

The sound out of the box of the Sony is too bass-heavy for me. That can be adjusted with the headphone app that allows you to adjust the EQ which, when used with these settings below, brought out a very pleasant, engaging sound to me:

400 no change
1k +4
2.5k +6
6.3k +5
16k +5
Clear bass 0

That being said, just like people like different desserts and different style of clothes, our ears prefer different sounds. Those EQ settings might do it for you, or it may not, you'll have to play around with it a bit. Or maybe the default sound out of the box will already sound great to you. What's convenient is that you can adjust it to your ear's content.

Which brings up a common complaint about using the EQ ""downgrades"" you from the better codecs to the standard codec, SBC (which is all that the QC35 II offers by the way). Unless you're a professional audiophile or have the ears of a fox, I challenge most people to even be able to tell the difference between SBC vs the better audio codecs the Sony headphones offer (like aptX for example).

I love my pair of Bose headphones but these Sony are just slightly better in sound and NC. Bose is still the King of Comfort but if you're worried about Sony being uncomfortable don't be. It's like comparing the comfort of a Cadillac to a Lexus (some will just prefer one over the other even though they are both comfortable; that can probably be applied to the sound signatures of both headphones, too.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_196?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=196&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I returned both in favor of these.

These are hands down the best headphones I have ever owned.  They blow the Sennheiser and Bose out of the water.

Good:

- Unbelievable noise cancelling, almost too good!
- Super comfortable
- Lightweight
- Incredible sound quality
- Easy to use, practical features
- Awesome ""palm to the outside of ear cup to turn down music and disable noise cancelling so you can hear"" feature

The Bad:

- The noise cancelling is so good it's actually dangerous.  It effectively cancels out car horns and trains.  Luckily the app allows you to tweak the amount and type of noise cancelling.
- I never want to take them off","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Terrible connection with anything that isn't IOS or Android.","November 19, 2018","First off, I owned the first gen of these and loved it and everything about this unit's build quality is great. If you only intend to use them with your phone. Definitely pull the trigger. But they were absolutely terrible with my computer and amazon tablet.

And the reason was just verified to me by sony costumer support. The headphone's bluetooth connection by default prioritizes sound quality over connection quality. In practicality, under this setting you can't walk more than a few meters away without connection interruption. In my apartment and elsewhere, I literally couldn't move more than 2 meters or have kind of obstacle (sofa) in between myself and the transmitting device. Even sitting directly in front of my 2016 Macbook Pro, kindle paperwhite, amazon tablet there were occasionally disruptions. However, with my phone the Headphones app can prioritize connection quality over sound quality. When I did this, they were spectacular. I could walk 15 meters with multiple concrete walks in between me and my phone. But without the app on the transmitting device, it is impossible to enable this setting. Reviewing google, previous generations apparently had the ability to change this on the headphones themselves, but for whatever reason that was dropped on the 3rd gen which is seemingly perfect otherwise.. i never had to do this on my mdr1000x's though.

If you're using these mostly for computer use like me, you may be seriously disappointed. I was very excited about these, but I don't need $350 headphones just to make phone listening more convenient, need something to move around wearing while doing work. Otherwise what's the point of being wireless?

Sidenote: The app doesn't seem fully baked through yet even for phone use. Settings in the app seem to disappear and require re-setting often.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_194?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=194&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They are simply amazing. But not having a plethora of experience with other heasphones of this type it's hard to gauge just how awesome these are. I watched MKBHD's review on these and the Bose 700s. He still stuck with these as his daily driver. A co-worker has a pair of these so I got to try them out. I love them. A surprising plus was how compact the case was on these. It's small enough where I'll probably actually use the case and not just toss them somewhere.
--I week follow up: Still in love. Only issue's I've had was quality loss on my PC at work (linux) and that's because it's using the SBC Codec. Once I get it working with LDAC I'm expecting the quality to come back. I use these all day at work and then at home. When I'm going to bed I plug them in. They generally have 40% battery at that time.
--1 month+: Fixed the codec issues at work. I use these for hours literally every day. On a long day I'm usually getting low batter messages maybe an hour before bedtime. I still use the Case every day. It's pretty convienent.
My only gripe with these is I wish it was easier to tell Left from Right. There's a small L and R with the R being red. But in a dark room (spend most of my computing hours with the lights off) it can be hard to tell which orientation they're in when picking them back up. The Bose 700s have a large L and R printed on the speaker foam in the ear can which seems like it might be a better option.
For now I suppose a thin strip of tape on the right side will have to do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_26?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=26&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Noise cancellation is phenomenal and, unlike Bose's 35ii's, the sound quality isn't compromised by it. The Bluetooth signal never breaks up thanks to their ""signal priority"" mode (unlike Sennheiser's HD1's) and holy s*** do they sound amazing.

Full bass, crisp mids, soothing highs. Everything from classical to heavy metal sounds mind blowingly good on these bad boys.

McFarland","Power Cord","July 30, 2019","These headphones are flat-out amazing.  Noise cancelling is phenomenal and the sound quality is VERY impressive.  My one and only complaint that I just discovered is that Sony uses a proprietary charging cable for the headphones.  That was not a problem until I couldn't find the cable and just reached for a micro USB, only to realize they are not the same.  I found the cable but will be investigating whether I can purchase a spare.

Update: These evidently use a USB Type C connector.  I have regular and micro cables, as well a Apple's lightning cables spread throughout my entire house, but this is the first device I have purchased that used the Type C.  Looks like there may be a drive to make it an industry standard?

The sound is awesome, the ANC is good, battery life is excellent. And that's pretty much it for me.
1. The touch sound control on the right can is a pain to use, and easy to invoke other commands.
2. Inconsistent actions on the power button. Sometimes it'll turn off after 2 seconds as design, sometimes after 5, sometimes pairing mode will be invoked, sometimes it will give me a battery life read out etc.
3. Pairing more than one device is a PITA; you have to disconnect one before reconnecting the other. Gets real cumbersome when switching between laptop and phone.
4. Could not get it to work with VOIP apps on my laptop/phone. Pretty much a deal breaker.

The engineering of basic functionality on these cans is pretty good. However, I went in wanting something that was more general purpose and that could seamlessly handle my requirements. Should have done more research, I guess.

I currently use the Bose QuietComfort 35 noise cancelling and they are a great headset.  But I've never liked the Multi Function button.  When I read the Sony reviews, mostly very positive, I decided to give the a try.  General review is the headphones are great and they have unseated my Bose.

Pros
- Comfortable (similar to Bose)
- Long battery life (not certain how much longer than the Bose)
- Sound Quality ( a bit better than the Bose)
- Ease of functions like pause, volume, skip tracks, etc (much better than Bose)
- Range (distance from Bluetooth music source, much longer than Bose)
- Charge time (also not certain how different from the Bose)
- Noise cancelling (similar to Bose)
- Sony headphones app (does a lot of things to customize the headphones, Bose app not very good)

Cons
- The function touch pad is sensitive and easy to unintentionally do something like skip the track when adjusting the headset on your ears.  It's annoying when it happens but as time goes by I'm getting better at avoiding that.  And the Bose multi function button annoys me as well so no loss or gain here.
- They are large but so are the Bose, really the same size.
- Price (but the same as Bose)

I definitely recommend these as a buy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The controls are a little bit odd to use, although it is a pretty cool way to control volume with a slide of a finger. The biggest critique would have to be of the design. They are big and clunky.

Sound quality is really good, even with BT and ANC running. ANC may be slightly surpassed only by the Bose 700s, but the Sony is the more complete package. The sound signature is bass forward, which may be too much for some. The included app does allow you to back off the bass, though, so don't let that be a reason to not go for these. There are better sounding headphones for $300-350, but they won't be noise cancelling or bluetooth.

I consider myself an audiophile and I think these headphones are amazing for what they do. The sound and feature set are all really impressive. If you're interested in high end ANC headphones, these are top dog right now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_57?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=57&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This is my first pair of noise cancelling headphones. Before I had earbuds that blocked a good amount of noise, but these headphones are so much better at blocking ambient noise and more comfortable. I wear glasses and they are still comfortable. The only issue I've experienced with wearing glasses is that some ambient noise can be heard. Voices tend to cut through when in noise cancelling mode with the no additional audio being played - but turn on music and it blocks out all background noises. Great at blocking white noise. I use these in an office setting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_79?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=79&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I normally write reviews but after some time I think I should. I had these headsets for a while now and now I can give a proper review. I could not hear anything with low volume on I gotten scare so many times. The setting on the apps are cool too. Play with the environment and sounds and get a cool effect. Trust me try this. Listen to the song lil babe and put it on club and excited and you will sound like you are in a bass boost car. Like what in the world type of headsets are these. I highly recommend to anyone who listen to all genres of music and want a certain sound to go with it. As well peace and quiet. I tried them at school in a busy mall area hardly couldn't hear anyone it just sound like soft muffles when nothing is playing. when a song is playing on low volume too there is just the song anything else. I let my friends try it on and the same for them too. In the morning a plane passes by my school and I couldn't even hear that. The price is no but the result and yes.

The headphones have a pretty neutral sound, but the phone app is great and has an equalizer so you can adjust as needed. It has 3D sound (if you have a music service that supports it) that sounds amazing. Touch controls could be a little better, but far from annoying. It comes with a nice case, and I love that I can use them even if the battery is dead. Really, the only complaint I have is that the USB cable to charge the headphones is a little small - like 6 inches long, which is a bit of a let down considering the price. The noise cancelling ""atmosphere"" they generate can be a tiny bit uncomfortable when things are silent, but I think that's true of all noise cancelling headphones so not surprising. When music is playing, you can't even notice it.

These are much more comfortable than the Bose headphones I tried out, and they feel solidly built, like a high end Sony product does.

My last pair of Sony headphones lasted me 7-8 years (they still work but I needed noise cancelling at work) and I plan to use these just as long. I paid just under $300 and they were a 100% worth it. I would happily buy them again. Don't hesitate if you have been considering wireless noise cancelling headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews"

At first glance seemed really nice. Nice case, felt comfortable. Turned them on and I could still here everything. Put the tv on and it barely filtered it out. Next tried to put on music low volume. Still the TV was a big distraction. Put on my Bose QC 15 (yes, the very old model) and low and behold, with music at half the volume, the TV was not able to be heard.

I'm not a fan of the touch functionality. Double tapping to pause music causes a loud drum noise into the ear-cup.

Main issue is that it does not have noise cancelling control through an analog switch. So every time you turn it on, the ANC button needs to be pressed twice to turn of noise cancelling.

I've owned Beats studios for years, and felt it was time for an upgrade. But here's the deal, you can't go wrong buying these, it's a great headphone. The noise cancellation is incredible, the sound quality is damn good, and I like the option of changing EQ settings through the dedicated app. Where the unit falls is the loudness. I like loud music, and these headphones don't 100% satisfy that. Whenever I'm listening to music, I feel like I should be able to get another notch or 2 from the volume. Regardless, coupled with the noise cancellation, you will be totally immersed in your music, and with the battery life and comfort of these, you'll be able to listen for hour without an issue. I won't lie, the gestures throw me off a bit as well, but I don't care enough about them, it's quicker to pull out my phone and change the volume or song from there anyways.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_55?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=55&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have been on the Boise 35 bandwagon for a while now and didn't think that I would ever be able to stray away from them. Sony sent me a pair of WH-1000XM3's to test out and I have to say I fell in love instantly.

From the moment I got a chance to set these up with my phone and laptop they have not come off my head. The noise cancellation is something I had never experienced before. It feels as if the headphones are pressured to my head perfectly. I feel like I have been lied to by all other form of noise cancellation headphones. From editing videos, listening to music, or just browsing youtube videos, it all feels like a new experience with these things on my head.

To top off the noise cancelation, the headphones are beyond comfortable and have an extremely unique touch interface on the right ear. I didn't know how I was going to feel about this when I initially used the headphones. Swiping volume up and down/skipping/pausing songs by swiping over my ear felt very foreign at first. But this quickly changed with using the headphones for a couple of hours. It now feels like second nature and is a feature of the headphones I don't know I will be able to look past in the future.

To top it all off, the audio sounds honestly amazing. I feel like When I put these on it feels like I am listening to songs I know and love for the first time again.

Battery has been great to me thus-far as well AND it has a USB-C charger!? Perfect for my workflow.

To wrap it up, I am in awe with these headphones and I think they have blown all other competition out of the water. I feel like these will be my go to headphones for quite some time.

Thanks Sony, incredible product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_196?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=196&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Noise cancelling (4 stars) - I only like it when am on the train or seating in the office. When I switch to walking in the park or on the street, I don't particularly like the ambient sound.

It was pretty impressive, there was no change. Same when I walked into the subway :) :)
Sound quality (4.5 stars) - AMAZING
Volume control (2 stars) - For some strange reason I find it difficult to control the volume (swipe up or down). Maybe its just me but I think it could be better.

The ANC is incredible even when you're not playing music and it makes it a lot easier to drown out all the chattering when doing homework or something. The sound is great as well (remember, I'm not an audiophile) and I generally listen to pop, classical music, R&B, and modern instrumental songs and I must say the sound is crystal clear and even on the higher end sounds great. The build quality is good, I guess, only time can really tell, and I'm a huge fan of the touch sensitive controls and had no problems with them. I did hear that phone calls are bad on these headphones and I can agree they're not the greatest and the other person on the end of the line was asking where I was, but I really don't use phone calls through headphones anyway. Overall, awesome headphones with great battery life where you can drown out the world!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews"

For me, these do the job nicely, having wide support added with the app included for the sony's in the playstore/itunes libraries.

One thing, however with these models to be aware of is the build quality seems to be a possible issue with these headphones. Previous models have been known to have bad design around the head band, and for my model, these headphones have started to creek when I initially place them onto my head. As many people I have seen have this issue, this seems to be a design flaw presented in this model that is equivalent to other previous models. However, for that point, when well taken care of the noise cancel quality is top tier, as well as the sound quality delivered in many different kinds of environments, so for those qualities I do recommend, however be careful when using these, preferably do not use for vigorous activities outside due to the build quality possibly being diminished by usage.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've trialed both head phones for about three months now and both have their strengths.

Sony: Much better noise cancelling (night and day when compared to Bose). Battery life is more reliable and faster charging, USB-C advantage. More comfortable and classy imo than Bose. Hand over the ear to hear outside audio was a neat feature but most of the time you end up taking off the headphones anyway if it is something speaking to you.

Bose: Can switch between multiple paired devices seamlessly. Microphone is higher quality and reduces outside noise much better. Audio jack is bizarre, it has two different males sizes because the headphones don't accept the typical 3.5mm.

Both had equally as good a case but I would give Sony the win, as an avid traveler these were infinitely more powerful in the noise cancelling category and I could wear them for longer periods of time than with the Bose.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_35?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=35&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Bose does three things better: Aesthetics, controls, and microphone. I think the Bose just looks better, but personal preference. I'm a huge fan of buttons instead of touch controls, my biggest complaint with the Sony's is that I'll swipe to change the volume and it'll change the song. Finally, the microphone on this is just bad.

These do everything better than the Bose otherwise, especially when it comes to sound. I used a DT770 Pro and a BD 990 Pro as a daily driver for years, so when I put the Bose on I was astounded at how bad the sound was. I have $50 Bluetooth earbuds that sound better. The XM3s sound just as good as my DT770s, if not better. The bass is very clear and crisp, but not overpowered. Bose's noise cancellation might be a hair better, but I could just barely hear the noise cancellation ambiance, which annoyed me. Did not have that problem with the XM3s, and the noise cancellation is still very good.

Finally, the App allows so much more features for the XM3s thant the QC35. Bose's app is just... there, where the Sony app you can actually do a lot to customize the headset sound. Overall, it wasn't even a question at which was better. Sony easily takes the cake here","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_31?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=31&reviewerType=all_reviews"

BUT...

When I use these to make a call, it sounds like I'm under water. I was hoping that this issue was fixed when people started saying they got a replacement and the issue went away (i.e. they fixed the manufacturing issue) but unfortunately this is not the case.

Secondly, when I use the app to adjust the equalizer to my liking then use the headphones plugged into my computer to stream music, the equalizer settings revert back to default. Really disappointed by this as I don't want to have to buy an unlimited data plan for my phone to be able to stream music while at work (no wifi available).

They give you more than enough loudness and bass and are super comfy. Noise/Ambient sound cancelling is top notch.

Full Review:
I bought these Headphones with the expectation that they were the top of the line in all aspects but while they are absolutely phenomenal in Noise cancelling and ambient cancelling, they are most certainly not at all that loud. They are loud enough if you listen to music. At a loud enough volume, but personally I wanna feel heavy bass and loud sound and this just doesnt give you that. It give you a little more than enough.

What I can attest to is how comfy they are. I have glasses and a big head so if they were too clamping I would've had a headache. I've had them on for 2 hours with no fatigue or hot ears.

The case they come in is pretty nice and comes with the 3.5 mm cord that's a good length, airline adapter and USB C charger. USB C is great for charging time reduction and it matches my Galaxy S9's port so I can charge these using my phones charger which is nice","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_35?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=35&reviewerType=all_reviews"

That pair was excellent except for the physical flaw that eventually caused them to break, so I was hoping the new one would measure up.

THE GOOD: In terms of sound quality and noise canceling, they work very well. The Wirecutter claimed there's a sensation of ""eardrum suck,"" but I don't get that at all. The right cup gesture controls still work well toplay/pause, control volume, rewind/fast-forward, and skip ahead. The swipe-foward-and-hold in order to fast-forward isn't my favorite control method, but it does work (mostly; see below). So far, they've proven to be just as durable as the MDR 1000X were before they broke. It also looks like there's been a change in the design of the arch (What DO you call that part?) so that it appears to concentrate force more vertically; hopefully that will prevent the breakage that us MDR 1000X owners experienced.
The battery life is still excellent, and this model seems to charge much faster than the MDR 1000X did.

THE BAD: The biggest complaint I have is that the headphones often lose the right cup controls, so I'll be double-tapping like crazy in order to pause the podcast I'm listening to, all to no avail. It's not clear what causes this; sometimes I'll be at the edge of Bluetooth range for the phone and get audio stutter, and when I move back in range, the controls are still working. Other times, I'll do the same thing, and they aren't. Sometimes the controls aren't working and I've never been out of range of my phone. There's no way to discern the cause. The software app seems like it should allow for a lot more customization than it does. I would really like to be able to set the double-tap length, but I don't see an option for it. I like the voice notifications for everything except the notification when the headphones drop to 10% battery; I don't need that warning, I always use them until they shut off and then recharge them. I wish I could shut off that one notification, but you have to shut off all voice prompts or none, and the info panel seems to imply that the battery notification might not shut off even if you do turn off all voice prompts.
The controls on the right ear cup work most times, but often they have trouble discerning between when I'm changing the volume and when I'm trying to fast forward a podcast. Sometimes the fast-forward gets detected as a skip. I would really love to be able to change it so that a single swipe forward is a 15-second fast-forward while swipe-forward-and-hold skips to the next podcast, because I use the latter far more frequently.
The change from a leather cover to plastic on the outside of the ear cups makes them feel cheaper. It was a nice luxe touch on the MDR 100X that is gone.

I would still recommend these headphones to people, but without the enthusiasm that I recommended my pre-breakage MDR 1000Xs. I don't know if I would go back to Sony over-the-ear phones the next time I'm in the market for noise canceling headphones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I travel by plane around 2-3 times per quarter and using the noise cancellation on an airplane is amazing. I can wear these headphones for 3-5 hours and will not feel ear fatigue from the cushions.

I suspect she was messing with him by mouthing words in silence.

I'm in coffee show right now that's mostly empty (around 20 tables), except for my table and one other table about 15ft away, with a few women chatting. The MX3 does NOT block those female voices.

I've cycled through the three noise management settings: Ambient Sound - useless, Ambient Sound Control Off - muffled background noise, and Noise Cancelling - the quietest. The annoying sound of the coffee grinder is blocked quite well, but I can still hear voices around me. I'm not listening to anything, because I want to focus.

By comparison, a good pair of earplugs (Howear Leight Max 33db NRR) was better at blocking both noise and voices, and doesn't require charging.

UPDATE: I kept testing the headphones in various coffee shops, but they just do NOT block voices. They block ambient noise, but not voices.

And holy cow, every time I put these on it's like a wave of relief washes over me. Even in my home office with relatively minimal noise, the sounds of fans, coil whine, mechanical clicking, etc from my computer and other electronics are highly grating on my senses. These headphones mostly block everything out and it is amazing. More often than not, I just keep them turned on without any music playing while I'm working or reading. Mind you, they don't grant complete auditory deprivation, but they do block out 70% of the noise that my brain can't seem to filter out on its own.

The added benefit of the ""conversation mode"" (palm over right ear cup) is great when my wife needs me to pay attention.

Autism aside, these are incredible sounding headphones for the price. I have planar magnetic Audeze cans that blow the crap out of anything I've ever heard in my life, but they don't cancel ambient noise and aren't wireless. I will always love my Audeze, but the M3's are my new favorites because they lower my stress levels dramatically AND still manage to sound great.

Now all I need are earbuds that grant this level of noise block that still let some vocals through, and I will never take them off!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

-----------------------------------------------------------
Comfort: The head pad and ear cushions are soft but not too soft - as it should.
Fair disclosure, my ears has above average size.
I have more room in the earpiece of the QC35.
for me the QC35 takes this category - they are the more comfortable headset.
my wife who has smaller ears then mine says they are the same in terms of comfort.

build quality and materials:  good. overall the same as the QC35.

noise canceling:  impressive. a major improvement over the QC35.
they have excellent passive noise isolation as well.
compared to QC35 the M3 ANC is at another level.

Audio quality: The listening experience of everything I threw at them (except for classical music) was great with a warmer and more live sound than the QC35.

In the first 15 minutes of listening straight out of the box without changing the equalizer or setting they felt a little bit bassy - coming from QC35 good but flat listening experience.
the next day the bassy feeling was gone.
sounds of guitars, bass guitars, electric guitars, synths, drums sound great.
second sound/background sounds are clearly heard.
Even in familiar songs, I have heard sounds and layers that I have never heard before.
Some specific examples of my listening:
dire straits - sultans of swing sounds marvelous.
soundtrack of the TRON LEGACY movie by Daft Punk - impressive to the creeps.
In high notes classical music with violins and strings) the M3 are a bit lacking.
My listening has been partly of SPOTIFY and some lossless files, on a variety of styles.
some of my listening was comparative to see if I felt any difference between SPOTIFY's quality and LOSSLESS file quality.
I can unequivocally say that the difference is there.
Lossless files sound noticeably better on the M3. something I did not feel on the QC35.
I Always use my set to LDAC mode with ""priority on Sound Quality"" over ""priority on Stable connection"" - I did not come across any leaps or skips at all. my listening environment wasn't crowded with many Bluetooth devices.

Application: A bit of a mess, although there seem to be a lot of options, the features related to improving\altering sound properties are not available in the ""priority on Sound Quality"" mode (aptX or LDAC).
These features become active in the application only in the ""priority on Stable connection"" mode, which is actually SBC  - that is a bit disappointing.
Hopes SONY will remove this limitation in a future update.

Touch Control Interface - something that wasn't present on the QC35. it is comfortable not having to look for a knob, but you need straight and sharp movements on these, a small aberration left / right is enough to make the volume increase register as a next song.
The only touch gestures I have trouble with is a double tap (like double click) used for playback/stopping the music. It is also not the most pleasant one to use since the double tapping on the earpiece feels like ""BOOM-BOOM"" inside the earpiece.

Call quality / microphone - something I was afraid of in light of a number of reviews that came up on YouTube/Amazon.
I spoke to two people without saying I was using a special headset.
they did not complain about the call quality.
At the end of the call I asked if I sounded bad. the person on the other end said that I sounded fine and they didn't even hear the television that was working on a normal volume in the background.
I do not know the comparison point of bad reviews regarding the mic on the M3.
I'll keep track of whether there will be a change in upcoming calls I made using the M3's.
Relative to QC35 I can say that on my side of the calls I didn't feel a difference.

Video / Game Consumption - Watching videos from YouTube / Netflix a minor delay, non-issue. Action movie trailers feel just like in the movies (with deep bass).

Mossor","If you fly a lot, you deserve to buy these for yourself","April 8, 2019","... I did, and I thank myself every time I get on a plane. The noise cancellation is second to none (according to popular website reviews), and works fabulously onboard a plane except when reverse thrust is used when landing. The noise gets so loud that you can hear the noise cancellation clipping while it is trying to negate the external noise. When connected to the app on my phone, I am able to tune the headphones with the equalizer and spatial positioning, but I am given no such control on the MacBook so I am left to listen to them au natural. While they sound relatively flat, I feel like the response drops quickly from about 250Hz. Mids are great. and highs can be a bit too bright depending on the music type, but with what I listen to (mostly instrumental) it rarely appears.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was able to use them for a few hours that night and on my flight home the next day. When I got home I saw in my newsfeed that the M3 was just announced with new features like USB C, new processor, better design etc. I returned the M2 and saw on amazon they already were selling the M3. I was shocked as nowhere else seemed to even have them listed on their site yet for sale. I ordered them assuming it was a mistake and they would not show up. Well, they did show up on time.....:) NIce surprise.

I will say by impressions after using them for a few days compared to the M2:

-WAY better design, more comfy, lighter weight, more padding on top, better larger earcups and overall quality seems better than the M2. The changes are subtle but if you look closely you will see them.

-Battery life is incredible on both M2 and M3 but now with USBC its even a better experience. I literally put them on the charger for like 15 or 20 minutes and they were at 90%. Sony states that a 10 min charge will get 5 hours of playback.

-Sony claims that the noise reduction is 4x better than before. This is where I think I disagree. the M2's had exceptional ANC and these are much the same. You can still hear things going on around you with ANC on and its certainly not 4x better than before. The one area I notice is better is when you cup your hand over the right ear to allow the external microphones to let in noise going on around you, its not as loud and hissy as it was on the M2. IT still lets in the external sound but in a MUCH cleaner way without all the blown out noise around it. Well Done.

-I constantly read on how the M2's and M3's are terrible for use making phone calls. Reviewers mentioned how people complained of echos, terrible mic quality etc,. I was expecting the worst. I called my wife yesterday while she was in her car to try this out for the first time on a call. We spoke for about 20 minutes. She said that my voice was loud and clear and she would not have known I wasn't speaking directly into my phone, but rather the headset. She was in her car which usually would make it even worse so I was nicely surprised. I could hear her well on my end via the M3s so was happy there. I wonder whether this was fixed in these new gen M3s as my call experience was fantastic. My wife usually hates when I call her from a speakerphone etc and often complains that I need to speak into the phone etc so for the M3 to pass her test was pretty incredible.

-I am Happy they finally made a carry case that fits the headphones AND the cables that come with it.....M2 was stupid that only the headphones fit in the case but none of the cords....lol.....really?

-The Sony App is the key here too in that is allows for great customization of the sound on the M3 so i highly recommend using it. THe strange thing is that it supports super high quality sound like LDAC but if you make any change via the app to the EQ settings etc it makes you default to lesser quality codec......weird.....not sure why.

-I have heard some people say they are a bit Bass heavy but really with the app you can tailor however you like. That said i like bass and man these things can put out in a clean way where the bass isnt distracting at all. THese are very clean headphones and the sound to me is better than Bose QC35.......

All in all, very happy with them and i presume over time Sony will keep pushing updates to them via the app. For instance now they allow Google Assistant and Siri. Ive been using Google assistant on them and its pretty great albeit with a bit of latency to the responses.

Let's not forget how great it is to have touch gestures built into the right earcup too. Man I can't imagine not being able to do this now on every headphone. It's kinda like when your on a buddy's PC and you go to swipe or pinch the screen only to find their PC isn't touchscreen. Lol. Yeah the m3 is that cool. Love using gestures for volume, play, pause, skip, activating Google assistant etc.

All in all these are a great experience. Hope this helps if you are on the fence.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

It's still very frustrating that there isn't seamless support for multiple paired devices.

I was going to give this a 4 star for a single reason: it would not do dual-pairing with my Android phone. This would have the effect of me needing to remember to disconnect it from my Macbook before closing it, or it would actually persist that connection and not allow me to connect it automatically to my Android phone.

With iPhone, it's different. These headphones will hold a dual connection, but only allow music audio from one at a time. This has the effect of allowing my phone to take over, and giving me the ability to explicitly disconnect from my phone which yields music audio control back to my Macbook. The UX of this change cannot be understated. Seriously bothersome on Android, workable on iOS.

Still, the above issues could be improved by allowing dual connections with sound control from both. My $99 Plantronics had it. Why can't $350 Sonys?

I won't belabor the audio quality because I think other reviews cover it (it's absolutely phenomenal). The noise cancelling is magical. Can barely tell I work in a terribly noisy open-office plan, or that the old United 737 engines are loud as anything. It's just stellar noise reduction while keeping the aforementioned sound quality up. I tried Sennheiser's similarly priced models and their noise cancelling had a noticeable impact on sound quality (tin-y).

Battery life is great, and it charges super fast for a day's worth of battery (I'm talking ~10 mins to achieve that).

Overall, I won't let the connectivity issues bring down my 5 star, because I love these things.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

SONY doesn’t stand behind their products. Before I purchased these I had Bose. Two different times Bose completely replaced my headphones when they came apart. The second time was almost 3 years after I bought them. I remember thinking that there’s no way they would do something with them because it had been so long but there was no harm in calling. I couldn’t believe it when they actually took care of it.

I was really reluctant to go away from Bose because of their unbelievable service but I let the reviews persuade me to buy these. I loved the headphones for the nine months they held together but after dropping them on the floor  they developed a crack in the plastic headband. After a week the whole left cup was hanging by a wire.  I just got off the phone with SONY and they said NO physical damage is covered, even in the first year. So if you’re never going to drop your headphones you should be good. But if you’re expecting Sony to stand behind their product (which shouldn’t have shattered to begin with) then you’re out of luck.

They are pricey, but you hear (and don't hear) every cent of their sticker price. Comfortable, very good sound over Bluetooth (and excellent over a wired connection using the 1/8"" stereo connection) and noise cancelling that sets a new bar for the technology. In a work environment where I regularly measure crashing pallets and forklift backup alarms in excess of 85dB, the headphones rendered nearly TOTAL silence. It's so quiet, it's eerie!

Features abound. A one-button calibration process that quickly customizes the noise cancelling system for your specific environment really works. The ability to electronically allow SOME outside noise in allows you to know that co-workers have walked up to talk to you. Turn off the feature and you don't know they're there. The mix of outside noise can be controlled via a pretty decent smartphone app, which also offers other features (music EQ, power management, etc.)

Fit and finish are excellent. Honestly, I've come to expect much less from Sony compared to their heyday at the cutting edge of prosumer electronics back in the 1970's. These headphones seem to be a throwback to a quality and design standard that we haven't seen in a long, long time.

Material quality: it looks sturdy if not a little heavy. Maybe I'm not used to a headphone. The overall quality s good. The feel of the minimal buttons is fantastic and spaced out so you don't have to look to find it.
I love the touch pad to control volume, skip or let ambient noise in.
Sound: when the equalizer in the companion app is set to my taste, this is one of the best sounding headphone I ever had. My daughter has Bose 35 and it's lacks a punch and presence. Out of the box bass is a little heavy but it can be adjusted.
ANC: compared to Bose 35, this is way better. Sony seems to isolate more higher frequency and background noise but the difference is small. You can't go wrong with both.

Thank the sony gods for that because its not a cheap investment for most people. The bass is kicking, most audio is loud and in your face even on streaming sources like Youtube and Netflix. There's a slight delay between the audio and whats happening on screen but its really minimal most people won't be bothered. I can't really say anything bad about it I'm watching ""Bumping Mics"" in bed on Netflix and its super immersive and (hilarious) working great. Only thing I will mention that is a known issue with this headphone is that the headphones can become almost unusable in Cold temperatures without a wired connection. If the weather is below freezing 32F the Touch Pad on the ear cup won't work and it can even cause malfunctioning. So people who live in really cold climates this may not be the right headphone choice for you if you plan on using them outside.

They are comfortable with my glasses.  I was thrilled!

But the reason I paid an arm and a leg for noise-canceling Bluetooth headphones was for work - I'm stuck in an open workplace with lots of distractions.  The Sennheiser HD 4.50 BTN headphones just weren't cutting.  Also unfortunately, we still have Windows 7 on our work laptops -- I know, don't laugh...  I know.

I spent at least 4 hours today futzing with these things trying to get them to work with Windows 7.  They supposedly paired, but Windows said a driver installation failed.  Looking at the device manager there were 3 instances of Bluetooth Peripheral Device with ""!"" next to them.  (I'm not positive that's the exact verbiage; I'm on my personal Linux laptop now)  I installed all the latest Dell drivers, and even went to Intel's website and used their driver update utility.  I'm a techie, in the IT field for over 20 years, so I know how to install drivers and troubleshoot.

I reached out to Sony support via chat and all they did was refer me to Dell - after trying to get me to reset the headphones.

I haven't given up yet, but I suspect I'll be returning these.  I suspect they would work much better on Windows 10, but we're not there yet.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have tried many Bluetooth headphones and own the Bose QC35 II and Bowers and Wilkins PX.  I bought both the Sony WH-1000x MKI & MKII but returned them after weighing the shortcomings vs the cost, my main complaints being comfort and sound (the ANC was always good).  My portable-everyday-beat-them-up headphones were the Bose QC 35 II.  I liked them primarily for the comfort and ANC.  The sound on the Bose can best be described as adequate but generally lifeless.  Always in search of something better I read a couple of “First Look” articles about the Sony WH-MX1000M3 and decided to pull the plug on the first day that they were available on Amazon.  When I received the Sony’s I was pleased to see that the case was similar to the Bose QC 35, a little bigger but shaped well enough to fit comfortably in my backpack.  When I removed the headphones and put them on my head I realized immediately that these would be as comfortable as the Bose.  Good job Sony.

After charging for a couple of hours I paired them to my phone and went to my headphone test playlist on Spotify.  My main complaint with the previous Sony model's sound was that they had very little soundstage (defined as perceived distance between your ears and the music) and little definition (defined as the clarity and separation of the various instruments in a piece of music).  The M3 sounded better than the previous Sony’s and better than the Bose, but the highs appeared to be quite subdued and overwhelmed by the bass.  This was disappointing.
But, Sony has a phone app that allows for EQ so I go download the app.  Frustration. The app did not recognize the MK3.  Patience.  I figure that Sony has not updated the app yet.  So I wait a day and see that the Sony app has automatically updated on my phone.  I open and hurray! It is recognizing the MK3 now.  Now I can play with EQ:  -1 on 400 Hz.  +1 on 1K.  +2 on 2.5K.  +3 on 6K.  +4 on 16K and “Clear Bass” remains at 0.  Play music and now were talking!  I’m not going to say that these sound nearly as good as most of my wired headphones, but for everyday-on-the-go-beat-them-up-with-ANC these are exciting.  They blow the Bose away.  The Bowers and Wilkins PX which weigh about three times more than the Sony’s have decent BT sound when the ANC is off but the sound changes considerably and not for the better when you apply one of three ANC modes.  They PX is OK for about an hour of no ANC listening while sitting at home, but after that my ears and the top of my head hurt.

The noise cancellation of the Sony is a generation ahead of Bose.  There, I said it.  Most reviewers crown the Bose as the best ANC you can get.  Well,  Sony has just showed Bose that they are the new big boy on the block.  I did some A/B comparisons with both headphones and realized that the Sony not only cancels steady noise like jet engines or the sound of the air conditioning intake in my condo, but it does a great job of virtually eliminating all other sounds, including television voices and even other people, as my wife can attest to when she had to stand in front of me and wave her hands to get my attention because I could not hear her talking (so, if you want to block out your wife’s talking… LOL!).  And this is without even messing with the settings in the app.  Others reviewer here have not had the same experience, stating that it does not cancel voices.  I frankly did not expect it to cancel voices, but I must say that the Sony comes as close as anything I have ever not heard.

So, if you want very comfortable headphones with the best sound and Active Noise Cancelling that you can expect with wireless Bluetooth in 2018 get these.  They will not sound as good as wired closed back or open back headphones, but “you can’t always get what you want”, “nothing is perfect”, and “everybody is different”.

In addition to the Sony WH-1000XM3 during this review period I used:
Bose QC 35 II
Bowers & Wilkins PX
Bang and Olufsen H6 (wired)
Sennheiser HD650 (wired)
AKG 7KXX (wired)
Spotify
Flac files on phone and desktop computer

UPDATE 2018-09-21:  I did experience an issue with phone calls where people at the other end were hearing an echo of their voice.  I tested the headphones with three different phones and the problem occurred with all three.  So I replaced them through Amazon.  I am glad to say that the new pair does not have the issue.  After some tests with phone calls I will say that Sony still needs to do some work on the call quality at the other end of the call (the call sounds fine in the Sony itself).  In this regard, the Bose QC 35 is better.  I think the call quality is really with the sound processing that Sony has implemented and not the hardware.  Hopefully this will be improved in future firmware upgrades.  Another minor con that the Bose handles better is the support for multiple BT sources.  But this is a minor annoyance and I only use the Sony's for my phone anyway, so I am not constantly switching sources.  Small price to pay for better ANC and musical sound.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Sound quality not perfect.","July 10, 2019","I had my eye on these forever and finally got them when the price dropped to $300. However it was little too late. While looking for cheaper alternatives I bought a pair of $150 Beyerdyamic 770 pros and he quality of sound changed my expectations of how headphones should sound. These don’t have a soundstage at all really in comparison and the vocals sound distant in comparison honestly. I guess wireless headphones try to compensate lack of hard data transfer with software and Sony does a pretty good job at this. The sound isn’t bad by any means but it just doesn’t have an accurate, balanced sound compared to any wired studio headset. If you’re commuting on public transportation often or spending time in noisy environments then you’ll love these but for my usage I didn’t need an “on the go” headset so I opted for the best sound quality for the money and ended up returning these.

I will note that I use the song wireless extra bass over the ear headset for my workouts on a virtually daily basis and I adore them as they have remained solid as ever after two years of abuse so I’m sure these headphones are just as durable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_53?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=53&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I literally can't hear any voices or noises next to me when I have it turned on.  So i noticed one of the other Reddit forum folks mentioned turning OFF Noise Cancellation and the call improved. Well I began playing with the Sony Headphone app and discovered that by leaving Noise Cancellation on but dialing down the ""Ambient Sound Control"" slider bar more towards the right improves my mic response tremendously according to folks who have heard the before and after. I also set the ""Focus on Voice"" checkbox.  BUT I also noticed that upon playing with this further...it seems even when I slide the bar over to full noise cancelling - my voice quality is fine according to others when the Adaptive Sound Control is turned OFF!  I turned it back on and the call sound went to hell in a handbasket.  So I think if you can live with the the ASC turned off while on cell calls, this headset ROCKs even on cellphone calls.  Bluetooth has been flawless - doesn't drop or cut out.  I'm going to play with this some more over the next two weeks but so far I'm pretty impressed now that I got my cell calls fixed for now.  Wil report later if things change and I flip back to a Bose QC-35 II","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Closest competitor Bose QC3 Series II at the same price, only keeps ahead in comfort, size, and headset capabilities. It falls short in everything else, as Sony's aggressive push has put them at the top of this mark.

The one knock I'll provide is the microphone for the sake of phone calls is not very good - so if you need to take calls frequently with your ANC headphones, not the greatest option for you. Otherwise, go ahead and get these - especially if you have an Android device running Oreo or later and can exploit the LDAC codec stream this headset (and Sony) support.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I do wish they would automatically re-sync to my TV; but I am not sure if the headphones or the TV are to blame. I used to have a cheap pair of wireless earbuds that would auto sync to my TV, but these won't. I always have to go to the menu and select them manually every time.

Sound quality is very good but when I use it with aux it sounded a little bassy.

they work very well with th phone but there is disruption in the connection when you use them on a labtop , other than that , battery is very good they last long and they charge fast, music quality is so nice , as for noise canceling it's not bad , but don't expect that they complectly cancel the noise in a noisy environments like a cophie shop or someone loud unliss you are listening to music, but I never knew or tried a headphone that completely block noises when with out turning music, if anyone knows let me know please.

Inside are the headphones folded up, an airplane audio adapter (for those planes that have two 3.5 mm prongs), and a short (8.5"") USB to USB-C cable. There is a manual and a quick guide pamphlet that provides instructions through pictures.

— BUTTONS AND INPUTS —
There are two buttons: power and noise-canceling (NC). The rest of the controls are hidden as touch controls on the flat surface of the right can (earpiece): move a finger up and down for volume; left and right for skipping/repeating tracks; double tap to pause/play. You can also palm the right can to lower the volume so you can hear anyone talking to you without taking the headphones off.

On the left can, there is a 3.5 mm input jack if you want to physically connect this to a phone for slightly better sound. On the right can, there is a USB-C input for charging.

— BATTERY LIFE —
Charging takes three hours to fully charge. If you don't have time, a 10-minute charge can give you five hours of playback. Playback time is 30 hours with NC, and up to 38 hours without.

— SOUND QUALITY —
As Sony's flagship Bluetooth headphones, the sound on this is terrific. It feels well-balanced, with clarity of voices, a good middle, and the comfortable booming of bass. It's also loud and I had to turn it down a couple notches; if you take the headphones off while music is playing, people around you will definitely hear it. For Bluetooth headphones, this is worth the money in terms of audio quality.

If you wanted to adjust the equalizer, you can do that through the Sony Headphones app.

— NOISE-CANCELING —
I live in New York City and I take the subway. Lemme tell ya: I don't hear babies screaming, or overly loud people, or the sound of the subway car itself with noise-canceling on. It's not 100% noise-canceling but enough to completely forget that anyone is making noise. I've tried these walking along Park Ave and I turned NC on and only NC (no music), and I can only describe the sound I hear as a quiet city with just a fan blowing in the background.

Obviously, it cannot remove the sounds of people talking completely but enough for them not to bother me. For me, NC is always on when I'm sitting on the subway. I let ambient sounds in when I have to walk around in traffic—because it's safer that way.

— HEADPHONES APP —
There is a supplementary app which gives you additional controls. I will address these in the order they appear. Some of these features are interconnected and I will try to explain as best as possible as to what they do.

● Adaptive Sound Control: detects your action, whether you're sitting, walking, running, or on public transportation.
● Ambient Sound Control: adjusts how much of the outside world to hear from 0 (Noise-Canceling on) to 20 (you can hear around you).
● Noise Canceling Optimizer: optimizes NC if you are in a new location. Example: you can optimize when you are at your office desk; when you get on a plane you can optimize it again. It checks atmospheric pressure and adjusts NC accordingly.
● Sound Position Control: you can change it so your audio sounds like it's coming from the front, left, right, back right, back left, or omnidirectional.
● Surround: changes audio to sound like an: arena, club, outdoor stage, concert hall, or off.
● Equalizer: multiple presets with two customizable settings.
● Audio control: you can control the current audio playing: play/pause, back/forward.
● Sound Quality Mode: choose between priority on sound quality or a stable connection.
● DSEE HX: Sony's way of upscaling your audio files to be higher resolution. You can turn this on or off.
● Change function of NC/Ambient button: changes the button to do ambient sound control, or Google Assistant.
● Automatic Power Off: have it auto turn off after 5/30 minutes to 1/3 hours, or not turn off at all.

— DESIGN —
Not much has changed in terms of the design of this flagship model, it feels like a refinement for me. The headband arch is more oval-shaped and conforms better to your head vs the old circular arch. The leather on the headband and ear cups are soft and comfortable. The fit feels just right (not tight). The Sony name is in a gold-ish color (and it would've look nice if there were more gold accents throughout the black (like Jurassic Park's Indoraptor). The overall look feels like a distillation of good design. Simple, but elegant, and future-forward.

— SUMMARY —
I've been waiting a few years for a Bluetooth, noise-canceling, stylish, long-lasting, headphone. It's finally here and I'm happy with this purchase.

The sound is also quite good, with the punchier bass a plus for me.

However, the microphones just don’t work for calls. People complain they pick up background noise and make me sound ‘far away.’ Maybe I’m doing something wrong? I had hoped to use as a headset and the current perf here is causing me to dock them a star.

They’re cheaper than the new Bose headphones but they don’t sacrifice quality. The noise canceling is amazing and with the app you unlock the customizability of these headphones. The app gives you control of an equalizer with preset audio-styles as well as setting a Custom profile. You can adjust noise cancelling level from a full 12 ambient sound down to wind reduction or full noise cancelling. There’s also a neat adaptive ambient sound that will adjust the level of noise cancelling based on whether you’re sitting, walking, running or on transit. All of which are customizable to what ever level you want. Another amazing feature of the ambient sound setting is being able to filter out only voices so that background noise is cancelled but you’re still able to communicate with those around you. The headphones themselves are also very comfortable I wear them for about 6-7 hours a day with no discomfort or pain like my older over-the-ear headphones. My only complaint, which is less of a complaint and more of a small annoyance, is the touch controls. What I do like is the level of control you have, there is forward track back, play, pause, volume and Siri. My problem is it can be kind of finicky, it not horrible but it’s not perfect either. One wish I had would be wearer detection, in that removing the headphones would pause and putting them back on would play. All around I highly recommend these headphones other than some small personal complaints, these headphones are amazing and well worth the money","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Cupping your hand to the right earphone is impressive technology and you can instantly hear everything around you, take it off and the noise is again gone. Sound quality is outstanding as well. Crystal clear with an app that lets you adjust the levels to your liking. If you like a lot of bass, these provide bass you can feel! Can't say enough about these headphones.

Bass overwhelms these headphones.","October 28, 2019","My rating is based on what I was looking for in a new pair of wireless over the ear noise cancelling headphones.

I had a pair of Dre Beats Studio for the past 2 years and was extremely happy with them.  My primary use for my headphones are for the gym.  Top quality sound, the ability to handle Hip Hop bass without distortion, and noise cancelling capabilities are my main priorities.  I had an unexpected freak accident and broke my Dre Beats last week.

So I was in the market for new pair of premium headphones.  I'm the polar opposite of a spontaneous buyer when it comes to larger than normal purchases.  I read and watched all reviews, and visited BestBuy to get a first hand experience of Bose, Sony, and other competitor headphones.  These Sony WH-1000 came in first in every 2019 review with Bose coming in a very close second.  I really couldn't get a true experience at BestBuy.  Taking in consideration Sony WH-1000 being undefeated in the forum of 2019 reviews, I made the purchase.  Also, I'm a Android guy and Dre Beats are designed for and most compatible with Apple platforms.

PROS: The headphones are very comfortable.  Synchronization functions were very user friendly, and these headphones come with a lot of features and, a phone app.

CONS: Noise cancelling functions were not overwhelming better than my Dre Beats.  I personally didn't notice a huge difference.  Sound quality was very disappointing.  When the volume was turned up to 70% or higher the bass became extremely distorted, to the point where it wasn't an enjoyable listening experience.  Sound frequency would go from high to low for no apparent reason.  I filtered through all the equalizer functions within the app, and I was unable to improve the sound quality.  When I tried to readjust the headphones on my head, I would accidentally pause or interrupt the music.

I feel these headphones are designed more for leisure activities, phone calls in public areas, and laptop functions.  These headphones are packed with a whole lot of features and I feel this greatly takes away from sound quality.  If premium sound quality is a major priority, I would not recommend these headphones.  I refunded these headphone for a new pair of Dre Beat Studio.

Again, my review is based on what I'm personally looking for in a premium pair of headphones.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_26?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=26&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So it’s only fair to do a brief comparison. But this is from an amateur/non-expert guy who just loves his music and will keep it simple.

Sound quality: Sony has a noticeably richer sound, better base. Better sound goes to Sony for me.

Comfort: Bose are more comfortable and can be worn for a longer period of time with comfort than Sony. Top of my head gets uncomfortable with Sony for long periods over 1-2 hours.

Noise cancellation: Surprisingly Sony is better. I had already owned Bose and when I put Sony on to try at Best Buy...I was well impressed! And decided to buy Sony too simply based on how good the noise cancellation was!

Ease of use/practicality: this is about volume buttons etc. Bose is more practical and easier to use -especially the volume buttons. Also Bose can connect to two machines at a time whereas Sony can only do one at a time.

Quality of material: I bought Sony when Bose was 10 months old but within 10 months the ear cushions of Bose had worn out so not the build quality one would expect from $350 headphones(I called Bose and it was under warranty so I got replacements for ear cushions). Verdict is still out for Sony as it’s only been a few months but to be honest the build quality of Sony just feels better than that of Bose.

Battery life: Sony is the winner here by 10 extra hours! Tested both with continuous music.

I’m sorry that I didn’t delve too much into the “quality of sound” subject more but I’m just a regular guy who enjoys his music with good headphones. They are both good headphones but for me Sony is ahead overall. I chose to buy Bose first based on my reading of what experts had said especially about “noise cancellation” but after trying both as a non-expert, my choice is Sony. Though having both can’t hurt :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The noise cancelling is not what I expected it to be, but they are my first pair and I likely expected the technology to be somewhere more advanced than it is. Higher frequencies and non-periodic noise make it through much more than periodic noise and lower frequencies. The fact that it handles periodic noise so well makes me wonder if it is running an FFT to efficiently find frequencies to intelligently cancel, or that I just happen to be around periodic noises that are effectively cancelled by these headphones. Anyway, stuff like music at Starbucks makes its way through, but with significant attenuation, to the point I can't hear Starbucks-level music over my own music, but I can between songs (though it isn't annoying).

They are light and pretty comfortable for someone with pretty big ears, but I find myself taking them off a few times per hour to give my ears some air to cool down. When I am looking down at a book or something, they like to slide down unless they are tighter, which I accept because these cause a serious case of headphone hair if you have them on tight enough to prevent this (which isn't desirable when you are in public). But, they are pretty comfortable. I expected worse for closed back headphones.

The sound is quite nice and I deal with the extra bass to make sure the audio is coming in at high quality when I am listening to my FLAC files. When streaming, I would recommend just change the EQ to your liking because your music will NOT be anywhere near audiophile quality unless you pay specifically for it to be. Comparing them to my open back headphones, the difference is very clear. Not necessarily in quality, but in how it sounds. I personally prefer the sound of the open back, but they are awful to use in public and these are likely the best option to go for when you need to be in your own space in public, yet not bug people with your music (which is a really annoying issue these days, for some reason...).

I work in a physics lab and this is where I really appreciated these headphones. I have a bunch of fans on electronics running and vacuum pumps, large AC units, etc and the noise is annoying as can be. I put these on an even without music I entered a whole new world. I can't see myself working without these anymore. The lack of cable is why I got them for my lab (the ANC was for public), but the ANC became a really great aspect of these for my lab life. I was hesitant for a while about paying $350 for these, but being in the lab with them made up my mind-worth it (but now I don't hear my boss come in which can be awkward).

The case is amazing... though the storage pouch on the outside is on the bottom.... WHY? You made the interior separators so that you can't move them and then put the mesh pouch on the bottom... such a weird design choice. Otherwise, the case is amazing, despite the pathetically short USB-c cable that came with it. That was a really dumb way to save a few cents that did not go unnoticed. But, the entire package is worth it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They're pretty good, but I was not blown away by the active nose cancellation or the sound quality of these headphones. I never really really owned any decent headphones before so I didn't know what to expect but I've purchased quite a few flagships TWS earbuds this past year and in my mind, headphones should absolutely be better than wireless earbuds but the sound quality on these headphones is pretty much similar to the top end true wireless earbuds from my listening experience. The active noise cancellation is pretty good but I could still hear the outside world, and again maybe I expected a little too much, but I didn't know ANC can't block out all the noise from the outside world. The technology is not there yet. Overall I'm happy with the purchase even if I don't sound like it. I'm still on my first couple of days with these, so I'll give it some time to fully immerse myself with these headphones. I'll give an update once I get a little more usage on these cans.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought these 2 months ago, and I loved them initially. And to be clear, they are fantastic headphones. But after 2 months of REGULAR USE (aka, sitting at a desk and listening to music, not hiking through the Himalayas or something), the little plastic tab that holds together the headband broke.

So whatever, I'm a reasonable guy, and shit happens sometimes. So I contact Sony, and ask them to repair or replace it, because I shouldn't pay $350 for something that breaks after 2 months of normal use. Spoiler alert, they completely denied all responsibility and basically told me to go pound dirt, and hence I'm here, warning you not to make the same mistake as me.

Two quick details before I sign off: One, the part that broke on the left earphone, has now cracked on the right one. It's a design flaw, the part flexes more then it can handle in the motion of putting the headphones on & off your head, and hence it broke. They've had issues with this in their past generations of headphones (seriously, google ""Sony Headphones cracking"", its some pretty entertaining reading) and apparently these are no different.

Don't make the same mistake as me. I won't be buying another Sony product ever again.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_134?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=134&reviewerType=all_reviews"

For the sound quality ... this is not what I'm looking for, it's boomy and bass focused, so it destroys all other music details and background instruments and vocals (same like Beats).
On high volume, a cracking sound is noticeable which is very annoying.
Call quality ... I think it has the worst call quality in the world .. that my 10$ earbuds performs better.
Connectivity .. only pairs with one device at a time, and every time I've to manually disconnect the previous device to connect another one and it's a pain.
For ANC it's good if it works But after an hour or two of listening to it begins to produce a white noise on the left ear cup (so it actually brings me the noise instead of canceling it).
For comfort, yes I think it's good and comfortable, so no issues on this matter.

Things i dislike and hope sony will fix next time around:
- Got to say, calling while commuting in train, have to always switch to phone, quality just horrible, half of time people can't hear you.
- Touch control, is 80% on point.
- Sound for music playback cuts off / lags occasionally when phone is in the pocket.
- Charging while listening none existent, this one bothers me occasionally.
- My ears sweat like crazy in these, but i upgraded pads, so that fixed it a bit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_37?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=37&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Bose 400 didn't block nearly as much noise and turned off after 10 min of non use with a loud digital alert. The purpose for these was to sleep because the kids that live above us were trained in military tactics of driving someone crazy through lack of sleep. They would litterly keep jumping up and down and off furniture. The reverberation of the dance of doom deprived my wife from the sleep she so desperately needs as she works the graveyard shift and sleeps days. Not only is the music fantastic, you can fall asleep in these without the digital alert that they haven't moved in 10 min. I haven't moved in ten min because I'm sleeping Bose... Come on. Their app is fantastic really allows for great control of the headphones. Most of all you can't hear the young hellions running amuck like cocaine covered drawves home from the mines and generously downing pints of ale. What sweet relief. I would give more stars if I could. All the collected stars from Mario 64 for the peace of mind these have afforded us. My wife was on edge. Don't think technology can help a relationship. Think again because Sony has allowed my wife to sleep, ergo I don't catch the absolutely malice she wishes upon the children of the damned that prance above us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_38?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=38&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Bose would be my next choice. I tested these on a construction site  with very loud sounds. The noise cancelling function works on about 90% of the frequencies. I think both headphones can't fully eliminate the high frequencies but at least lowers the amplitude. I've yet to test these on an airplane. The touch gestures on the right side are cool too.

The sound quality anytime is amazing and compares to many open back headphones I've used in the past. The drivers are huge and yet still fit over my hear nicely.

The Active Noise Canceling (ANC) was great as well. As long as you have fairly active music on, these block out almost all noise. For example, I could mow my lawn with ""Hamilton"" playing and just hear a quiet buzz. Of course, you feel the vibrations (it's a rather large and loud gas mower) but overall sound is much reduced.
The ANC works best on white noise but still can work on voices, etc.
The app was functional and some people may enjoy it and the equalizer settings but I have separate apps for that, so it wasn't what I needed.
The touch controls were nicely functional and very intuitive.

Overall, these are great headphones- if you can afford them. Yes, they are better then anything Sony has to offer right now, in my opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_39?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=39&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Touch controls VERY frustrating.

I use a Senn HD600/Chord Mojo setup on my laptop (with True-Fi) for the majority of my listening. I did not expect these wireless headphones to have the same quality, but I certainly hoped for a wider soundstage and ""thump"" for an over the ear headphone so highly rated (and priced). These have been reviewed as a bit bass-heavy (?!), which they should be given their frequency response curve. That being said, even using True-Fi with bass turned up, these sounded very soft on the low-end (as a point of reference, my v2 AirPods were better). The Senn HD600s are not bass-heavy cans, so I was pretty surprised at the difference here.

Maybe I didn't give them enough time, but I HATED the touch controls. If your head is leaning forward at all, a swipe up to turn the volume up can easily be interpreted as a swipe to the right to skip to the next song. It was infuriating how deliberate I had to be to make volume adjustments on these.

I can't review the quality of the NC/battery/etc. I didn't use outside my home.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The good:
- great noise reduction performance
- excellent audio
- some cool features (eg suspend ANC by holding hand to R ear cup)
- Google Assistant (or Alexa) connection.
- comfortable
- well designed storage case - especially for travelers
- great battery life

The Bad:
- no easy multipoint connection. Although it is possible to pair with up to 9 devices, you can't connect with more than one device at a time. For example, you might like to listen to music on your computer, receive incoming Skype calls, while also accepting incoming calls on your cell phone. This is impossible (at least in the Win10 with Android universe). There is a workaround that allows phone calls with a connected phone, while also listening to music from a computer (or audio from a video), but it doesn't solve the problem completely.

Hopefully a future software upgrade may address this, or the soon to come WH1000XM4 that is rumored.

BTW, this seems to be a common issue with BT headphones, and will become more of an issue as time goes on and more people have multiple BT devices.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My personal experience was that, before the update I could not hear the voices of other people in my office, and that was WITHOUT any music playing, after the update the sounds could only be blocked if some music is playing, even then, I can still hear the voices if they come close. I used for 20 days on the 2.0.0 so it was pretty clear to me after the update that something was missing.

About the Sound Quality it remains the same as before, for me it's awesome! Very good bass and distinction of each part playing in the music.

For gaming there's a little problem, if u put the headset in the handsfree mode so u can use the microphone and the phone at the same time everything becomes worse, this is because the bluetooth divides the band so that voice and sound can be in the same frequency (this is what I read somewhere so I'm assuming this is the cause). If u play with a separate mic then everything is smooth.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have used both extensively on commercial flights, as well as in quiet rooms to assess the sound quality. Bottom line up front: the reviewers are right, the Sony's do have better noise cancelling, and the sound quality is on par (if not better) than the Bose set.

Where the Sony wins
------------------------

Noise cancelling. The Sony does a slightly better job of drowning out airplane hum, and seems to have a higher frequency range at which it can cancel than the Bose. It also has less background hiss than the Bose (in fact, has none I can hear) though the Bose doesn't have much to speak of. The Sony can run a test to tune the noise cancelling based on your altitude and the way you're wearing the headset, making it less sensitive to how you're wearing the headphones. I've found the Bose, by comparison, has differing levels of performance depending on how you're wearing them.

One of the nicest things about the Sony is that you can tailor everything from the app, ranging from noise cancellation settings (e.g. you can allow voice to come through) to equalization and bass response.

The interface to the Sony is also superior, with very intuitive swipe commands on the right earpiece taking care of most functions. Want to increase the volume, swipe up. Skip the song, swipe right. Want to hear what the flight attendant is saying to you, hold your hand over the ear piece and the noise cancelling switches to a mode where you can hear voices. Much easier than fumbling around for buttons on your head or trying to use your phone.

Where the Bose is better
---------------------------

Build quality. The Bose is arguably better made, and has more metal components and softer, higher quality padding. There are stories of the Sony breaking rather easily. Something they've supposedly fixed in recent builds, but even still, the Bose headsets are clearly sturdier. That said, I have been using the Sonys for a few months and haven't run into any problems.

Multiple Bluetooth pairing. The Bose set can pair to two devices simultaneously, and you can actually hear both. The Sony can pair with two devices, but you can only really use one at a time, and switching between them requires a bit of work. So, the Bose wins if you really need to be using two devices at once (e.g. your computer and a phone).

Where they are equal
------------------------

While I slightly prefer the sound of the Sony set better, it's hard to argue they are too far apart. It will mostly be taste. The Bose have much thicker bass, which I don't really like, but both have excellent sound quality, especially for noise cancelling headphones. Neither has much of the ""hiss"" that used to be associated with early noise cancelling headphones, and both have very clear highs.

Bottom line
--------------

Given the better noise cancelling and customization of the Sony, it's become the headset that I regularly use now, and unless you really need dual device Bluetooth pairing, you can't go wrong with the Sony.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I recently attended a weekend bachelorette party sober and could not have done it without these headphones. Even without sound coming out of these, they drowned out the sounds of 8 drunk screaming girls. This should be the test for all noise canceling headphones. Everything else about them is pretty good too. I would highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've owned Bose headphones in the past and I always thought they were the brand that could not be beat but wow was I wrong. Sony has taken it to the next level with these headphones. They are insanely noise cancelling. Normally you can hear all the background noise on an airplane (the loud wind your flying through) but I SERIOUSLY could not hear anything but my music. The corresponding app shows you how the headphones automatically adjust to the atmosphere your in. It's insane. Well done, Sony.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_67?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=67&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Wireless sound: Although I didn't use their top-end Bluetooth capabilities yet (I connected them only to my unremarkable cell phone), I am impressed by their sound quality.
Noise canceling: I cannot compare them with their direct competitor Bose, but I am impressed by their noise canceling capabilities. I just took my first flight with them and I was pleased to hear so much background noise filtered out. Although not all the outside sound and voices are canceled, the combination of the excellent noise canceling features and the noise masking provided by the sounds that they reproduce guarantee quite a relaxing and pleasant experience.
Controls: very pleased with the touch-based controls on the right cup - very responsive and intuitive.
Phone call features: I must admit that I was slightly concerned by the reviews that mentioned that these headphones were pretty useless for phone calls. I don't know if those issues were due to a bad first batch or to some firmware upgrade, but I can say that this is probably the feature that impressed me the most: I took work conference calls and personal calls from airport lobbies and noisy streets, and the feedback on my voice quality was very positive - they said that even if some background noise was still noticeable, my voice was still loud and clear.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The feel good after hours of wearing them as well.  But, the noise cancelation is just ok.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong but I can totally hear whats going on around me and other people speaking.

Tyler","Would definitely recommend.","July 6, 2019","I watched plenty of videos, read reviews, and tested the headphones at Best Buy probably close to a dozen times before pulling the trigger to purchase them. I monitored the price with camelcamelcamel and purchased them at the $300 price.

The reviews were correct about the ears getting a little sweaty. It will depend on the outside temperature, and what you are doing. Casually listening might take a couple of hours.

I did find when sometimes adjusting the volume accidentally skipping to the next track.

The battery life is AMAZING !!! I charged it for the first time after about a month, and it still indicated 20% battery left. I used it short stints, but thought the battery would go down more without use, but it didn't.

I got them primarily for the noise cancellation when listening to music, gaming, and using with my music keyboard. However, was still taken back by the price and almost returned them. However, I then tried them without listening to anything...and I was sold. They do such a great job silencing what's around you, so I stuck with them. I just have to figure how to get them to work wirelessly with the PS4.

In summary, I would definitely recommend ... despite the high price tag.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_40?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=40&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've tried alot of headphones before, and these are the most comfortable, great sounding, and best in NC. For those complaining about it messing up at subzero temperatures, there's a way to fix that on the help page for the Sony Headset app, they're aware of the issue and there's a way to troubleshoot it. Just take care of the earphone pads, wipe them down after each use so that the salt from the sweat doesn't make it tear, and it should last. And as far as people saying that you sound like a robot over the microphone on calls, maybe it's a defect?

These are among the lightest I've ever worn. The comfort level is fantastic, though after a few hours I did notice a little bit of weight fatigue on the top of my head, but I expect that from most headsets.  The overall fit is great, even over glasses.

The most important feature to discuss here is probably the noise cancellation, which is pretty phenomenal. I used noise cancelling headphones many years ago and found them to be average and allowed a lot of sound leak around where my glasses were. It's amazing to find a pair of headphones that don't rely merely on a tight seal to cancel noise. I don't notice any sound leak on these. It's important to note that the adaptive noise cancellation may make you think these don't work as well as they should. Be sure to tweak some of the settings to get the right noise cancellation for you.

Connectivity to my phone has been good, though I haven't traveled much distance away from my phone to test that. Overall pairing was simple and easy and the headphones were ready to go in under five minutes.

Battery life is also incredible, hours of use and 10% charge or less has been used. I highly doubt anyone would worry about these losing power during the day.

Overall, one of the best wireless headphones I've ever owned and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_45?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=45&reviewerType=all_reviews"

the XM3 has noticeably better noise cancellation over the QC2.
comfort of wearing the headphones: i feel the QC2 are more comfortable than the XM3.  the XM3 are comfortable, just less so.
comfort of use: the bose have physical buttons, which i prefer over sony's touch interface, which doesnt always register my touch gestures, so i have to repeat them.
i did not manage to simultaneously connect the XM3 to two devices. i could pair it with two, but not connect simultaneously. the QC2 has the advantage that i managed to connect it simultaneously to two devices.

to sum it up, i will use the bose when i wanna connect to two devices, and the XM3 when i want superior noise cancellation and bass for music, which usually means when i go to the gym, or on flights.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Listened to them for the first time last night on the bus ride home and the sound quality is excellent -- but I've only listened to 1 album so far, the Beatles' remastered White Album. Anyway, whenever the bus hit a bumpy road or sometimes merely changed lanes, the headphones would emit a single little crackle, very audible and very disturbing. Any one else have this problem?

Even though my Samsung TV supports Bluetooth, to get the most out of these headphones, I wanted to run them via the aptx HD codec, so I have them paired to a Avantree Oasis Plus transmitter, which supports the codec and also keeps the latency down; which I can't decern... Latency video test via YouTube look spot on.  Keep in mind I'm also running a Toslink between the TV and transmitter.
Only thing that would be better would be pairing via the LDAC codec, but currently there aren't any transmitters that support this codec, only receivers; hopefully in the future.

Coming from a pair of good pair Sennheiser RF headphones, I can hear even more detail... Those quite wispers are crystal clear.  The fit is perfect for long use.  And there's the noise cancelling, which you can read another hundred reviews on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This is of course the only minor con I can think of.
Sound quality is fantastic and so is the touch functionality on the right side cup. The app is decent and I like the adaptive noise cancellation feature esp when I use it to protect my ears from the cold while walking outside but want to be able to talk to others or listen to the noise on the street as a pedestrian.
Battery life is pretty good for my daily needs and when I turn on noise cancellation, the dome pressure isn't as oppressive as the Bose - as a result I do not feel nauseous on prolonged use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_73?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=73&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They sound great too. To my ears, they're better sounding than the Bose QC35. The fit is good. They're well made.

The biggest problem is that you can pair them with multiple devices but it is virtually impossible to make them switch from one device to another if they're both in range. I have resigned to only using them with my phone. It is too much of a hassle to switch to my laptop.

Also, buyer beware that the privacy policy of the Sony IOS app gives them the right to track all your listening behavior. You cannot opt-out. Bose used to be the same but they have an option now to opt-out (albeit buried in the app and defaults to opt-in).

Because of these two problems, I cannot recommend this product.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_26?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=26&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The noise canceling is class-leading, the sound is excellent, if a bit bass-heavy, and battery life is top notch. Overall, I really love these cans, but they have a major problem for anyone that lives in cold climates....

Anytime I am outside in sub-freezing temperatures (less than 32F or 0C), the touch control cup starts to pause, skip, volume up/down - all on its own. The touch controls become completely unresponsive to user input, which negates a pretty major feature of the headphones. I specifically bought these to use in winter as a pair of ear muffs (in summer I use buds or I'll show up to work looking like I swam a few laps). Google this problem; I am most definitely not the only one.

If you live somewhere that never gets below freezing, I really have no reservations with the WH1000XM3's. Unfortunately for me, they are not a long-term solution and while I generally prefer the Sony's to the equivalent Bose model, I have no choice but to go with the latter.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

These have changed the way I fly.  I even go to sleep with them on now (noise cancelling on/music off) on red-eye flights because they are so comfortable and they lower that noise from the plane to a much more comfortable level.  The sound quality is on point. I have Sennheiser 650s, V-Moda M100s, and I would put this right up there with all of them in wired mode.  They are great on bluetooth with an iPhone, unfortunately Apple doesn't support higher quality Bluetooth codecs just yet, but it's more than good enough for me and it's great being wire free.  I wish the call quality was a little better. If they had a detachable wireless mic like some of the gaming head sets out there, it would be awesome. The battery life, weight, build, and case are great.  I've taken these headphones on a few domestic flights over the past month and they've worked great.

If you want to use it for calls it is the absolute worst. Sony support is equally bad at helping with issues. Sony’s forums are full of users complaining about call quality and the non responsive nature of Sony. This appears to be a hardware issue that cannot be fixed with a firmware update.

Update: I have been checking the Sony thread where I originally posted this issue and I could see more and more people reporting this issue. And Sony has not responded to any of those with a reason or an anticipated fix. Instead they are asking everyone of direct message them. My experience with direct messaging was bad - after exchanging messages for 3 days (1 per day), the moderator was silent for 4-5 days. After this he arranged a call with their support team who walked me through resetting the headphones which didn't help. By this time I was on the last day for returns and I shipped it back. On the next call from Sony I told them I returned the device and they said I can call them back if I buy a headphone. And I didn't get an answer to my question - If I buy another one would I experience the same issue. Doesn't look like they are confident of this headphones being useful for taking calls.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Comfort of the Sony WH-1000XM3 is light years better than the PX. After wearing the headphones for a few hours I got no discomfort. They are also very light weight. Ear cups are nice and soft. Noise canceling is fantastic just walking around a busy city. I have not gotten onto a flight with them yet but expect them to perform very well.

I really like the sound. Yes bass is a little boosted and not technically ""accurate"" according to many reviews out there. But you know what, they sound FUN. I'm not a professional recorder or audiophile and don't like a flat and boring neutral sound. To each his own.  Bass is more punchy than the PX and certain voices at high volumes aren't as ear drum piercing as the PX. The beauty of it is, you can adjust your settings within the Sony app if you want a certain sound. I am fine so far with the out-of-the-box sound.

I am using a Pixel 3 XL phone and LDAC codec set to ""optimized for audio quality"" 990kbps setting. So far I've only walked about 20 feet away from the phone with 1 wall obstructing and I've not had a drop out in audio yet.

Highly recommend picking up these headphones if you want best in class noise canceling in addition to comfort and sound.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We both wanted them (was hoping for a pair myself)- ok hands down amazing sound quality and the comfort of this set beats anything out there. They are light weight and no pinch, it’s hard to believe your wearing them. I did some serious research before buying these head phones with a laundry list of what I wanted from an over the ear headset. 1. Big bass over streaming without requiring cord (check) 2. Full surround HD quality (check) 3. Ultra comfort (Check) 4. Real noise cancelling with pick up while on calls (check) 5. Over ear (check) 6. Easy remrmetable settings in off, call answer, volume on set (check) .. list goes on but those are my key requirements. All the reviews I have read about these Sony’s really competing with Bose and surpassing them is all true. They are freaking amazing! Now I’m buying them for myself. Really giving a hard core Bose fan a run for their money. Sorry Bose Sony really stepped up their game. Completely worth the money and I did purchase the extended warranty. I recommend that if you are doing over ear wireless headphones comparisons you add these bad boys to your comps list. I think not only will you be surprised about what you read because Sony has cornered the market on headsets, I’m willing to bet you will buy them when all is said and done. The cost is worth it! The research is worth it! If for any reason they don’t meet your expectations?

I can no longer use it purely for noise cancellion. If no music playing through, it will automatically shut off. If re power on, about five minutes later it will shut off again. That's very annoying.

I connected the headphones to the app on my phone and lowered the ambient sound settings, and it worked, but only on the phone. When I re-connected to the Macbook I got the same issue. When I connect to the Macbook via the headphone jack, I do not have this problem. But I don't want to be tethered to the headphone cord.  I did all the trouble shooting stuff in the manual and online, and tried to contact Sony support. I was unable to do this via chat or email because Sony does not recognize this model number. When I called they had me go through all the trouble shooting I had already done and then said I need to download drivers from Apple. There are no such drivers. The Macbook is entirely up-to-date on all its software and firmware. Also, the ambient sound is being detected by the headphones themselves. I can block it by cupping my hands over the ear cups, but it's hard to type that way.

UPDATE: After three months trying to get an answer, I'm told that the headphones are not supposed to work with laptops or desktops.  Huh. That's funny. When I read their ad copy on this page,  it didn't say WILL NOT WORK WITH DESKTOP OR LAPTOP COMPUTERS (It's still not there.)  Also, you'd think the design would be a little more sleek if they were intended to only be used by people with phones. I can't imagine anyone running or biking with these on.

This is pathetic and unacceptable. I want to return these but more than 30 days passed beforeI found out that this was not a bug and not a feature. If this was an Apple product, there would be several class action lawsuits and stories all over the internet.

(also, what that rep said about bluetooth was utter b.s. It doesn't work that way.)

UPDATE UPDATE: I read on the Sony site that the company was replacing these headphones with ones that worked if you called support and gave them the serial number. So like a fool I called support.  After several minutes, the person on the line came back and tried to lead me through  rudimentary troubleshooting (which I've been doing since November [see above]) and then he went away and came back and said there must be something wrong with my laptop, and then when I pointed out that people have had this same problem on different laptops and desktops, he said, and I kid you not, that the headphones are NOT GUARANTEED TO WORK WITH THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS, and when I pointed out that wireless headphones are pretty useless if you can't connect them to a third party product, he said that Sony has NO RECORD OF EVER SEEING THIS PROBLEM.  This particular support person also had the very annoying verbal tic of beginning each of his sentences with ""actually,"" followed by something that wasn't true.

This product should not be for sale.

- built in microphone is more sensitive to wind noise

I’m coming from Bose QC15s, and was impressed by how much better the noise cancellation is. They are comfortable, don’t have the ‘ear suck’ of prior generations of noise-canceling headphones, and eliminate an impressive amount of ambient sound. Battery life is outstanding, and they are relatively easy to set up. I’m not an audiophile but the sound is clear, with a tiny bit of a bass boost (which is easy to adjust through the app).

Minor complaints: my ears get warm, and there is not quite enough space for my ears.

Excellent headphones! I absolutely love them!!","September 24, 2018","I have always dreamed of getting something like this. I always looked up to those bose system headphone that my friend had, and I would use them.... so comparing these with his is a who different level. They are completely wireless! They are light and soooo comfortable to wear. The sound is as crisp as it gets. I do wish there was an option for bass though, unless I’m missing something..
you press a button and you can hear your surrounding sounds or “ambient” sounds as a woman speaks through the headphones. You can turn it off. And you press again and you turn on the noise cancellation. The cancellation of blocs is incredible. It’s like you are watching things around you and people talk but you don’t hear ANYTHING (maybe 95 percent of it is completely noise cancelled).
The Bluetooth connection took literally 1 second. I just love the feel of them as well and the look so slick. If you are worried about the battery life, it’s like 30 hours! It also came in a very nice case, and the headphones fold easily for efficient space.
I would most definitely recommend these for leisure, music, flights, whatever whenever..
I hope I was helpful. Thank you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_197?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=197&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's also rather comfortable once I adjust it the right way, so much so that I don't really need the Bose QC35 for comfort (I was able to wear it for 5 hours straight without taking them off once). The sound quality is also good enough for me, especially since I can EQ it to what setting I choose.

However, there are a few issues that have developed with the headphones. For one, the hinges have started to creak when I try to stretch them out, this probably has something to do with the plastic build and I'm particularly concerned for how it will hold up in the future. Another is that the Bluetooth connection with LDAC has begun to crackle all the time in the short time that I've had it, which forces me to switch to the SBC codec which is more stable but results in less quality. This could be my source device (Sony Xperia Z1) or the headphones, but whichever one it is it's not good at all.

And I like many others wish they would make a proper form of multi-device pairing, because as it is now you can only connect to the phone for call purposes and to a 2nd device for media. While this may be a way to accomplish it, I feel that it's a lot more complicated to do that than whatever it is that others such as Bose and Sennheiser do.

But as long as they don't break, I feel I can live with them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Since receiving these I've flown cross country roundtrip, set them up for music and movies on my Samsung Note 8, and set them up for taking conference calls using both Microsoft Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams on my Dell laptop.  A couple of things I've noted - they won't connect to my phone and Dell laptop at the same times which leads to disconnecting from one to connect to another.  Second is while they work seamlessly with Teams, Skype for Business takes a little more set up.  I've asked people on the other end how the mic sound and they said I sound fine.

Sony support was rude when I called them about this issue and it's frustrating because of how much they cost.

LDAC is a bit higher quality, but APTX provides lower latency, so it's good you can choose between them based on your uses. The headphones are a bit tight, but overall very comfortable. I guess they will adjust once I 'break them in'. Noise cancelling is very nice, though I still haven't tested them on a very noisy environment (like plane and such). Touch controls are working very good , and covering the ear cup to hear someone around you is a very nice added feature. The traveling case is very nice and relatively compact.

1) They are a little bit heavy so make sure to reaaaallllyyyyy adjust the headset to fit TIGHT on you, else it will fall easily
2) The noise cancellation isn't that great. The only two settings that work are full noise cancellation and none. Those adjustments between them are really not that smooth in transition.
3) The noise cancellation in this is a little bit weird, sort of feels like pressure is being reduced around your ears so your balance does go a little bit off every time you wear and take off the headphone.
4) The touch controls are wonky, most times they work and some times they don't. But you really gotta be exact with your movements else they won't work at all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews"

For the weeks prior to my tax refund check arriving, I debated the Sony Wh-1000mx3's and the Bose QC 35 ii's, I obviously went with the former of the two.
These arrived in a very timely manner, and the first thing I noticed out the gate was the immaculate and incredible presentation, huge shout out to Sony on that regard! After trying these headphones on I noticed how incredibly comfy they are, since owning them I have worn them for hours on end.  Once I got the app setup through with, which was very easy and straightforward, I put these cans on, and man do they deliver! I listen to a lot of EDM, which consists of a lot of bass, and treble both that balance each other out.  These headphones deliver in both departments.  The bass is nice and punchy, with a good thundering sound to it, and the treble is crystal clear, with no distortion.  I've also listened to other genres such as Rock, Pop, Rap, and a little bit of Country to try these out, and these sound incredible across the board! Another really awesome feature is the EQ, which is by no means a gimmick, as in other pairs of headphones/earbuds.  Each individual preset in the EQ completely changes the sound, it's mind blowing!! The noise cancellation is also better than I was let to believe.  Once you put these on, you are in your own world, surrounded by your favorite music.  One of the first things I did when I got these headphones, was took them outside to test the cold weather glitch, because it was below freezing when I received these.  If you're not familiar with the cold weather glitch, it's where the touch controls bug out in temperatures below 40 degrees Fahrenheit.  The issue was prevalent in the other reviews I read, and I can attest that my set did it as well, but it's only a minor annoyance in my case, and I can definitely live with it.  The only other annoyance I noticed was that my model started creaking whenever flexing the headband to put them on, but this has not caused any structural issues in the 4 months that I've had them.

Overall Pros/Cons
Pros:
Fantastic Sound
Solid EQ
Exceptional Noise Cancellation
Lightweight, comfortable feel.

Cons:
Touch controls malfunction in cold weather
May start creaking

Final Verdict:
Overall these are a fantastic buy.  I have been loving and enjoying them on day 1, I would 10/10 buy these again! I feel like these are worth every penny out of the $350 price tag, but if you can get them cheaper, then by all means go for it!!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Doggett","Better Than Bose 700.","November 22, 2019","I have been a Bose ANC headphone owner for decades.  So I was really excited when the Bose 700 was released.  What a disaster the Bose 700s are.  The Bose Music app is trash.  I was constantly trying to keep it connected to Bluetooth.  It is impossible to turn off, so I had to set the ""auto-shut off"" feature to 5 minutes so the battery wouldn't run down.  I sent the first unit back.  The second unit was a little better, but it is very difficult to pair it with a second deice and it still won't turn off manually.

I was so frustrated with the Bose 700s that I decided to try the Sony.  I am so glad that I did.  The sound is slightly richer.  The Noise cancellation is better.  The on ear swipe controls are flawless.  And, most important, it is brain-dead easy to pair them and keep them paired.  Finally, I can turn them off manually.

I found myself constantly taking the headphones on and off to compare, because I just couldn't believe how well they worked. I walked home that day with pair of these headphones. 2 months later and they look as good as new, despite my inclination to abuse electronics.

I've enjoyed these headphones immensely, so much in fact, that I ended up purchasing another pair for my dad's enjoyment.

The major flaw is lack of microphone support. The headset is unable to function both as a microphone/speaker as well as listen to background programs at the same time in a computer. Meaning, if you're program for the microphone/speaker (discord/skype) is separate from your other programs, such as games, then you won't hear your games! This is due to a bluetooth limitation, which you can read about online. If the program you want to listen to includes the voice co-op, then you won't have an issue. There's no separate auxiliary slot for the microphone also. Important limitation for something so pricey.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_70?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=70&reviewerType=all_reviews"

In a noisy café, totally cancels out ventilation hum and other background noise, leaving only some faint remnants in the form of people's talk etc. At home, very effectively cancels out random baby noises, including crying. Haven't tried in a jet yet. Material quality top notch - and very lightweight. Battery life could not be batter.
Now to sound quality: kind of OK, at most. Nowhere close to my wired Sennheisers ($200 from Massdrop). Require equalizer to be applied immediately out of the box, to get the highs back - by default these headphones will totally muffle the music. But - I listen at low volume anyway, and so I don't really feel like it hurts me.
Some people report problems with microphone - I didn't have issues when talking both on Skype and over cellular. People didn't complain about me being quiet any more than they would with my wired AKG earplugs with microphone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It’s great to go for walks and relax with them on. I like the fact that they cover the whole ear. The few negatives are that it’s really hard to consistently quickly pause music with the head piece touch device. Also if you have slightly bigger ears it will put some pressure on them causing discomfort. If you have multiple devices you have to sync them and it doesn’t automatically sync to both. It gets hot pretty quickly in my experience even when I am sitting at a desk and at this point I just let myself sweat on them. You have to wipe them down with a damp cloth if you want to maintain the padding. If you like slightly more bass than the Bose I would also get these headphones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Where as the noise canceling is like turning the world around  you off.  Just astounding.  The comfort is really nice.  I wear headphones for multiple hours a day (sometimes as much as 4 or 5 continuously) and these never strain my ears or feel uncomfortable.

Probably my largest ""complaint"" is the ""clever"" control surface on the outside of ear cup.  The two buttons are fine and easy to find, but the gestures methods are just 'ok'.  I've skipped songs I'm trying to change the volume on and I've tapped my headphones over and over to try and pause or unpause.

A week later, my wife surprised me with a pair of Bose QC 35s (forgetting that I had already purchased the Sony's).  I opened the Bose QC in order to test them, figuring I would keep the better of the two and sell the others.

The reviews I had read were pretty much even between the two.  Nothing really gave me confidence that one was better for my uses or my preferences than the other.  Now after having both, I can say that I strongly prefer and recommend the Sony over the Bose.

First and foremost - the sound out of the Sony WH1000XM3 is not only better, but you can customize it using the app.
 Tweak everything about the sound in the app.  This is, to me the biggest point because the Bose QC 35's are surprisingly lacking in bass.  I own a pair of Bose SoundSports which are great for working out, with great bass right out of the box - which is why I was so surprised that the QC would pack less of a punch than their in-ear buds.  The Sony WH1000XM3 out of the box sounds good, but the ability to customize the sound through the equalizer in the app is a huge advantage over the Bose QC 35s.

The touch controls on the Sony are great as well.  Intuitive and responsive.  The controls on the Bose are straight forward and work fine, but I do like the ability to just reach up and swipe, tap, or put my hand over the ear cup to hear the ambient sounds as opposed to finding the right button (first world problem, I know, but it is a great feature).

The noise canceling is indistinguishable to me.  Both work great.  I could not tell a difference as I switched between the two of them while watching TV, or observing the kids while arguing.  I wore the Sony for a 2.5 hour flight with no fatigue or discomfort at all.  Not sure about the Bose, but I don't think they would cause any issues or discomfort - they feel pretty much the same on the head/ears.

A couple additional small wins for Sony:
The fact that the case comes with small sectioned off areas separated by cloth for your 3.5mm jack and USB.  Bose does not have this, which means you can use the pocket on the cover (one inside and one outside) but if you use the one inside the cords are pressed into the ear cups.
Sony uses USB-C.  No guessing which side is up when plugging into the headphones to charge.
Sony comes with an Airplane jack adapter.  Even though most airlines use the single prong input now, it's nice to have, just in case.

If Bose had an equalizer, the sound could most likely be made to be equal, if not better than the Sony.  But the equalizer feature on the Sony WH1000XM3 enables me to really dial in the sound, leaving the Bose sounding flat in comparison.  That alone puts them over the top for me.  The additional features alone would not be enough for me to accept inferior quality, but I don't have to.  All of it together puts Sony way out ahead in my opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Noise cancelling is superb.  They are comfy.  I use them as a phone headset a lot.  That is where battery life shines.  They run all day with plenty of charge to spare.  The phone audio is just what I needed.  Listening over a mediocre phone connection to a person who's English accent is way different than mine as always been a serious communication issue for both of us.  These headphones help that a lot on my end.  They won't clean up a bad signal but they will kill all the background noise and keep the pieces of the call transparent.  Of course, they work great for music or plugged into Roku for TV.

Meh:  They are called silver but most of the color is beige.  Not a fan of beige but they look OK.

Cons:  When using Sony's Adaptive Sound Control (on by default) in the Sony Android app, the geniuses @ Sony decided they needed to mute the incoming audio and chime in your ears for a second every time they adjust the headphones to adapt to ambient sound changes.  Most sound people I know would endure torture before introducing noise (the chime sound) and muting the audio signal on purpose.  For reference, this happens even when all I do is walk across a relatively quite house.  This renders Adaptive Sound Control completely useless.  For me, I leave Adaptive Sound Control off and only use Noise cancellation which does not do that.  It took me half an hour to figure out what it was.  What were they thinking???  It doesn't show up on the Android notification screen so it's hard to figure out what is causing it.  I can turn it off so I'm good.
The documentation is skimpy too.

Not worth that price.","September 4, 2018","I'll start by saying that I'm by no mean an aficionado of wireless headphones. I never really owned any. And I don't mind using my good old wired jack headphones.
Nevertheless, even I can't deny that something like ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) is useful when in a plane, or even outside.

Now, these cost $350 (+tax) at the time of this review. And I honestly have a hard time believing this is the finished product for that price and for the third iteration of that model.

The good:
• They're very light (see a cons to that below)
• They fold
• USB-C charging
• Good battery life (for the 2 days I tested them)
• In my opinion, rather good looking (although I really don't care that much)
• Actually really good touch controls.
• ANC is rather good also. But I don't have any point of comparison here...
And... that's it I'm afraid :-/

The bad:
• They're so light they feel really cheap
• Bassy is an understatement
• They sound... flat. No precision. No dynamics. Bass is overwhelming and everything ends up being a mellow that lacks any sort of clarity.
• Bluetooth is still not good enough. Maybe BT 5 will improve the situation (these are BT 4 if I'm not mistaking). But in the meantime, these still drop the connection every so often for half a second or something (I'm talking multiple times an hour)
• They added mics for the ANC on this version. So much so that you can hear the WIND as feedback when the ANC kicks in... I'm not buying ANC headphones to hear the wind ><
• Android app doesn't work (more details below)

All in all. These are $350 headphones that are bluetooth (which, in my opinion, brings more issues that is fixes, I don't care about the wire, and I have to charge these, and suffer the unreliability of BT. Also they are not even BT multipoint so... can't have them paired with multiple devices...). But they don't sound the part. And the ANC is faulty.

Also, at the time of release, the Android app is not updated. If you download whatever the current version was, it would complain that it's not compatible with this version, and prompt you to update it. Except there is no update available.

So all in all. Mostly a bad experience all around. The sound is not good enough. The app doesn't work. BT is still crappy. And ANC can't survive any medium amount of wind (which is a daily thing where I live).
I didn't own them long enough to really judge battery life and charging time I'm afraid.

Mc","Nice headphones, with great software capabilities to tweak NC and audio.","September 2, 2018","See below for update!

So far, my experienced is mixed.  The current version of the Sony Headphone Connect app on iOS doesn’t support these.  Talk about poorly planned release. So, none of the advance capabilities are available, and therefore are currently basic Bluetooth headphones with noise cancelling....that you can’t adjust.  Fortunately, the default NC profile is good, and they do sound good.  Also, they are lighter than the XM2s, but the headband feels more solidly built.  I think they also sound better (clarity, dynamics, bass) than the XM2 and QC35.  Comfort is very good, not quite as good as Bose QC35, but pretty close.

Update: about 12hrs after posting this, Sony has released the updated software to the iOS App Store.  Works great with the software.  Allows for tweaking and calibration of NC, eq, etc.  sweet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

The battery on those was only lasting about 12 hours vs the advertised 15 so I returned them and got these. Let me say the noise cancelling is slightly better however so huge key issues made me return these and go back to the surface headphones. The biggest issue was the mic on this. On calls I had to constantly hold my phone to my mouth otherwise people would say they couldn’t hear me. Another huge issue was whenever I was in a call the noise cancelling would stop. I bought these for cancelling noise during calls primarily as we are all in agile environment at work. Those two issues made this unusable for me and I feel if I am spending $350 for headphones I should not regret my purchase and miss features. If you just want these for litesning to music and cancelling noise these would be very good, however if you plan on using for calls at all, pass and go for the surface headphones.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_37?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=37&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was hesitant to spend so much on Sony but decided to give it a try. I own beats studio and Bose wired noise canceling headphones.  These are a perfect balance with great noise canceling. Sound quality is amazing. I have only had a couple days and don’t notice I’m wearing them. I was a little worried about using these when answering my phone based off others reviews, but the phone calls sound crystal clear and no problem with the mic picking up my voice.  The touchless panel took a min to get use to with swiping for sound and tapping for song changes. Not sure how well the touch panel will work if hands are sweaty. Overall I am super happy with what Sony has done.  I will update my review if anything changes in the future. Until then I will enjoy these as my go to headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

These headphones are easily one of the best headphones anyone should own because they are truly worth every penny.  I used to own a pair of Apple Beats Studio 3s which did have ANC but they were over $300 and the ANC quality was very poor.  I then went ahead and returned them and bought Airpods (2nd Gen).  They worked great with my iPhone and Macbook but it just didn’t fit well enough in my ear and it didn’t have ANC.  I began my research and found that many sources claim that the Sonys either met or exceeded the Noise Cancellation quality of the Bose NC700.  I also found that the Sonys have great sound quality, excellent bass, and an app that can allow you access to the headphones customization features.  After buying them, I went through all of the features and tested them out to see why these headphones had such great comments.  I setup my headphones for the first time which was a breeze (not as easy as setting up my airpods, but it was relatively easy).  As soon as I put the headphones on, they were extremely comfortable, all ambient noises and voices were minimized, and there was Google Assistant on the headphones.  I could control my lights, robot vacuum, and many other household items.  These headphones are amazing.  I tried using them for calls and voice recordings, but the mic on the headphones were really poor, but that is not what I bought them for.  I could charge these headphones with my Macbook charger and the battery life of these headphones were out of this world.  I actually look forward to putting these headphones on because of their quality and comfortability.  This is a great buy if you travel a lot (like if you are constantly on flights), in school, or just for anything really.  These headphones are truly a must buy and I recommend these headphones over any others on the market.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I enjoy bassy music, and if you crank up the Clear Bass setting to +10 it gives you a really solid, tight resounding bass that is about 95% as strong as what the bass-focused XB950N1 produces (and which actually has better bass than the new XB900N which is also bass-focused) with the benefit of having noticeably clearer mids and trebles. It's more comfortable, and it has superior noise reduction. Why then would I rate it only 3 stars? IT IS UNUSABLE WIRED. Despite being able to plug in with the 3.5mm cable and despite keeping it powered on, all equalizer functionality is permanently and forcibly DISABLED while wired. The Clear Bass? Gone. And there's literally no way to turn it back on except to unplug the wire. I use my headset on multiple devices and I want it to sound identical without fidgeting with equalizers, and to be honest even with fidgeting I can't get it to sound quite the same as simply having the Clear Boost at +10. I shouldn't have to fight the headset just because I want to listen on a PC. The old XB950N1 saves the equalizer settings in the headset and keeps them active while plugged in, so why was this functionality removed? Makes no sense. It ruins an otherwise perfect upgrade for me. If Sony was to release an update to allow the EQ settings to operate while plugged in I would gladly change this to a 5-star rating and purchase two sets of headphones (one for my wife and one for me).

Nothing more. Received as a birthday gift in February. I was admittedly disappointed when I got them because I had my heart set on Bose QC. The first listen gave me comfort because the sound on the Sony headset was incredible. I loved the app and being able to customize my listening experience. My happiness was short-lived. Cracks developed in IDENTICAL places above the left and right ear where the adjustment slider moves in and out. The cracks were a problem because they pulled my hair a bit, but not really a deal breaker. Now the adjustment slider is useless and the housing for the wiring is no longer secure. According to Sony, this is not covered under the warranty, but they want me to send pictures. If they replace them, I will update but based on other reviews, I am not hopeful.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_197?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=197&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I do think they're overpriced, but they are the best on the market right now and are the same price as the QC35s by Bose. I find these have better ANC, much better battery, and SIGNIFICANTLY better sound quality.

In terms of comfort, I did a 3 hour test in the house and while my ears sweated profusely, they didn't hurt like they would with the Bose. Doing a 14 hour flight next month, can update again next month. At least I know the battery will last!

I’m a fan of Bose and own many of their items, including their latest Sleep Buds and Sound Bars... etc. When it comes to ANC headphones, I’ve been with them from day 1, owner pretty much everything in their line up. From QC20’s to QC35(I). I never thought i’ll go another way but Sony, with the 1000MX3 did just that.

I skipped upgrading to the QC35(II) because most of the reviews share that ANC and sound did not change much and to be honest, I was perfectly happy with them. In fact, just used them on a 12 hour flight from Singapore to Germany.

However, after reading so many reviews on the Sony, I decided to give it a try. I took around 3 trips to the local Sony store, trying and playing around with it before I decided to buy it. Trying it at the store, I wasn’t really to tell the difference between the Bose. Probably because I wasn’t able to play my music and the demo set wasn’t set up with the Sony Headphones App. Despite of not being able tell a big difference, I decided to take the plunge anyway. This was a risk because in Singapore, returns are not allowed.

After testing the Sony and Bose side by side, at home with plenty of time, I’m happy to say that the MX3 was worth the upgrade.

I won’t go into details here but for me, the main difference is the Sony sounded better and had better ANC. With the EQ off, the Sony already sounded clearer, with more sound stage and the mids and bass are well balanced. After adjusting the EQ with the manual mode, it sounded even better. The bass was noticeably punchier compared to the Bose. As for ANC, my home is pretty quite aside from a bit of air con noise so I can’t say it’s a significant difference but I did notice a slight improvement. I’ll off to a another 12 flight next week so I’m looking to trying it on the plane, will probably bring my QC to compare just for fun.

This is exciting because I’m sure Bose is aware of what the competition is bringing to the table so I’m curious to see what they will launch to regain the throne! If it’s better, I’ll probably switch back to them because I like Bose for many years but till then, I’m my humble opinion, Sony just has a better product as of today.

Thanks for reading!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_196?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=196&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Edit: I have found that this issue is not repeatable when calling through Skype or Whatsapp. When using the built in phone dialer for IOS and Android the issue with the hallway/echo occurs. When using a VOIP service the calls come through crystal clear on both ends.

I received my headphones yesterday and I have been very impressed. The sound quality and noise cancellation is very well done. There is just one issue from making them great. It is impossible to make a phone call through them. It sounds like I am down a hallway when talking.

Unlike Bose QC 35, Sony WH 1000XM3 does not automatically reconnect every time you lose the Bluetooth signal and then return back or when you put the headphones on a charge.

In both instances, you have to open the Windows 10 Settings window to re-connect the headphones as a Bluetooth device AND then connect the device by opening the Control Panel Sound devices and press Connect.

Oftentimes now, upon not using the headphones for a while, the sound gets jittery.

And yes,  have the latest firmware, drivers, Windows updates, and have re-started Windows many times.

There is no direct Sony support email address (another negative point), so I have learned as much as I can from Sony forums and many other sources, but have been unable to solve this issue.

I use Avantree Bluetooth 4.0 dongle.

I regret purchasing these and would never recommend these to a friend.

Sound quality and Noise-canceling is a bit better than Bose QC35's, but for the aforementioned huge negatives, the positives pale in comparison.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_38?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=38&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The sound quality is amazing and the bass isn’t too overwhelming but it’s quite pronounced for an enjoyable experience.

I wanted good sound for classical music. I use it an noisy office environment (lots of people on conference calls). My expectations for the active noise cancellation (ANC) was relatively low. I have an early set of wired ANC headphones and they are okay and I didn't expect much improvement. I was pleasantly surprised. Here are my observations:
1. In the office environment, almost all voice and computer equipment were cancelled out. If I listen carefully, I might hear my cubical neighbor as though his is in a quiet room, far, far away. With quiet classical music, I can't hear him at all.
2. I tired these headphones with my gas powered lawn mower. While I heard the lawn mower over the headphones, it was like it was several houses away in my neighborhood. I could play podcasts on low volume. I was very pleasantly surprised about this.
3. I can hear wind against my headphones. It doesn't prevent me from listening to podcasts, but I was surprised by the amount of wind sound given the headphone performance in other areas.
4. In default mode, the headphones does a good job of adjusting the noise cancellation in my environment. In the office, it did maximum mode. When walking outside, it adjusted so I could hear traffic (important, I was walking on a street without sidewalks). The only issue on automatic adjustment was mowing the lawn. I had to manually set it to maximum noise cancellation.
5. I love that I can cup the right headphone to hear someone talk to me. My only issue is that it turns the volume down instead of pausing the audio. Since I listen to a lot of podcasts, pausing would be a nice feature.
6. While the over-the-ear headphones are very comfortable, my ears are irritated after wearing for 90+ minutes. I have never found headphones that prevented this with my large ears -- but these are the most comfortable I ever tried.
7. The touch controls on the right headphone are okay. It is taking me a while to get used to them, especially the center pause area I find very tricky. I think in a few weeks they will become second nature to me, but it is taking a while.
8. I like the compact carrying case and how the headphones fold-up in it. Nice.
9. I like the wire earphone jack that comes with it. It goes into my PC and bypasses Bluetooth.
10. The phone microphone is only okay. It picks up the ambient noise around me more than like in phone conversations. In Skype calls, I have to be careful to mute my microphone when I am not talking, much more so than my cheap headphones. If I am in a shopping mall, it picks up a lots of the noise around me. Outside phone conversations in windy conditions are nearly impossible.
11. These headphones are not for all circumstances. I will not use them driving. I will not use them in sweaty exercise or workouts. I use AfterShotz Trekz Air in those situations, they don't block my ears and are sweat-proof.
12. I love the 30-hour battery life! -- and with quick charge feature.

Overall, I think these are the best for this kind of headphones on the market. They are expensive, and they are not for every situation. I believe that having several different kinds of headphones for the different situations and environments I'm in. Also, I have purchased through Amazon the 3 year extended warranty -- I have had enough problems with headphones in the past where this is useful. I would not purchase the extended warranty from Best Buy -- it is too expensive now. I think part of the problem is that too many people turn-in their headphones just before the warranty runs out to get the latest headphones. Unless there is a genuine problem with the headphones, I don't think that is ethically right to do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

With new codec technologies like aptx and ldac, audio transmission over Bluetooth is slowly reaching fidelity levels that are comparable to that of a wired connection. That's of course taking into consideration the source and quality of amplification on wired setups. But considering the fact that the trade off in having no cables comes at a sacrifice in sound quality, these Sony's do make that sacrifice a very small and one that is worthwhile.

Traveling with studio gear meant that I have to drown nosies by cranking up the volume which is not a good solution long term as it can potentially damage your hearing. One could argue that IEMs tend to solve that problem and that is true for those that are able to wear them comfortably for long periods of time. Unfortunately that had never been the case for me. My ear canals are rather small and I can only wear the smallest IEMs for less than an hour before itching and irritation occurs. Having custom IEMs built meant I would spend over $1000 for something worthwhile so I ditched them and moved on to cans early down the road.

I owned a pair of Bose quiet comforts for 5+ years and for the longest time they were my only option for noise cancelling. The only other option was the PXC550s that came down the road. I always knew that by taking my Bose with me it meant that I sacrifice sound quality for the sake of noise cancelling as my quiet comforts simply were no match to anything else studio level I listened to such as HD6xx, HD800s (granted both are open back) and the Fostex TH-X00's which are closed backs. I started shopping for an alternative and just as I was getting ready to pull the trigger on the PXC550s I saw the announcement that Sony was planning to release the XM3s. I had shyed away from the XM2s due to the scares of build quality and lack of USB-C support, the same reason I was reluctant to get the PXC500s. I decided to take a chance and get these and honestly I couldn't be any happier.

These headphones do two things very well. One is I find their noise cancelling ability much better than BOSE's. There's an odd feeling with BOSE that I don't get with the XM3s almost like a vacuum sensation. The second is their audio quality is not even comparable to the QCs by BOSE. BOSE's QC2.5 has a very muffled sound. Highs are very subdued, mids are grainy and lows are weak. The XM3s on the other hand provide a balanced but rather veiled sound. I find them a lot more enjoyable to listen to for long periods of time. Mids come off as a bit receded, highs are clear and lows are more refined. No these are not a bassheads dream but they hold their own fairly well for what they are aimed at. They are no match for the soundstage of something like the HD6xx or HD800s but those headphones also aren't closed back or noise cancelling so you are making a huge trade off. The strong noise cancelling more than makes up for that in my opinion. One key note for anyone considering getting these is that you want to be running Android 8.0 with LDAC support. I don't own any Apple devices so I can't speak to that as far as compatibility. But in order to get the most out of the sound codec you want to be running 32bit ~900k 96khz LDAC streaming over Bluetooth.

If you're in the market for Bluetooth noise cancelling headphones that utilize USB-C, these should be an insta-buy. You won't regret the premium investment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This ""dark ally deals"" between Sony and 3rd party resellers are not transparent to their customers and both parties are washing their hands of this sub-par product.  This experience has been very disappointing.  I was a Sony fanboy in the 80s but have not purchased any premium products from Sony in favor of other premium consumer brands.  I was thrilled to give Sony another shot but I now regret my decision to do so.

I wanted to love this product but have to give it a 1 star because of its poor product quality.

I was a Bose QC fan before reading reviews about The Sony WH-1000XM3.  While I was happy with my wired Bose QC 25, I wanted a wireless ANC headphone and decided to buy this headphone 4 months ago.  At first, I was impressed with its audio quality and ANC (Active Noise Cancellation).  After two weeks of use, I started recommending this headphone to my friends and coworkers.  Since I work for a high tech company where the engineers work in an open space environment, my coworkers are always looking for ways to mute the ambient noises so that they can concentrate.  Three people bought this headphone based on my recommendation.  After using this product for four months, I am now regretting my decision to buy this product and for recommending it to others.  The headphone broke after 4 months of normal use, see photos.  I pulled out this headphone at work and learned that the left cup broke away from the headband with no way of reattaching the parts.  I find the hardware quality to be poor, especially for a high-end headphone that costs $350.  I was very disappointed with the product quality and thought that Sony's customer service could remedy the situation.  Similar to the product itself, the customer service experience is equally disappointing.  The service person gave me a web link to upload images of the broken headphone, which I did, and the web site said that Sony will get back to me in 24 hours.  I've not received any acknowledgement of my queries nor responses in 48 hours.  I find the entire experience to be unacceptable for a premium product.

I now need to replace this headphone with another premium wireless ANC headphone but I doubt I will replace it with another Sony product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sound quality was #1 on my focus and wireless was #2 as I liked the freedom that feature brought. Gone are the days of snagging my cord on something and snapping my neck b/c of it. All of the reviews I read pointed me to the Sony WH-1000XM3, so I bought it.

It hurt the heart to fork out $350 but the sound quality and wireless features should pay for itself in no time and as a bonus it has a ""crystal-clear"" mic. Sweet!

I first sync'd headset to my phone (LG G5) after downloading the app. Setup was simple and I was connected fairly quickly. Sound quality was good but it didn't blow my socks off. It's definitely heavy on the bass, which for games and most of my music, is good. The equalizer in the app allows for customization so you could tweak the sound however you like (e.g. turn down the bass).

Next, I connected the headset to my PC (which is where I spend most of my time) via the motherboard's on-board bluetooth connection. I fired up BF4 (and Destiny 2) and again, the sound was okay, but heavy on bass. Since there's no app on my PC, there's no EQ to use to adjust the sound. So that sucked. The touch controls also don't work very well on my PC. When using iTunes, I can turn the volume up and down, but the skip/next song (forward and back) controls don't work. I can hear a beep in the headset which means it recognizes the action, but nothing is happening. *sigh* Remember that ""crystal-clear"" mic, yeah that's a complete lie. It's bloody terrible. It cracks and fades in and out. I could actually hear background conversations better than the person who I was talking to.

The noise-cancellation feature works great! In fact, it's the best thing about this device. You can turn it off completely or have ambient sound on, which makes everything sound ""tinny"" or mechanical, so it's rather useless.

As others have said, the battery doesn't last 30 hours, but that could be due to it needing a break-in period. The cups also make your ears sweat after using them for a few hours. The material on the cups feels kind of thin and I don't think it will last very long even if I baby it. The platic construction helps keep the unit light but I expect that carrying it around for prolong periods will be a source of failure. So all-in-all, I just can't justifying keeping this device AND paying $350, but it's a name brand so of course that's an extra $100.

NeDroid","Can't seamlessly switch between two devices. Otherwise - brilliant","May 9, 2019","These headphones have fantastic noise cancellation, are comfortable to wear, have great sound and a good Android and iOS apps for managing the device. The battery life is fantastic and charging via a USB-C port is fast. I can easily wear them for 1 1/2 days in the office and then quickly recharge during lunch.

I like it very much that it is possible to control how much sound comes from the outside (with an app). This works especially well when having a conversation over a phone or an IM. With simple noise-isolating phones you can't hear your own voice. With Sony phones, you can add a bit of your own voice (but not noise), which make a conversation more comfortable.

A fly in the ointment is that these headphones can't be easily connected to two devices. For example, it took me 5 minutes to connect the phones to iPad (they are usually connected to an Android phone). And then I had to go to the Sony app to help restore connection back to the phone next morning. Bose and Jabra devices do this with ease.

Overall, I like the quality, comfort and ease of use and would recommend these phones to those who don't care about frequent switches between devices.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I wouldn't go as far as others that say they can't hear anything around them or people speaking right near them, but if you have the noise cancelling on and sound at decent volume, it is certainly much harder to hear any outside noises.

I travel on planes a lot and workout even more so I need a headphone that can do both.

These have better sound quality and noise cancellation (plus more advanced optimization) than Bose cq35s.

However, the downfall is that the touch panel glitches on occasion.  The earpad material heats up quickly and gets hot compared to bose. The headband portion gets painful if slightly too tight. My biggest problem is i can't put these around my lower neck. The noise side only turns so your shoulders block the audio and your chin/cheek turn off/pause your music if you move your head with it around your neck.

Overall: better sound/customization than bose. Worse material.

- music listening
- audiobook listening
- digital piano sound isolation
- telephone meetings
They sound great - and bluetooth AAC sounds great from my Apple devices.
They stay connected with a clear signal about 40-ish feet away from the source device

My digital piano is next to the television, so when my wife watches TV - I practice piano.  I needed a headphone that could isolate my piano music from the TV... These do the job better than sound isolating headphones like DirectSound ex29 - which I also own... I *can* hear the TV, it's just so minimized so as to not be a bother.
I use these headphones wired with the digital piano.

The headphones work wired or bluetooth ... and in wired mode, can work passively.
The sound quality suffers radically when they are unpowered - I don't use them that way... I'd consider that an emergency feature, so you'll never be without sound.

They work fine as a telephone headset.  Not great, not bad.  I hear fine, and never have had a complaint about my voice, but I'd say apple AirPods make the person speaking sound clearer. But not bad.

I like that you can adjust the amount and kind of noise cancelation you'd like ... I usually use them with it 100% on, but if you want ambient sound to be let in, you can do that ...

I like the double-tap the right cup to pause/play music

I find the on/off button a bit more difficult to use than the Bose switch... you have to press and hold the button on these - and it's not that easy to find, because there are two buttons... (the other is for the ambient sound mode).

I'd rather have a physical on-off switch rather than a press-to-hold button

The performance of these phones are great - I'm enormously satisfied.

The comfort is better than okay - and worse than great.  I think my Bose QC-15's are a bit more comfortable - not because they are softer, these are similarly soft, but because these get a bit hot.  I thought they got too hot the first couple of times I used them, then I was no longer bothered ... I did buy cloth covers for the pads - (but since I got used to the phones, I stopped using the covers.). So... hot enough that I thought I needed covers, but good enough that I don't use them... if that makes sense.

For those of you that live in the city and experience the occasional snow storm with accompanying loss of power, do you remember the silence that you heard the last time that this happened?  That's what the city sounds like outside of my home when ANC is active.  It's downright eerie.  It won't tune out voices completely, but for steady noises (vacuum cleaners, refrigerators, air compressors, and especially aircraft engines) it works extremely well.  When you're flying, it will make the plane very quiet, but unfortunately it will not tune out that screaming infant behind you.  Fortunately, it will dull said infant enough so that cranking the music a bit will mask things.

Sound quality is good but not great.  The bass is...well, it's not right.  It's over emphasized and there's something else wrong with it.  I don't think that most folks will notice.  If you're listening to podcasts or movies, it's fine.  If you're not used to critically listening on high end gear, it's also fine.  It sounds a bit off to me but it's not like I was offended by it, and again, movies and podcasts are fine.

The user's manual is Ikea-style crap and does not highlight the importance of installing Sony's app in order to get the most out of these.  While the active noise cancelling is great for aircraft, it can be counterproductive around the house when you want to hear what's going on around you.  In its stock mode, the ""ambient noise"" setting (where the headphones amplify outside noises instead of cancelling them out) is crap, but it's actually pretty good if you tune it to your liking in the app.

As you've probably already seen elsewhere on the internet, battery life is fantastic.  They're not kidding with those figures.  These things run for days.

My complaints are that the ear cups are just a hair small for my ears (I have large ears), the manual sucks, and the head phones don't work as well as they should unless you use the app.  The swiping volume control can also be fiddly, but that's normally not an issue for me; you can also control the volume on whatever device is transmitting to the headphones and that's not fiddly at all in my case, so I normally just set my volume on my phone or iPad and ignore this feature.

If you want to listen to stuff while hearing your surroundings, these headphones are great.  If you'd rather not hear your surroundings, they're also great.  When I lent these to my girlfriend, she immediately bought a pair.  I'm not an expert on ANC headphones but I'm extremely happy with these.  4 stars because 4.5 stars is not an option and while my complaints are minor, they're still complaints, and I don't give people five stars if I have something to complain about.

Well done, Sony.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews"

From an audio perspective, the sound without EQ is way too heavy on the bass. With EQ, they are a bit better than the Bose, but not without. Battery life is great and I like the fact that they can be on without needing to play music. I use exclusively at my desk at work but would likely take the Bose when traveling because they feel lighter when walking around and I wouldn’t worry about stuffing them in my bag quite as much.

Theres a free app you can download to play around with some settings and I had to adjust the bass a little because I like TONS of bass.  (I had 2,000 watts going to a single 12-inch subwoofer in my younger days).  The bass is powerful and well integrated, the highs are crystal clear without becoming tinny or piercing, great mids, everything is right where it should be.  I'm definitely no audiophile but this is my first pair of really nice headphones (I have roommates now) and I just cant believe how much better they sound than pretty much every other listening experience I've ever had.

-I live in New York and the weather has been cold this winter. Whenever I'm outside in the cold the headphones react to the cold by registering phantom touches. The cold will make the headphones activate the ""Quick Attention Mode,"" as well as the google voice assistant. This issue is pretty annoying.
-The other issue is that the headphones can make my ears pretty hot. When i wear them for a while in room temperature my ear start to get hot and I'll have to take off the headphones to cool my ears off.
I really like the Active Noise Cancelling and audio quality.

The noise canceling is better than Bose. After listening to songs for 5 hours and I tap the power button to hear the battery percent, the lovely lady voice says ""fully charged"". The battery on this is insanely good.

They are light and yes mostly plastic, but it is plastic I trust to not break easily, assuming you don't sit on them or something.

The case is very high quality and small, it will easily fit in any small bag or backpack.

The sound quality is also very good, better than Bose in my experience. It is heavy bass tuned out of the box but that is easily fixed with the phone app. Once you do that you will have an AMAZING pair of headphones.

Did I mention it uses USB-C and it charges to full charge in like half an hour? That too.

The only bad thing I can think of is a faulty firmware update Sony pushed out right after they released these that made the sound quality and noise cancelling worse, but they have since fixed it. Word of advice, don't update the headphones if they are working fine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I am not an audiophile so I will not say they have warm treble or whatever; I will just say they have very deep bass and they sound fantastic. They are extremely well made, not feeling like some $50 cheapo over-the-ears headphones, which is what these replaced after said my previous cheapo headphones broke three separate times, all in the same way.

The audio canceling abilities of these headphones needs to be heard to be believed. I put these headphones on, play my music or Podcasts, and I can be next to people talking obnoxiously loudly to each other on the subway and I do not hear them. These are great for drowning out yammering on the subway, people at work coughing as if they belong in a tuberculosis ward, and so forth. They also work great as earmuffs, coincidentally enough, due to how tight the fit is in order for the noise cancellation to work.

Above the right ear pad, there is an easily visible red circle with the letter R carved out of it to denote that that is the right headphone. This is a fantastic little detail, proving once again that it's the little things that make up life.

The case they come with is also solidly built and, after some practice, you'll go from taking a few seconds to fold these headphones so they fit to being able to do the folding via muscle memory.

I one complaint and one ""might bother some people"" note. My only complaint about them right now is that the touch controls are *VERY* delicate.

The noise cancelling is a noticeable step up from the QC 35 I currently. It's light (a tad heavier than the Bose), comfortable (I usually can't stand having most headphones on for a long time as my ears tend to get sore - no issues 3 hours in with this pair), and have a sound quality that blows the Bose or any other noise cancelling headphones I've tried out of the water. Being able to cup the right headphone to pause the noise cancelling to listen to people talking to you without taking off the headphone is a pretty cool feature.

Aesthetically, I prefer how the Bose looks, but then again I purchased this for the audio and noise-cancelling properties, not how it looks. The touch controls on the right earpiece took a bit to get used to, but quickly became second nature.

Being able to charge via USB-C is a plus as someone who has a Galaxy S8 and a Nintendo Switch, as I can use the same cable. It also lets you charge the headphones via Quick Charge. While I can't speak to it's longevity, the headphones seem to be high quality, and I don't notice any discernible issue with the headband - something that I understand the previous models suffered from.

Overall, I am extremely impressed by the WH1000XM3, and it will easily become my every day carry headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I purchased the new model for my home office and now I wish I had the same model at my office. I love the new rose gold trim on the headphones, it makes it feel more luxurious.

The new model is significantly lighter than the previous model and I'm very grateful for this. A surprising amount of changes are present in the new model, all of which I am happy with.

The sound quality is amazing and the noise cancellation is top notch for wireless headphones. Can't hear anything else while playing music. The headphones being wireless makes it hassle free.

The charge lasts a fairly long time and it charges back up to full very quickly. Charging is never an issue. If you run out of battery during a session, just plug it in for 10-15 minutes and you'll have plenty of battery life to last you a while longer.

I can't comment on the touch controls because I don't really use them since I typically connect these to my computer and use my computer to control the volume, skip songs, etc.

Great wireless headphones - highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After a week, I'm returning them, since they're just not enough of an upgrade.

Pros:
* The sound quality easily beats Bose. Music sounds more full and there's a much better soundstage.
* Noise cancellation is a noticeable step up from the QC35s. Optimizing for your hair/glasses makes a noticeable difference.

Now, the cons:
* My ears don't touch the inside of the headphones on the QC35s, but do on the XM3s. This ended up being a deal-breaker. I can wear the QC35s all day with minimal breaks, and my ears were hurting after even an hour with the XM3s. Even with the better sound quality of the XM3s, I'd buy the QC35 at the same price just because they fit my ears.
* The controls of the QC35s are just flat-out better than the XM3s'. At their best, the touch controls are finicky, and no match for the buttons on the QC35s. At their worst, if you're wearing them under a jacket in the rain, they'll skip tracks for you and make the headphones unusable. I also have to call out the power button: The switch on the QC35s works perfectly with no fuss every time, and having to switch to holding down a button for three seconds on the XM3s was just an exercise in frustration when I wanted to quickly take them off or put them on.
* This is likely due to the LDAC codec, but I noticed far more interference and skipping while walking around in the streets of NYC. The QC35s pretty much never skipped, but it was a daily occurrence with the XM3s. I expect switching back to SBC would solve this, but that'd negate a big benefit of the XM3s.
* This is a smaller issue, but the earpads on the XM3s don't seem to be replaceable. On the QC35s, replacements take less than ten minutes, and cost $10-20. I've seen enough earpads wear out over a few years that I'm worried about the long-term longevity here. (Although given the sealed non-replaceable battery, longevity was probably never a focus here to begin with.)

And after going back to the QC35s... I don't feel like I'm missing _very much_ from the sound. If you're a serious audiophile and willing to put up with the compromises, this is easily the best sound you'll get from ANC headphones, and also the best ANC out there, but there are definitely tradeoffs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've been searching for a pair for quite a while.  Came across these that were at the top of many review lists, and I agree - these are the best.  In no particular order, here are my findings:
1. They're nicely padded and comfortable and my ears don't get hot or feel pressed even after wearing for a few hours when streaming shows or gaming. the ear cups alone cut down a lot of the external noise.
2. the battery lasts forever and it's great that its rechargeable through a USB-C adapter (which is Super fast at recharging).
3. the sound quality is very impressive.  sure, it isn't body shaking like a home theater is, but it can certainly fill your ears with the whole range, including great bass.
4. the noise canceling is great.  it immediately sounds like you've stepped into one of those sensory deprivation rooms.  Of course you'll still hear the occasional loud noise or if you're next to someone trying to talk to someone you can hear them but it is very reduced.  keep in mind you wont hear someone calling you from the other room.
5. the controls are actually really good and useful. I thought they'd be a gimmick with the touch pad gesture controls, but they are well thought out and executed well.  the menu voice telling you system status, battery life, etc, is also very nice to have and works well.  The bluetooth connection works seamlessly too.
6. And one of the key points that made me choose this one, that I haven't seen in a lot of other noise canceling headphones, is that these will still work as regular headphones even if you don't have to have them powered on (no noise canceling or controls of course) as long as you have them wired up to your device.
7. the choice of colors-black or white is nice, and the case that they come in is also quality.

I'm not a big Sony fan and thought I'd end up with a Bose or Sennheiser set, but I'm very happy I chose these headphones, these are the best - quality, performance, and value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It is the best over the ear NC BT headphone I've tried. But boy does it come with a lot of complaints.

The Good
1. Very comfortable. Sweat might be a problem in the summer. But bigger/deeper than XM2, XM2 gets uncomfortable after an hour or 2. I can wear the XM3 for 4+ hrs no problem.
2. Sound quality is great for bluetooth. The Sennheiser PXC and Bose QC35 ii I've tried can best be described as lifeless no matter how I tweak the EQ. The XM3 is too bass forward by default but with some eq it shows a lot of dynamic range and the soundstage is much bigger than the other 2 listed here.
3. Noise canceling is excellent, a bit better than QC35. Allows me to listen to music at lower volume and pick up more details.
4. USB-C: Thank you, microusb shouldn't be used on non budget devices in 2018

The Bad
1. The build quality: The comfort and flexibility is great but man this feels cheap. Plastic squeaks with movement sometimes. Very plastic heavy all around.
2. The non replaceability: The ear pads and headband pads aren't designed to be replaced. While the material suggest that they should be able to be wiped clean, I'd still appreciate some modularity in case they get flat/dirty in the future.
3. Lack of multiple BT connection: It's 2018, cheaper headphones supports 2 BT devices to be connected at the same time for a while now and with these Sonys I still have to disconnect/connect between my PC/Phone every time I need to make a switch.
4. The touch control: Cool in concept, works reasonably ok in non windy situations. But man it cause problems in the winter when it would erroneously register all sort of command (Google assistant, the ""hear the surrounding"" command, skip forward, skip back). Every time I go outside in near freezing weather I have to reset it by turning it off, wait a bit until headphone get used to surrounding temperature, and then turn it back on. Same thing for when I go inside. Even then it has false registrations. I wish there is a way in the app to turn off certain functions that I rarely use (the cup ear thing comes to mind) so they wouldn't mistakenly get registered. But I currently do not see that function.

But at the end of the day there are compromises for all BT headphones now. And if you have the money and the pros here line up with your priority, this is still a decent buy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_198?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=198&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I had narrowed it down to the Bose QC35 II's and the Sony WHX1000XM3's.  After doing a lot of research I settled on the Sony's because of the reported flexibility of the app and equalizer, the touch controls, sound quality, and the USB-C charger.

I have been using these regularly for a month and am very happy with my purchase.  The noise cancellation is amazing.  The sound quality is very good.  I was worried since the reviews mentioned the bass was more pronounced with the Sony's than that of the Bose, but I found that it was not overpowering.  The battery life is really good as well, and the touch controls work just as advertised.

It did take a while to get used to them since I used mainly in ear bluetooth buds for many years, but they are really comfortable, and I am able to wear them for hours without ear fatigue.

I definitely recommend these headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_45?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=45&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I purchased these headphones with the intention of cutting background audio sounds like fans, clicking of keyboards etc. (or at least assisting with them). They do a relatively decent job. The sound quality on these headphones are pretty decent as well. Not bad for listening to music with more bass. There are two problems with these headphones in my eyes... the microphones and accessories. I know the product is purely made for ""noise cancellation"" and the focus is not with accessories, but you have GOT to be kidding me. After spending this much money on a headset they send you a cable to charge your headset SO SHORT that it can't reach anything without putting strain on the adapter you use or the USB-C jack. I honestly think the cable is ~6 inches. Also, do not anticipate using these headphones for a phone call... seriously.

For this I say mission accomplished. The noise canceling is great. Just putting them on instantly blocks a lot of the surrounding noise and with the noise canceling turned on it is blissfully quiet. Wearing the headphones for long times while watching a movie they stay comfortable and never hurt my ears but somehow the headband is causing a pinching pain on top of my head.

Contacted sony about returning the product, sent it to them, they offered a replacement,  and then they put in the wrong address on the package so now the replacement is sitting in a FedEx facility 20 minutes away from me but they won't let me even go out of my way to pick up the headphones (because that's not company policy).

They need to contact a ""shipping team"" different from their ""support team"" to help me. The shipping team can't be called, but they must be summoned like batman, by shining a giant light into the sky, and only then can they look into the case. But don't worry, that's only if your case gets expadited. They've sent me to beurocratic hell and they keep adding fuel to the fire.

The big flaw for me is phone calls.  Everyone complains and tells me to call them back without the headset.  I didn't expect this at all given my less expensive Bose never had a problem.
1) Has there been any software updates to deal with this?  If not is any in the works?
2) When I receive calls noise cancelling automatically turns off and I hear amplified ambient noise.  Is there a way to
keep noise cancelling on ALL the time?

 I don't want to resort to using a cable as it defeats the whole purpose of this headset.  Any solutions appreciated.
Some have exchanged their XM3's for another pair and phone calls improved a little but still not great.

Highly recommend","November 10, 2019","This is an excellent pair of headphones. I was blown away by the noise cancellation and the phenomenal sound quality. I was deciding between the Bose QC35 II and these and while the Bose is a great product too, this is just far more superior in terms of noise canceling (well, just by a smidge though, very tiny difference if you really want to notice it) and Sound (this is just more fun to listen with more bass and more details and sound separation compared to the Bose ). I’ve been re listening to my favorite tracks and it’s so much more enjoyable with these headphones.. really glad I got these.

One gripe I have, actually 2- it’s difficult to make phone calls with these in windy or noisy environments since people on the other end have complained about too much background noise, and second- switching between devices is not smooth, sometimes you have to disconnect Bluetooth from the 1st Device before connecting the 2nd one. This makes it a laborious task. Bose is better for these 2 aspects.

But do get these if all you are looking for are great sound quality and excellent noise cancellation.

The build quality, the sound, the ANC functionality, all top notch (as they should be for the price). However, I can't remember the last time I had such a poor experience switching between bluetooth devices. The instructions say you can pair up to 8 (i think) devices, but that doesn't mean you can quickly switch between them. Really wanted to listen to music and take calls on my PC, yet if I got a call on my cell, be able to answer it with the headphones, as i can do on any number of bluetooth headsets, including a several year old set of QY7 earbuds. they switch seamlessly, yet the experience with these was horrible, I returned them.

After looking and looking, reading reviews and ratings, I decided to take the plunge on these. Suffering from hearing loss makes me have to wear hearing aids on both ears, which helps but brings in some background noise. Traveling in planes is the worst! You need the hearing aids to hear the announcements and flight attendants, but even the top of the line hearing aids allow some airplane noise. I'm taking them on and off. It's also super annoying to hear the talk of other people, the coughs, babies crying.......and the hum of the engines.

Well, I thought I would tr;y these and put them on in the plane. I could not hear ANY of those sounds! I was in my own quiet, peaceful world. These blocked out so many sounds that the flight attendant would have to tap my arm to get my attention. NOISE CANCELLING IS GREAT. That said, it might be a different experience for a person without hearing loss.

Then I turned them on and the sound was stunning. Just beautiful. You can use this with or without the cord so you can plug it right into the seat back screen. The charge lasted all day long until I put them away. The charging cord is a little short but fine.  Nice adjustable comfort, felt quite luxurious.

Worth every penny!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The ANC toggle has 3 modes and talks to you for a long time before switching modes, which was slightly annoying.

The ability to control volume and pause content with just a swipe or double tap is great. Noise cancellation is wonderful, and sound is really good; plus you can adjust to your liking with equalizer via app. My only suggestion is that they make the headband a little wider (front to back) to help distribute the load a bit; while wearing for long periods of time I would have to adjust it occasionally to prevent minor pain. I also haven’t found any need for the other two audio options (ambient sound on, and noise canceling off).

The mix is heavily tilted toward the bass with the mids and highs very muted. Still trying to decide if the noise cancellation is worth it over the sonic properties of my etymotic ear buds which, though not active, do a great job of blocking noise.

Edit: I am revising this down to a 2 star review. These deserve 2 stars for the noise cancellation, but if you care about sound quality at all do not buy these. Even though the mix is tilted toward bass, if you listen to anything with heavy bass the sound is muddy as hell.

Sure, they sound great and are great at noise cancellation, but the usability is poor. If you connect these to more than one device at any point in time, then good luck getting music to play from one of them when you want it to. I connected to my phone first, and all was well. I then connected to my laptop yesterday and work. When I got home and was cooking I wanted to listen to music on my headphones so I did not bother my husband, but after 30 minutes spent messing with my phone and headphones, I could not get spotify to play. I reconnected and disconnected over bluetooth. I turned the headphones off and on. I went into the app to see if I could change the primary device, like you can in the Bose QC app, but I ultimately couldn't get them to work. That to me is the downfall of these headphones. I need to be able to switch between different devices - I am not even saying I need to be able to switch easily, like I could with my Bose, but just being able to switch at all would be nice. I also do not like the volume/pause/play/skip controls on these headphones. I rested my head on my shoulder and my music started playing directly from my phone two days ago when that connection was working. Bizarre.

Koenig","Don't assume you'll get silence","March 19, 2019","I got these headphones for airplanes, and because they definitely improve the plane noise I decided to keep them - my first pair of headphones. I bought these - relatively expensive - having heard all the raves about the ""noise-cancelling."" Perhaps I was naive, but I expected that I wouldn't be able to hear conversations around me, flight announcements, etc. I can hear all that, plus some engine noise, but certainly it's much more pleasant than without them. Also, easier by far to hear movies than with simple earbuds.
You might be able to get something acceptable for a lot less money.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was looking for a good pair of headphones I could travel with, mostly on airplanes (3-4times a month) wanted something with great sound, noise cancelling, Bluetooth AND wired, great battery life, comfortable and can pack up small to fit in my backpack. These checked ALL boxes! I did a lot of research and the only headphones that came close in comparison were a pair of Bose QC35. The noise cancelling is awesome and works wired or wireless,you something I've seen not be the case in some other headphones. You can also change the level of noise cancelling, allowing some ambient noise in so you know your surroundings, as well as cut out completely and have wind cancellation. They also fit great around the ears very comfortably so you can get hours with them (battery life is amazing!). This also seals out the noise. My favorite part about these that i don't believe the Bose have is NFC. Didn't even know this was a feature I wanted until I got to use it. I just tap my Android to my headphones and they connect or disconnect. This makes pairing and switching to multiple devices the fastest I've ever tried! Only one thing I'm not a huge fan of is touch buttons. I never like touch buttons because they tend to cause problems due to the sensors. I haven't has problems yet but I've heard of others that do. I've also used them for oyone calls and haven't yet to have complaints. Haven't done a ton with phone calls yet though.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The good:
Very comfy around the ear, noise-cancel worked great, and the talk -thru feature was good.

The bad:
Design.
The buttons for control are on the bottom of the left side and kept bumping against my shoulder and turning off the noise-cancelling feature.

Functionality.
They would randomly just stop cancelling noise, though they were charged, and it wasn’t due to them turning off by accidentally hitting the button on my shoulder. I could tell when the charge was low and I had to charge them, vs random turning-off every hour or so. Very annoying.
No idea why that kept happening.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I did like them a lot. Very good sound, excellent noise cancellation, but not the most comfortable. I started to watch a lot of reviews of the WH1000Ms on youtube and decided to exchange my M2 for the M3. Yes!! Wow! Super comfortable! Even better Noice Cancellation. But the sound quality? In my opinion a very big upgrade! Fantastic sound quality! Much better than the M2. Maybe just a tad bass heavy, but I adjust that on my Galaxy S9+ equalizer. When you connect with the Sony LDAC lossless codec, you are not able to use the Sony apps build in equalizer. I prefer to use LDAC instead of the standard SBC codec since it is totally uncompressed. I listen a lot to classical music, and in my opinion, the M3 offers for me at least, a very very decent soundstage! I could not be more impressed. Best headphones I have ever had!

The right channel would produce a loud humming noise when I moved my head around. I found out through experimentation that this is because of a feedback loop that is created because the interior microphone is presented with too much of the outside noise when a perfect seal is broken. Clearly it's not supposed to do this (as the left channel didn't). When I contacted the customer support at Sony they provided me with the most useless links and didn't even try to understand what the issue was and offered to help or replacements at all. I had to return this pair.
All this said, when the earphones worked they were great. Nice quality sound, excellent connection, and even the microphones had a pretty good quality for phone calls (this is a major upgrade from the previous generation).
If it wasn't for the terrible customer service, in fact, I would give this a 5 star since I think the noise cancellation is better than anything else I've tried (and I've almost tried them all).","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The controls and automatic adjustments designed into the headphones make it  very easy and functional for anyone to use. The comfort is also great as they cover the ears without putting pressure onto the ears but around them allowing for a tight secure fit. Overall the design is comfortable, functional, and looks good. My only complaint is the loudness of the volume and impact of the base, I often compare headphone to the first generation of Beats by Dre as they would blow  your head off. The base and volume were truly amazing, they were like walking around with a boom box. I believe this Is controlled due to Europes regulation for how loud headphones can be. Other than that these headphones are a good buy. I am going to return them as they do not fulfill my requirements in term  of volume level and base, if you are going to buy them, do not buy them for the normal $350.

However I did go to a brick and mortar store to buy these once I got my refund and let me tell ya,

It's probably not worth the upgrade. I feel like I should have kept those XM2s because they had better sound quality. Super disappointed. But you know...

Oh well... They're superior to the others of their class, Bose wasn't so great for me and didn't really hit the mark for me and these definitely blow Bose out of the park.

Design and feel wise, Sony Really stepped up their game again and made an honestly ""sexy"" pair of headphones. They're soft, they're comfortable, the materials are very premium feeling and the case is absolutely stunning.

Good job, Sony.

I think that may be I need more time to let these guys break in, but I keep hearing what sounds like, a ""blown speaker"" kinda sound so ... Maybe it needs more time of mid volume play before I hit hard with bass or play with the different sound stages.

I'll let you guys know how that goes. Grab the XM2s for now. Not these.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Comfort level is maybe a tad below the QC35 when worn for hours on end, but the ability to use noise cancellation when wired is a winner since that is how I use it, having an LG V20 with a quad DAC. It's a little annoying that the signal processing features Sony has included in the app (even EQ) can only be used while connected to Bluetooth as opposed to being set while on Bluetooth and used when wired, but this is still a relatively minor gripe with an otherwise excellent pair of headphones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's premium in everything - the app could get a little bit better, but the overall features and benefits of it are as crisp as it can be.  Sound quality and noise cancellation are on point. I'm not sure how much better it can get from this, maybe even more noise cancellation?  I was trying to find something I didn't like about this and couldn't. Comparing to my Bose, the M3 is superior in every aspect. Maybe the only thing is the Bose QC35 II is a little bit lighter and more comfortable in long hours of use. I could see the M3 being a little tiring after a long use, which for me is not a problem since I don't listen to anything longer than 2 hours anyway. My experience so far has bee incredible. I love my Bose and I will be using it to go to the gym, grocery store and such, but when I am traveling or want to enjoy the music a little deeper, the M3 is definitely my go to headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Relatively comfortable, noise cancellation is nice, sound quality is passable for bluetooth, but their construction is relatively fragile and not something I would count on lasting past a year.  USB-C is their biggest differentiating factor, but that's more of a convenience thing.

Now back to the title of this review. You can't take phone calls on these. You sound like a literal robot. I don't know what kind of useless microphone they outsourced for these, but it sure doesn't belong in a $350 headset.

Are these worth the money even without the microphone issues? Probably not unless money's a complete non-factor for you. But if you planned on making phone calls, do not buy.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I recently spent a substantial amount replacing my AV system into cutting edge technology. However I don’t have a sound room so at times I respect others in the household and use these headphones.

But worth every penny.","December 8, 2018","Let me first start off by saying that this this is my 1st pair of high end noise cancelling headphones.
If you're riding the line of ""is it worth it to buy these.. they're $350"" then the answer is probably yes, and i'll explain why.

1.) Sound quality: the sound quality is beyond phenomenal. Even at low volume, you can hear all sound ranges really well with these. With the use of the  free Sony headphones app, you can not only alter the bass as desired, but also tailor the specific frequency ranges either manually or through presets such as ""bright, excited, jazz.."" etc. These seriously thump when you turn up the bass- another reviewer was right when they said it feels like it rattles your skull haha.

2.) Build quality: the plastic parts and hinges seem sturdy, and the earcups are very soft leather that do not cause pressure points. Though these are allegedly the heaviest out of its competitors (QC35), you'll likely find that they're so comfy that you may forget that you're wearing them. These new XM3's feature a USB C changing system that are very quick charging. The battery isn't a slouch either- the battery lasts around 30 hours between charges, depending on whether you're using NC or not.

3.) Features: as advertised, the pause, skip forward/backward, palm gesture, and more are all very responsive and useful. The noise cancelling in phenomenal; it even has the ability to ""calibrate"" to your particular face, ears, hair, and glasses. The app lets you control how much noise cancelling you want. For example, on ambient (or adaptive) sound 20, I can practically hear everything as if I were not wearing the headphones at all. At ambient sound 0, it blocks around 98% of the sound and you'd really need to focus to try to hear any sounds that make it through. When you have music playing at any volume, I'd venture to say that the noice cancelling blocks virtually 100% of outside noises- be it HVAC, airplane engines, annoying conversations, blaring TV's, and so on.

Hope this helps! If not, there are plentiful reviews on youtube concerning these and its precursors (xm2) in comparison to the Bose QC35","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Your sound will sound muffled and low.

I am surprised why 99% of the Youtube reviews never mention this? It is quite disappointing since this is obvious for anyone using them for more than 5 minutes.

Did all the updates but still the same. I have returned them to Amazon (which I have to say were very helpful) and will consider buying either the Bose or the new Jabra Elite 85h when they arrive in April and if they get a good review.

Build quality seemed good but I was also not impressed by the sound quality of music and the fit (but that of course varies)

I have 10ish pairs of nice headphones. From Klipsche in-ears, to Bose QC 35ii, Nuraphones, AKG open mixing cans, Airpods, Sennheiser HD4.50 and a few others - and the these Sony's are still my go-to for daily listening. First off, they are well-built, Light, and very comfortable. I am prone to headphone fatigue, which is the #1 reason I have abandoned really enjoyable headphones like the Nuraphones. Next, the battery life is killer, 25+ hours with ANC on. Next the ANC is hands down the best out there, if you do you homework this will be abundantly clear. Bluetooth 4.2 is great for the average use case, though it's a bummer these don't have 5.0, which gives a bit more range and codec options. Next, and probably most important is sound. I will admit, these headphones arent honest. There is an emphasis on bass, and certain things can sound muddy with the out of the box settings. However, with the app, or any music app with a decent EQ (yes, this includes spotify), you can tweak them to your liking and get a much more balanced sound signature. Personally, when I put these on after the Bose QC35, or the Sennheiser HD4.5, the bass heavy EQ is most striking. But if I just throw these on without listening to a brighter EQ before, its not off-putting. These are by no means Beats, which are basically nothing but low quality bass, but they are noticeably less bright than most.
Bottom Line: If you are looking for great every day over ear ANC headphones in the $300-$350, these are infinitively the right choice. If you care about nothing but a flat EQ in a similar setup, you can go with Bose (but you can still EQ these to get close). If you want soundstage and honest profile, get some wired AKGs. But I will reiterate, these are the best over ear BT ANC headphones in this price range today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_50?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=50&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They came fully charged, but ever since I got them they wouldn't charge. I initially tried to use the provided cable to a PC and no luck, the percentage kept going down. I tried using my phone adapter , changed cables around and everything. The battery just arrived defective. I immediately ordered a replacement, but since they're out of stock, now I need to wait another month or two (or three) for them to restock, and that's just frustrating.... plus, honestly I would expect more from a Sony flagship product that sells for 350$.
Other than that, they simply cannot handle using multiple devices. When I'm at work it's really frustrating because I connect them to my laptop, and whenever I have a phone call or need to leave my laptop, I need to disconnect my laptop from it and connect my phone, and the process takes time.
All in all, I expected a lot but was unfortunately let down by a very negative experience.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_179?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=179&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Noise cancelling is extremely good for deeper background noises. At the gym, I can just about barely hear the vocals from music playing on the speakers but none of the background music. With my own music playing at low volume, outside noise is almost unnoticable.
The touchpad controls are very intuitive and work as expected 98% of the time.

Where it fails, and the reason I had to return it is the fit. The top of the head rests on my head and it is uncomfortable. So as a fix, I thought I would lengthen /extend the earphone part to make space for my head and the top of the headphone but it didn’t work. The headphone just dropped down and still resting on my head. I gave it several days but it was the same.  My husband has the Bose quiet comfort 35 ii and I have used it in occasion without a problem.

I use these headphones with my LG V40 phone which has an excellent Quad DAC and the wired sound thru these headphones rivals my $800 headphones.  The sound provides has clear and slightly rounded treble, excellent  midrange and warm bass.  The app controls allows the sound to be dialed in to personal preference which I found to work well.  These headphones are very efficient and work well with the power button off providing adequate volume from the V40 at 50% output.  Sound is better wired but the Blue Tooth sound is as good as I have heard and provides all the additional features that put these over the top and I have tried many competitors.  The different noise canceling modes are easy to change and work well and they are comfortable and provide very good isolation.  Unlike some others have experienced and perhaps because of my phone, I found the call quality to be very good.  I love the feature of putting your right hand over the right control to mute the sound and immediately hear outside conversation, this is great during flights.  I found the touch controls on the right side to work very well.  As evident, I highly recommend these Sony WH1000XM3 Bluetooth headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_26?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=26&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I am so happy to say that I just got off a 9 hour flight with my new WH1000XM3 and I didnt have to take them off even once.  The pain is gone!!  I believe its because the ear cups are bigger and the headband is more evenly distributing the weight.  Sound is amazing!!

I dont know why another review was saying that voices are not cancelled bc on my flight I was in my own world for 9 hours and didnt even hear announcements from the captain/crew bc the noice cancellation is so effective.

Finally the comfort of the Bose QCII with the powerful Sony Noice Cancellation; it doesnt get any better than the WH1000XM3!!

Rao","Arguably the best noise cancelling headphones out there","March 22, 2019","These are the best headphones I’ve owned and quite possibly the most well engineered piece of tech I’ve ever used.
The sound palette is virtually infinite, able to simultaneously capture the lilt of a violin in a waltz to the crashing climax of a 60s rock solo.
The touch controls work excellently and OTA software updates via Bluetooth are an excellent idea and work very well too.
I debated for a week whether to buy the Bose QC35 ii or this set, and it was a meaningless debate. The Sonys dominate.

All this is before you queue up a movie. You’ll hear nuances and sound you’ve never heard in a 10 viewings of a movie to the point where the sound almost engages more than the visuals.

There’s no question, there’s no comparison, there’s no equal to these. Buy them with your eyes closed.

I was in between these and the Bose QuietComfort 35s. I went to Best Buy and tried both pairs on to see what I preferred. Between what I felt comfort wise and what one of the assistants also told me there I decided to purchase these headphones through Amazon since they were having a summer sale. I have no regretted my decision they are extremely comfortable and sound terrific. The noise cancelling is perfect for traveling as it helps to block out all surrounding noises. I would recommend these to anyone who spends lots of time on planes. As well as anyone else currently in the market for a fantastic set of headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews"

(These were wired)

My son had a pair of the over ear Beats which also sounded good but not as good as the Soul did (also wired)

I was in an airport a few months back and bought the Bose QC35 II's, and they were very nice but didn't go as loud as I would have liked them too.  I gave them to my wife and trusted CNET and other reviews stating Sony had outdone themselves on the Gen 3 of these headphones.

First, I do not wear them everyday, I take them when I am traveling and randomly use them if I need to tune everything out to get work done.  The noise canceling on these is amazing.  My keyboard clicks very loudly and with these on I cannot hear it at all.  They have 3 settings, noise canceling, ambient, and no ambient.  The noise canceling is truly the best I have ever tried from the Soul's to the Beats to the QC35 II's.  Handsdown amazing noise canceling.  As for the ambient setting, it is nice as is slightly amplifies the ambient noise around you so you can hear without the headphone muffling the noise.  And when they are in no ambient the software isn't running and they act like standard over ear headphones that would somewhat muffle sound.

The features are quite cool.  I read in someone's review that when outside in the cold the touch interface has issues, but I am not wearing them out in the cold so that is not something that would affect the performance for my usage.  The right ear exterior is the touch interface with simple intuitive gestures to make it play, pause, volume up or down, skip tracks forward and backward, and my favorite feature hold your hand over the right ear and they recognize that you need to speak with someone and they switch from active noise canceling to the ambient boost setting so you can talk without shouting or taking them off.  Quite ingenious when you think about it, especially if you use them frequently on planes.

All in all, I own playstations (3 and 4) but have rather thought of Sony as an afterthought when it comes to high level electronics in today's market.  However, these headphones earn their top choice editor's pick status hands down.  I trust a lot of the reviews on CNET and other reputable tech sites, and can say that if you are looking for a great pair of bluetooth over ear noise canceling headphones, then look at these, as I think they are the best.  I have an iPhone XS and they paired quickly and the Sony app allows you to actively adjust the sound without using the Apple EQ which is nice since a lot of the reviews state they are too bass heavy, a quick adjustment fixes that.  They also come with a nice case very similar to the one my Bose QC35 II's came in, but seems slightly thinner, which is nice.

I listen to a lot of different music from hip hop to punk rock and most things in between and they sound great with everything I have tried them with.  I don't think you will go wrong with these if this is the type and style of headphone you are looking for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The headphones volume seems to be completely out if sync with my phones vollune. Playing way louder than it should proportionally at all levels. What’s weird is that even if I turn the vollume all the way down and it says muted I can still hear my music. Maybe the headphones are so loud that the “muted” (apperently no, apple) is perceivable. Either way, if you use the bad volume control on the side it can eventually hit useable volume levels. It even does this weird incremental volume adjustment, so I can’t even use the displayed volume meter as a representative gage. Basically I can’t EVER adjust vollume using my phone on these things

However, the fact it tracks your location at all times, for a function that terrible and misleading, is grotesque. One can theoretically turn this off, but it seems in setting up “personal optimizing” it grabs your location anyway so they seem to not care

Update: volume for what ever reasons seems to be slowly getting in sync with my phone controls, which is good!","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_35?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=35&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I actually purchase both the Sony WH-1000 XM3 and the new Boss NC700, and I have to say maybe teh Boss NC700'
s new aesthetic and headband design looks more sleek and modern, but when I wear it over an extended period of time, the pressure will build up and I feel my ear and the area above of my ear are getting fatigue feeling.  Normally, if I don't own the previous Bose headphone or I don't have the Sony XM3 for comparison, I might look over this, but....the Sony XM3 just feel so comfortable and so right when it fits on to my head and ear.  It might look in odd shape when you not wearing it, but it sure makes you feel good and able to wear over an extensive period of time.

The sound is great for wireless NC headphone at this price point, and the noise cancellation is just superb...  Unlike Bose and most other NC headphone that allows the user to adjust the level of NC, Sony XM3 will base on your preference or occasion of use, and listening environment to auto adjust the degree and condition of the NC.  I have not tested out in all different situation and environment yet, but the result of listening with the Sony at indoor office, while driving and riding a bike are all excellent.

Also, there are tons of features like sound position, preset or customize EQ, environment effect, etc... which I have not tried all yet, but it is already way better than most other NC wireless headphone's app.

If you are looking for top-grade NC wireless headphone that is turley bang on the buck, this is the one!.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_40?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=40&reviewerType=all_reviews"

With that said the noise cancelling is really good, better than Bose in my opinion.  but the touch controls are trash.  even without gloves it takes me 4 or 5 times to skip a song sometimes.  why would people want or care about touch controls on headphones is beyond me.

Note that in wired mode, while turned off/charging (ie. passive mode), the sound quality is pretty bad! Also, they let you listen to them while charging, but they give you a 6"" charging cable... thanks Sony.

The Bose are a little more comfortable, about half the weight as these, and I could wear them all day, but I need a break with these after a couple of hours here and there. These stick out from the head more than the Bose. I could sleep with the Bose on cause they were flatter, but not so much with these. They also fall off a little easier than the Bose.

The noise cancelling in these is about the same as the Bose (I did a side-by-side comparison), but the Bose put you in more a vacuum/isolated environment, which is sometimes preferable.

The bluetooth connection in these is a little better than the Bose, doesn't really skip much (sometimes does even when Bluetooth device is close), whereas the Bose seemed to skip a little more whenever there was some interference or strong brain waves. Also it should be known that these will only connect to one device at a time, and when doing so (switching devices), sometimes you have to power them on and off and reconnect, as it will say connected, but audio won't actually play through them, which is a small annoyance, whereas the Bose didn't do this, and could connect to multiple devices at a time, and could use a custom device name.

The touch controls on these are cool, but also not perfect (ie. changing volume might accidentally change song, vice versa, or won't respond and have to try twice, not common but it happens), and also with a slight response delay. Sometimes I feel like I would prefer haptic/buttons more. Also, when powering on or off, you have to hold the power button for a full 3 seconds or so. I don't know why they couldn't make it a little shorter. Just being picky there. The Bose turn on and off right away with a switch.

Overall they're nice headphones, maybe only worth about $250 imho. I would probably return them and go back to the Bose if the Bose didn't have it's known Bluetooth issues, and supported hi-fi bluetooth streaming like these do.

I should also add... if you run these in the highest-quality mode (ie. 990kbps), it will interfere with your wifi! Even on your phone, you'll notice the wifi become very much interfered with when using the phone while wearing the headphones. If you drop the quality down to 660kbps, it doesn't really affect it so much (330kbps is the lowest setting).

Update with WH-H900N h.Ear 2:
I recently sent the XM3's back and bought the WH-H900N h.ear 2 model, as I found them for much cheaper on eBay and the features are nearly identical. The WH-H900N is about the same as the WH-1000XM3, in all aspects (including high-quality streaming and touch controls), with these differences:
-The 900N's are a little tighter around the head, but can wear them about the same length of time as the XM3's.
-The 900N's noise cancelling and isolation is just as good as the XM3's, sufficient enough and well worth the price I paid for them.
-The 900N's touch-sensitive controls are more responsive, and react immediately when you touch them. Surprisingly, the XM3's are less so, with a slight delay, so I prefer the 900N's in this regard.
-The 900N's quick charge (10 mins) only gives you about an hour, while the XM3's give you 5 hours in 10 minutes.

Hope it helps.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Then compare them side by side to the WH1000xm2. I will list the advantage this has over the m2 then finding out if you need to upgrade to help with your purchase decision. I use the Sony pretty religiously so no nitpicking here.

1. Sound quality: The Wh1000xm3 sound better than the wh1000xm2 for obvious reason but not blow out the water better. You hear more separation in your music. Also if you ever use the surround modes (dont hate me for this mx2 owners) but there is a very faint but slightly annoying static that occurs when you use the surround modes. Especially on arena mode. The wh1000xm3 erased this totally and that static is no longer there. This may be a big reason of Sony adding the QN1 chip as the wh1000xm2 may have tried to process the music and noise cancelling but since there was no medium, both went throughthe same channels which causes static that you hear. It made my listening experience far more enjoyable.

2. Noise cancelling: Noise cancelling is not noise proof. It does block out more sound than its predecessor however with noise cancelling I felt that the m2 cancelled more sound. Although with noise cancelling on, the m3 do a much better job. I no longer had to put music up to 50 percent to block out sound from very moist environments. Just 20-25 does the trick. Although by itself it already cancels noise out exceptionally better.
Now to clarify the reason the reason why noise cancelling headphones have a hard time cancelling voices. It's really because your voice is not a constant sound wave. It constantly oscillates and to produce counter sound waves to that requires a lot. Despite this, these are the best noise cancelling headphones on the market right now. Now are they 4x better in noise cancelling? I would say 40%better but not 4x which seems like a stretch. But getting rid of the static may have been something.

Build quality: To cut down on costs since you already have the QN1 chip and for a smoother design. Sony added the plastic over the brush aluminum. Also to appeal to their female market as well, they tried to make headphones that appealedto both genders. If you notice, not many girls really wanted to try the wh1000xm2. I did a test of and I got a positive response for men about wearing the wh1000xm2 about 82% while only 18%of females really wanted to try the wh1000xm2. However for the xm3 with the same even 100 amount. I got a higher positive response from females about 42% to 56% men. Plus the lighter xm3 adds to longer hours of listening. The wh1000xm3 is still built well, although you had a leather cup to create a better noise cancelling seal. The wh1000xm3 does not need that so it can afford a sleek appearance. Plus it cuts down on the weight. There is added padding at the top of the wh1000xm3 so when you bump your head, you are protected from most of the shock whereas with the m2 they get scratched at the top fairly easily.

USB: USB-C instead of micro is a vast improvement. Do keep in mind your charger is also a prominent factor on how well it stays. I recommend using anker products for their cables and wall charger. The Sony cable is pretty short. The audio cable us really not THAT bad and it seems most people are overreacting about this and I'm not sure why.

Case: the case is definitely sturdier and has more room inside. Although I do miss the snap on and snap off case of the m2.

What I pointed out where key points as most other things can be looked up on the Sony page and reading the features of the headphones. Although please note neither have multipoint connecting abilities. Although this never bothered as my phone my main source so that's never bothered me.

But is it worth the upgrade? If it really isnt in your budget, I would sell your XM2 first then get the XM3. If the xm2 has been working well for you then you are fine. Save yourself another $350. If it is in your budget just measure against other items you could get, if this is it, go for it. I can say you will not be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Better than earmuffs. Mic is defective.","November 12, 2018","These headphones have great active noise canceling for blocking low to mid-range frequencies. The passive noise canceling (insulation) works OK for blocking the higher frequencies. Before getting these headphones I used to study while wearing industrial-grade NRR 33 earmuffs. Those were a bit better at blocking high and mid-range frequencies, and they only cost like $20, but they were much worse at blocking the low frequencies and a bit less comfortable. I prefer these headphones and I've started wearing them all the time.

My only issue with them is that the microphone doesn't work for phone calls. Other people say it sounds like I'm calling from inside a tin can. I thought maybe updating the firmware to version 2.0 would help but it didn't. Many other people seem to be reporting the same problem.

Update (Nov 14, 2018): I talked to Sony support and they basically confirmed that the microphones are defective for many of the WH-1000XM3 headphones. Supposedly they've fixed the production problem now, but they are still selling the defective units through Amazon. If you receive a defective unit, they are willing to exchange it. That's kind of a hassle though, so I'd suggest that if you're planning to use the microphone, you might wait a couple of months until Amazon has finished selling the batch of headphones with defective microphones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_198?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=198&reviewerType=all_reviews"

YES.","January 9, 2019","The noise cancellation on these is absolutely amazing.  Truly second to nobody.  Proof is in the scientific measurements, which I checked out after purchase.  They can be found online at the rtings review website.  They offer a full cancellation frequency response charts, and you can plot any two headsets on a single graph.  Clear winner: this new headset.

Sound is amazing.  Few tips and tricks as an Android user:

I very much like having HI DEFINITION BLUETOOTH.  *EXCEPT*... you have to use with caution.  Notice the bass is a tad heavy on these, and the treble is a tad lacking.  I prefer rather flat response to perfectly reproduce the recording.  Now... if someone takes just a touch off bass and adds a tad on treble in the headphone app by Sony, then Hi-Def Bluetooth gets disabled, and you are stuck with standard def.  HOWEVER, if you do that same little tweak to the audio BEFOREHAND, say in the Google Music app, then hi-def bluetooth remains active.

One common complaint I have seen on reviews here that I have made to Sony directly, and will make again, until they fix it.  (You listening, Sony???  I'm waiting for the Firmware Update.  I'll check tonight.  Honestly haven't checked in a couple of months.)  - - - When on a call, the background noise comes through.  The epic noise cancelling present when listening to music is 100% disabled.  Now, specifically, the feedback I gave Sony:  I can see this as being a valid design decision.  I can see some folks passionately arguing for them the way they are.  I can also see folks passionately arguing for the way I prefer.  Personally... I'm a rather mercurial fellow.  I passionately want it the way they are some days.  Other days I passionately want them the other way.  THUS, I wrote Sony product support, and repeat hear (hoping they are reading/listening)... SONY... Please enable the functionality of ""Ambient Sound Control"" during calls AS WELL.  Right now that is only available during playback or silence.  That would take this headset from ""epic"" to ""legendary"".  Not that there is anything wrong with ""epic""... but really... don't you want to be ""legendary""???  ;-) ;-)

(Oh, and for those that do not have a set yet, get one, but what ""Ambient Sound Control"" does?  It is a slider bar in the phone app that one one side is 100% noise cancellation, the other side 0%.  Let's you allow some outside noise in.  Also, it has an option to ""Focus on Voice"", to just let in the ""most common"" vocal pitches.  Uncle Jerry's vacuum cleaner bass tone might still get blocked, and your mother in law's shrill tones might still get silenced, but the latter wouldn't be a loss. :-P)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Good luck switching from your computer to your phone. No matter what, it won't ""release"" it's connection from one device. For example, if I PAIR it with my computer, then turn bluetooth on it off, then pair with my phone, I am now paired with 2 devices.

HOWEVER, It will Always try to reconnect to the last device you used. If that was your computer, then even if you go into your phone and select the headphones from the pre-paired list... it refused to switch!!! You literally have to go to your computer and turn bluetooth OFF to get it to switch.

The only other way is to turn the headphones off, unpair the device from your phone,turn them back on and go straight into pairing mode, then repair the headphones with your phone.

This is a LUNATIC procedure to use headphones. Absolutely returned. I wouldn't even consider using any headphones with such a pitiful design. This is pure software and Sony could easily fix this, but I'm sure they're saving that ""feature"" for some new ""upgraded"" model in a couple years, to make us waste more money.

It was very deceiving that this information was not disclosed by Sony and/or Amazon because Sony is fully aware of the issue.  When speaking with Sony customer support (both over chat and the phone), I was told that this is normal operation for these headphones.  I was also told that, each time I go outside into cold weather, I would need to re-calibrate the touch sensor by restarting the headphones repeatedly until ambient outside temperature is reached.  As I live in the Midwest, I experience cold temperatures on my commute every single day, so essentially to ""resolve"" this problem, I need to re-calibrate the headphones every single day.  I'm not sure what Sony considers a ""resolution,"" but certainly I do not consider re-calibrating the headphones every single day to be a reasonable resolution.

This is a design flaw in this model (from what I've read in other reviews, the 1000XM2's did not have a similar flaw) that Sony is fully aware of, and as such, it is highly deceiving of Sony (and Amazon) to not disclose these issues as I'm sure there are others that would have purchased a different model had they been aware of these issues from the start.  Sony either needs to issue a recall or push through some type of update to correct this problem - in my opinion, it's absolutely absurd for Sony to sell $350 headphones with these types of issues and then not taking any responsibility or remedial action, but rather expect the consumer to manually calibrate the headphones daily just to allow them to function properly.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sony states that you need 'simply restart the headphones'. But it is nothing like simple:
First of all you need to wait until the freezing random pressing occurs and only then restart. You can restart right after you went outside - it won't help.
Second, you need to disable noise cancelling(you don't want to be hit by a car you didn't hear coming) by making two long presses on a hard button(but not too long, or it will run another sound calibration feature and you'll spend extra 10 seconds on it).
Third, you need to continue playing your songs, but even major music apps like spotify not always will continue to play from where you stopped, sometimes it playes next song or doesn't play anything. (Tested on Iphone, Pixel 2 and Pixel 3).

And now imagine your commute is like mine: walk to a bus(restart), from the bus to a metra train station(restart), from metra station into actual train(restart), get out of train(restart), walk into the station and walk-out back to winter street(restart).
5 (FIVE) restarts just before you get to work. 350 buck to keep yourself annoyed every time you go outside.

I also have a set of MDR-7506 wired studio monitors. Sony makes great high-end cans, and I vastly prefer their (relatively) flat and natural sound signature compared to Bose.

The 1st gen MDR-1000X was a great set of headphones, but like many, my pair had a cracking issue on the headband. Sony replaced the first gen with the second gen, which still has an intact headband for me.

The 2nd gen WH-1000XM2 was a minor improvement over the first gen and a really impressive package overall. The sound and noise canceling are superb to my non-audiophile but discerning ears, and they are very comfortable, even when worn on some of the longest flights in the world (e.g. EWR-HKG).

I had one major gripe with the first and 2nd gen, which I found was not resolved in the third gen (XM3). When riding buses, the headphones would rattle and make an annoying sound in the earcups. I thought Sony would have addressed this by the third generation, but there is really not much improvement from what I can tell after 2 bus trips yesterday.

But the dealbreaker on this third-gen set is the absolute unusability of the headphones in cold weather. I walk and commute in the city, which has me outdoors often. The touch controls DO NOT work outdoors in cold temperatures. Worse, the headphones will randomly pause, lower the volume, or go into the ambient noise mode when outdoors in the cold. You have to restart the headphones and reconnect to get things back to normal, and it's only a temporary fix.

I was really excited about this pair due to the slightly smaller size, USB-C charging, and improved NC. But I'm bummed Sony has not fixed the rattling issue, and the lack of touch controls in cold weather is an absolute dealbreaker for me. If you only use them indoors, this would be fine, but these are not headphones for commuters.

Until the next-gen set comes out or these issues are resolved, I would say the WH-1000XM2 is an overall better set of headphones and a better buy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Great? Meh.","December 26, 2018","I bought these, unsurprisingly enough, for travel. I'm a frequent long distance flyer, and like to while away my time in the air wrapped in music.

They are well made, as you would expect from Sony, and they look smart in a rather dull, modern way. They are a little tight on my head, but otherwise comfortable. They have various Bluetooth and remote functions, which work, are whizzy; and are only utilized in my case when I'm really bored.

The noise cancelling is stellar, the best I've heard. Engine sound is gone, external voices are gone (and in my personal experience, noise cancelling cans that do one well, do not do the other so well). What I really appreciate about it, in contra-distinction to Bose noise-cancelling headphones, is that it doesn't seem to compromise the sound quality. Bose noise cancelling simply sucks all the life and enjoyment out of music for me, whereas here it does not.

But I do think the sound quality of these headphones is good in much the same way that wireless speakers can be good. Which is to say, there is no discernable distortion at more than reasonable volumes, there is plenty of life, clarity and detail; and the sound spectrum is fully represented from top to bottom (though not to extremes in either direction). But not, I think, the naturalness air or rhythm that makes music come alive for me. The sound quality is more than adequate for films or games, mind you.

Now you get what you pay for, and I guess I would expect to pay quite a few more bucks for headphones that gave me my desired level of sound quality, and excellent noise cancelling. But when I've finished watching the film and I want to lie back, zone out and lose myself in some well crafted music, these headphones go back in their (very tidy) case; and my earphones, costing about the same, go into my ears. Background engine noise and all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I know it's because the macbook bluetooth isn't as good but I didn't have any issues w/ other bluetooth headphones i've used with this laptop over the years.

Also, this does a great job of canceling out ambient white noise (air conditioner humming for example) but not so good a job canceling out the higher tones of voices. I can still hear the voices of women talking near me, sounds tinny as the lower tones are canceled out.

This has happened on more than one occasion and I am generally protective of my hearing (e.g. I wear earplugs in a movie theater) so I believe that the noise-cancelling feature is flawed and causing hearing loss.

I cannot be certain but I only get one pair of ears in my lifetime and this is not something to mess around with.

They fit comfortably; I actually prefer this model's build to the previous model as I find it lighter and my ears don't get overheated. The noise cancellation is fine, although I think Bose still has an edge. But the sound quality when listening to music was great, so I gave away my Bose headphones in favor of these.

However, I really wanted to use these while traveling to both listen to music and take calls in airports, cafes, etc. I didn't really test run this for calls until a couple of months after purchasing (so outside of my return window). Sound quality on calls is absolutely terrible. Call quality is bad on both ends - for me and the person that I'm talking to. There is a weird echo when I speak. On multiple calls, the person on the other end told me they couldn't hear me because either a) the sound of my voice coming through the mic was too quiet (despite talking loudly into the headphones) or b) the background noise was drowning out my voice. Usually for calls, I had to disconnect and just switch to speaking on my mobile device or to significantly cheaper Bluetooth earbuds. Rather than cancelling out ambient noise during the call, the headphones actually seem to amplify all of the background noise. I don't understand why the noise cancelling seems to act differently for music vs. calls.

Additionally the gesture/touch controls are absolute sh*t. Any slight brush of my jacket hood, collar, hair, tilting my head activates the controls. It is infuriating. I would need to keep my head totally still in order to effectively use these.

Given the price point, I would have expected significantly better call quality from these headphones. I had given my old Bose QC 35 headphones to my mother once I bought the Sony WH1000XM3 but I'll probably try to resell these and purchase another pair of Bose QC 35. Really disappointing. I would give 3 stars because the sound quality for music is great, but overall the headphones are pretty much a paperweight now especially give that Sony doesn't provide an option to disable touch controls so I can't rate any higher than 2 stars.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Most BT headphones are not loud enough to compensate for my hearing loss.  Sony fixed it!! I can listen without my hearing aids and actually have to turn them down from full volume.  I have got to listen to music and heard it like I used to know it,  The highs,  the lows, the voice, it almost brought tears to my eyes to be able to hear music like it was meant to be.  The ability to adjust so many parameters thru the Sony app is truly amazing for me.  For you folks that have no hearing difficulties be ready to be blown away.  The noise cancellation is also amazing.  Sony has brought Music back into my life.  And to them I say thank you!  Buy these!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_194?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=194&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Very comfortable
Great sound quality for bluetooth headphones
noise cancelation is great specially on flights
2 catches tho:
Touch controls go on the fritz when it's less than 0 degrees C. Living in canada and having negative degree weather 6 months a year I can't go out with it. Tbf turning it off and on again usually fixes that.
second catch you can connect more than one device at a time if it's connected to your laptop you can't connect your phone you have to disconnect it from laptop before you connect phone and vice versa","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_74?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=74&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I purchased these headphones to help mask out the sound when my coworkers are discussing projects that I'm not working on and, along with a speech masking white noise sound track, do the job wonderfully.  I especially love the long battery life and how quickly they charge up. I'm not much of an audiophile so I'm probably not the best person to rate the sound quality but I have no complaint.

I've been flying quite a lot because of work and decided to pick up a pair of these instead of the Bose. I usually sit near the wing of the airplane by the window (where it's usually the loudest) because nobody else wants to sit there and MAN! Do these things drown out the noise. I don't hear anything. At first I was bothered because hearing nothing gives me major fomo and I want to be able to hear at least what's going on around me or if the pilot makes an announcement. Within the app, I can select the setting that 'Focuses on voice' and that clears it right up. You can even change the amount of ambient noise - I set it to like 13-16 so I can hear what's happening around me and that's perfect.

As for sound - these sound great! I'm by no means an audiophile but I enjoy listening to good music/podcasts and these are up there with the best pair of headphones I've ever listened to. Voices are clear out the box. Sound is nice and full with Bass which I like. Battery life is really good. Easily lasts me around 10 flights without having to worry about charging it. I also love how sleek the design is. Don't have to worry about it getting stolen or broken because the quality is top notch and they are minimalistic enough that people don't think I'm wearing something super fancy on my head or with a giant logo like Beats do.

Overall really great pair for the money, def plan on using these for the foreseeable future. if something does change, you guys will be the first to hear of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I also find them pretty comfortable.  And batter life hasn't been a problem.

Why 2 stars?

They're _really_ hard to use for multiple devices.  When I travel, I have my iPhone, my iPad and laptop.  For long flights, I'll typically vary which devices I'm listening to.  It could be a movie on my laptop, later a game on my iPad and later a podcast on my iPhone.

With most bluetooth devices, including AirPods, you simply open the new device, connect to the headphones & that's it.

With these headphones, it's a 3 step process:

1. on the old device turn off bluetooth for the devices.
2. on the new device, connect & wait for the headphones to connect
3. reenable bluetooth on the old device

Needless to say, it become really annoying.  I wouldn't have purchased these only because of this, and I'd advise you to avoid them.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I just got it and am still using them. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is the functionality of the charging hardware.  For a premium price, Sony could include a charging block and room in the case. Also, the charging cable is so short that its almost non-functional. I see noise canceling headphones almost 99% of the time in airports and on airplanes, if someone needed a charge the length of the cable in an airport is almost useless. I'm not suggesting an 8 foot cord, but 6 inches too short. I charge my headphones on my kitchen counter top and the length of the cord is still too short to lay the headphones down while I charge them, they have to lean up against the wall with tension on the cable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I would of like to have some aluminum part specially on the headbands or cups like Bose do. Well, I hope I was able to help someone on what to expect from these headphones.

Also the android Sony app didn’t give me any problems, it will prompt to update the headphones to firmware 2.0.

Super confortable!","December 25, 2018","I have a lot of headphones, but none of them as confortable as the sony’s. This is like a feather in yout head, i could hear 24 hours and still dont feel any kind of disconfort (i have a big head). The sound quality is very good, i would give an 8,5 out of 10 on sound quality (but i am using an iphone, so no LDAC or Aptx HD). They should sound better on Android phones with oreo 8.0 above.
Battery is stellar.
Noise canceling is ridiculous... is so freaking good.
So yes, i would recommend this headphone.

You can definitely go cheap and get yourself some skullcandy or Mpow headphones that'll surely do the trick. You can get some airpods and look like a full blown douche. However, spend the extra money and experience a world you didn't know existed.

Have you ever heard silence? I mean actual silence. I work in a restaurant and between the hood, customers and fridges all making noise, I rarely get peace of mind. That all changed after these bad boys though. The whole digital noise cancellation is worth the money by itself. Throw in the touch controls and quality of sound and I feel like a fool for not buying these months ago. Beats are overpriced and overrated. Skullycandy and Mpow provide you with a get what you pay for  type of headset. The only other company that can truly compete with elite sound performance is Bose and I still don't believe they have a headset this good for this price. Believe me, buy these headphones and I promise you it will be one of the best decisions you've ever made. 10000% recommend to any and everyone.

Maaaaaan, what a game changer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_53?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=53&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The fit and feel of these headphones is everything I could ask for! The active noise cancelling is on par with what I have experienced from Bose, however only at lower levels. I upgraded from a $50 pair of TaoTronics active noise cancelling headphones to these and found that when exposed to high levels of ambient noise (like while driving, especially with the windows cracked causing low frequency rumbling) these fell short of my cheap headphones!! There was audible distortion in the headphones as either the speakers ran out of travel or the amp reached it's power limit, not sure which.

The companion app is nice however I am disappointed in the lack of true parametric equalization - this is something that I expect from a pair of headphones costing $350. The built-in 5 band eq is okay but doesn't offer enough control to really make these headphones shine. The bass boost makes the headphones sound muddy and not enjoyable to listen to (100-140hz boost, not bass).

The headphones do sound good but they are not refined, and they lack deep bass. More design work could have gone in to optimizing their sound quality, but they are not fatiguing and will do for most customers.

I think the hype surrounding these comes from the fact that Bose has dominated this space for so long, people want to be excited about a competitor being able to match Bose's performance. I don't think Sony has revolutionized anything or even made substantial progress forward in the Bluetooth anc market, but it is a good quality product overall. Just not on par with what I expect from a flagship.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_49?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=49&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However after losing my Sh*t too many times after becoming tangled up  in cables/bag straps/coats, I decided to go wireless.  Of course, even for my day-to-day activities, I wouldn't be happy with tinny sounding low-quality audio, so I had to go big- and I'm glad I invested in these.

Pros:
* The sound quality is supreme,
* easy instructions for syncing with phones/devices;
* Extremely customizable with via phone:  EQ & Ambiance filter.  I really value the ability to adjust the ambient filter via the phone- this will be great for those days when walking down the street and I can choose the level of street sounds to allow in.

Cons:  All the options, especially, the ""optimization"" setting kinda freaks out this old school headphones girl / dystopian novel nerd- to hear the voice ""You've now been optimized"" as if it's coming from within my brain. Have they implanted a chip?  Will these earphones turn Black Mirrore-sque on us?  That's yet to be seen.

I think that the Bose QC35 and 35II are slight more comfortable because they have barely deeper and wider cups, but otherwise the fit and finish is superb on the Sony's.  I wish the Silver was a real silver color instead of a tope/tan/silver color.  I originally purchased those to replace my Bose QC35's and returned them for the black model because the color wasn't really silver.

As far as performance, battery life, sound quality etc. just stop reading reviews and buy these.  They're not audiophile headphones, but none that are noise cancelling really are.  These are by far the best overall noise cancelling headphones out there.  Audio quality is fantastic, noise cancelling is amazing and they're very comfortable.  The biggest complaint I have is switching between different devices because you can only be connected to one at a time.  Sometimes I can get two to try to connect, but the headphones wont switch back and forth from unless one of the others is disconnected.

The Sony WH-1000XM3 is a great pair of headphones that hold their own against the tenured Bose. The Sony's provide a fun and full listening experience to a wide array of music genres that will make most perfectly content with their purchase. Bose's QC headphones will provde a more refined and pleasent listening experience especially for the discerning listener and will provide a stronger noise cancelling performance in a home or office setting. The stronger sound signature of the Sony will hold out better in a lounder atmosphere such as a plane, train, or automobile with its stronger bass performance. The Sony's lack the grace and balance of the QCs, but will provide a more familiar experience to the majority of listeners and will appeal more to someone who likes the sound of Apple's Beats, but is looking for a more professional or subtle design.

Full Review:

For the Sony WH-1000XM3 ($350), I will primarily compare it to the Bose Quiet Comfort (QC)($350) since even though they are all in the same relative price range, they are technically closer in price and age. I will also provide a little comparison to Bose's NC700 ($400) and Sennheiser's Momentum ($400) in the summary. Also, I will primarily discuss the pair of headphones in question and how it relates feature-wise to the Bose's Quiet Comfort (not QCII) headphones while refraining from giving too many details about the others, since you can read more specifically about those pairs individually in the review posted under their respective products. The reason for that is mainly to keep the review from becoming a master's thesis in subjective preferences. :)

Initial Impression:

Starting with the packaging. Simple and straight forward. The outer shell has a nice texture to it, but sliding out the insert with the headphones in it reveals a very simple package structure made up of just the case holding the headphones inside a box. However, the case itself feels really nice and has a sleek color palette. Very appealing to feel and look at in my opinion. Although the case is a touch bigger than the one for Bose's QC, it does a better job of holding its headphones. The QC's case always feels uncomfortably tight when putting them away. Sony's case neatly holds everything comfortably (without having to squish them in to zip it closed). The case is stiff, but not really hard. The inside is the same as the QCs with a soft microfiber feel to it. The headphones fold up inside with three little slots to the right for (inside to outside) the airplane adapter, 3.5mm aux cord, and USB Type-C charger cable.

The Headphones:

When I first picked them up out of the case, they felt nice. Soft plastic with a good feel to them. The plastic has a sparkle to it with a matte finish that resists fingerprinting decently. The band of leatherette on top is soft and has good cushion. Similarly around the ear cups. Very soft and nice to the touch. Not as stiff as the QCs. The click of the band when expanding it is satisfyingly stiff. At the top of both ear cups, you can see one of the microphones in a rose gold finish. Some other smaller holes are hidden around more subtly for the NC array. I feel this is a minor plus for the Sonys. The QC's microphones are a little more prominent and pick up wind a lot more outside. The USB Type-C port is at the bottom of the right cup with an indicator light. The left cup has the power button along the bottom back with the button for toggling the noise cancelling level just above it. Inside the ear cups, there is microfiber layer covering the drivers over a layer of foam. Overall the Sony's feel a little lighter than the QC's but also feel just slightly more flimsy when handling them. But the design is also more appealing and fluid and frankly more premium.

When comparing the headphones while putting them on, the QC again feel more snug and naturally isolating before turning them on. The cups feel like they form a better seal given the stiffer covers and the QC also have angled drivers that leave natural room for your ears inside the cup, making the headphones not feel like they are sitting on your ears, but rather around them. The Sony are by no means uncomfortable, but may tend to be less comfortable for longer wear times and might make your ears prone to getting hotter.

Sound Quality:

For starters in this section, I will compare the noise cancelling. Upon turning the Sonys on, you are greeted by a woman's voice that sounds like it is in a tin can or cave when she speaks. When the NC kicks in, it does a darn good job of removing ambient sound and muffling people talking somewhat. It feels very close to the NC of the QCs, but I would still give them a leg up because the Sonys have a much more noticeable white noise factor playing whereas the QC feel more like they just sucked the sound out of the atmosphere around you. For the traveling folk (I primarily wear them in a typical office setting which any of these work plenty well for), I would say given the more aggressive, forward, pronounced sound stage with the Sonys, you will find them blocking sound better in a car or plane without the sound (especially on the lower, bass end) being washed out. The QCs have better NC, but the sound is softer in general so the sound still gets overwhelmed in a car/plane. I am not saying the NC is not doing its job, just that what you are left with is weaker with the QCs because the sound itself is subtler and more refined so you have to turn them up louder to make up for this.

Now, it is difficult to judge sound since it is so subjective, but I will try to give my own impression of what each headphone may be better for. I listen to a wide range of genres, so I can appreciate many styles of music and how they are represented by different types of headphones and speakers. First, the Sonys bring a more forward sound. The sound stage isn't as wide as the QCs. Instruments get mixed together and lost in the fray. The sound of the Sonys feels more akin to that of Beats Studio. The bass is more pronounced and punchy which may be more appealing to some. If you prefer a balanced and clean representation, the QCs will serve you better. As you turn the volume up, the Sonys also lose more of their balance and can become muddy. The QCs give more of an impression that the music is playing around you, while the Sonys just feel like they're playing music. (if you really want to feel like you are on stage with the music, Sennheiser's HD800S is king. The HD700 or HD660S do a good job too at a better price, but these are all studio headphones, so totally different use case to begin with.)

Where I really felt more of the performance shining through came in the Rap, R&B, or even some EDM/House area. I can definitely appreciate Sony more for some 2pac, Destiny's Child, Infected Mushroom, or Daft Punk. They are little too aggressive for music you may want a finer touch with such as jazz or opera. When listening to some Kenny G, David Benoit, or Keiko Matsui, you get that groove, but the fine details and intricacies of the instruments are sacrificed. Also, the sharp trills of the piano keys and saxophone are a bit much at higher volumes. The visceral in-your-face nature of the sound also makes them pretty fun for bands in the vein of Disturbed, Five Finger Death Punch, Pantera, and Metallica. Going a bit further that direction, with the likes of Eluveitie and Slayer it will be more likely to give you a headache from the unsubdued highs and thrashing sounds. Taking a couple steps back and going for some more classic rock like the Eagles, Journey, Gerry Rafferty, etc., the QC will perform better, but they are fine with Sony's headphones. Finally, when listening to music with a gentler atmosphere like Norah Jones, Ray LaMontagne, Ludovico Einaudi, or Celtic Woman, I would have to give it to Bose's QCs again but the Sony did liven them up a bit in a way.

Features:

Both Sony and QC have three levels of NC. High, Ambient sounds, and off. The QC handle this a lot better. The mid level for the Sony feels worthless and clumsy without audio playing. It almost sounds better being turned off. On the QC, the mid level provides a good balance and allows you to wear them outside on a windy day with reduced noise from the wind in the NC microphone. However, in the case of the QC (instead of the QCII), you need the app to change the NC level.

The QC claim 20 hours of battery, which I have thoroughly proven to be true in the years I have owned them. Sony's claim 30 hours, which I have also found to be true, but I haven't had them nearly as long to see how they hold up over time. Also having had the QCs for longer, I have had to replace the ear pads after about 2 years. This process was easy and made them feel and sound new again with the better seal of fresh pads. The process for both headphones appears to be the same.

Call quality is great for both headphones. I also use them for Skype calls from my laptop at work where they work great. However, this is one of those places the Sony completely dropped the ball. Bose's QCs allow two devices connected at the same time, and you can switch seamlessly between them which makes them great for the office. I have them on the laptop and my phone at the same time. I can listen to music while working. When its meeting time, I just join the Skype call and it immediately picks up. If I get a call on my phone, it switches back over. When I am done, music is ready to go. I don't have to touch anything. Next time I turn them on, it picks backup to the laptop and my phone immediately.

Both charge fast. Just a few minutes will give me a couple hours of use in a pinch. Both also have apps. The Bose app is laid out better and more useful, but neither are really great or even necessary except in the case of the Bose being able to sync two pairs of Bose headphones to play the same music or audio through both. This may be a good deal for a couple seeking to both watch a movie on a plane or something. I have done this a couple times and it works well once setup. It is a nice feature in favor of Bose, but I haven't really found a lot of use for it in reality.

For the Sonys, you have the features with the right cup having touch controls. This is fairly slick and works better than I expected. It only took a couple attempts to get the hang of it and it is responsive. Swipe up and down for volume. Swipe left and right for skipping tracks. Double tap to play and pause. And finally, if you hold your fingers on the right ear cup, it will turn the volume down and turn on the external microphone to catch ambient sound if you need to talk to someone really quick without stopping your music. A nice feature, but I personally haven't found much use for it. Might be useful for people in a bigger city like NYC walking around with the headphones constantly and you don't want to take them off every time you need to listen for a moment.

Conclusion:

Sony's WH-1000XM3 are no slouch and stand up for themselves at this price range. For someone looking for a pair of headphones with solid noise cancelling, flexible and diverse performance across genres and premium features, you won't go wrong with these. I dock them to 4/5 stars simply because in my own opinion, they fall short of Bose's QC series at the same price range in the overall quality and balance of the sound, noise cancellation ability, and the ability to connect to two devices at once and seamlessly hand off between them which is extremely handy for business people in today's multi-device world. Now, for my brief mention of the slightly more expensive options in the Bose NC700 and Sennheiser Momentum. If you are willing to step just a bit further up to the $400 mark, you will get even better quality, better noise cancelation, more premium feel and just overall better devices. However, I will propose that with the Sony or Bose QCs, you would not go wrong. For the majority of people, I would not say the extra money is worth it for the marginal increase over these headphones. It will mostly come down to your preference in sound.

I will try to keep these reviews updated as time goes on and if anything comes up. Feel free to ask any questions and I will give a response when I can.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Cornette","Significant improvement over the Bose QC35 II","February 4, 2019","I bought these to replace the Bose QC35 II, which I found to be a major step down from the QC35's.  I seem to be alone in this, but the active noise cancelation in the QC35 II actually hurts my ears after less than an hour.
However, I still have my QC35 II and after receiving Sony WH1000XM3, I decided to do some side by side comparison.

Out of the box (default settings):
Sound quality - QC 35II wins, being noticeably less bass heavy.
Noise canceling - The WH1000XM3 wins hands down.  Virtually eliminates all but very loud ambient noise (HVAC, engine noise, fans, etc) and significantly reduces incident noise (finger snaps, voices, tapping, knocks, etc.). I found the QC35 II to be somewhat less effective against ambient noise and almost useless against incident noise.  That said, when you are playing music or a video, both headphones eliminate enough sound to make all but the loudest ambient and incident sound negligible.
App features - The WH1000XM3 wins hands down again on this.  It is far more feature rich than the Bose companion app.  The EQ is much more usable, the noise cancellation is adjustable, and the soundstage can be customized to make the source seem to be in one of six different locations.  It also has a mode that uses the microphones and some reference tones to adjust the noise cancellation to compensate for your head shape and whether or not you wear glasses, etc.  I did notice some difference, but not an overwhelming difference, after applying this feature.
Headphone controls - The WH1000XM3 wins hands down again.  The buttons on the QC35 II are minimal and not easy to remember if you don't use the headphones often.  The WH1000XM3 has only two buttons, which are different sizes to make them easy to differentiate.  The rest of the controls are done by a touchpad on the right ear piece.  I found this to be extremely intuitive, and was grateful that a single tap on the touchpad does nothing, so it's difficult to accidentally trigger an action.
Other features:  The WH1000XM3 wins again, narrowly.  Both headphones have a complete set of features you'd expect on high-end phones in the smartphone era.  The WH1000XM3 have one added feature that is nice, but not a must have by any means.  If you cup your hand over the right ear piece, the volume of the music/video lowers down to just audible, the noise canceling turns off, and the headphones port outside noise into your ears.  This is nice if you're listening and your wife starts talking to you.  But at the end of the day, it's only slightly better than taking the headphones partly or completely off.
Comfort:  I'll give these a tie.  Both are lightweight and ergonomically designed with rotating ear cups.  Both have good padding in both headband and ear cup.  Any difference between the two will be minimal and totally personal.  As I mentioned earlier, I find the noise cancellation in the Bose very uncomfortable after a relatively short time, but this seems to be unique to me, so I wouldn't consider that if you're trying to choose between the two.
Accessories:  This is a complete tie.  Both come with the same set of cables (1/8"" cable, airplane two-prong adapter, micro-USB for charging) and both come with very similar flat, semi-rigid travel cases of about the same size, with a stretchy pocket on the outside.

After making adjustments:
The WH1000XM3 comes out of the box very bass heavy.  After making some easy adjustments in the companion app, it's easy to balance them out.  Personally, I found that reducing the bass boost to -7, and adjusting the EQ to increase treble frequencies and reduce the lower mids, I got vast improvement.  In fact, although it's fairly close and pretty subjective, I found the adjusted sound in the WH1000XM3 to be better than anything I could achieve adjusting the QC35 II.  Better balance, more spacious sounding, much clearer bass, less edge in the treble.

The WH1000XM3's were purchased to replace my QC35 II for travel use (primarily).  However, by the time I'd finished getting used to them and making the adjustments to solve the heavy bass, I had really come to love them, and they are have replaced my daily wear cans.  About the only thing I won't wear them for now is high-end reference listening where I need absolute fidelity.  No bluetooth headset can match good wired reference headphones for that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have had them for almost a year so this review is based on a significant testing period. The noise-canceling is very effective. When I have them on I literally can not hear someone sitting next to me talking. It's great to meditate with them. Also, the music quality is very good. I can hear all of the instruments when listening including those that I can not when not listening with them. I also use them wired to DJ a radio show. I should mention that I bought these reluctantly after returning TWO pairs of the competing Bose class. There was no comparison in range, noise canceling, and comfort. All good.

Amazon was awesome, understand my frustration were able to help resolved the issue connecting me with Sony tech.  Sony has recognized that there's a problem, Amazon stepped up to swap the device.  Again, it's an awesome gear, when its wired, sounds great, but with BT its ok, for the money $348.99, optimistically cautious...

Update:  Finally, I got the same but a Japanese domestic product...felt the difference right at the first.  No rattling sound, rather firm...More than Sony, my thanks to AMAZON...customer service was absolutely amazing.  Here and there one or two representatives gave run around, but few good folks, nailed it and stayed with me until every process get completed.  Truly appreciate Amazon.

WITHOUT AMAZON'S GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE I would not be able to post this.  After a swap of the headphone AGAIN, this time, a japanese domestic use product was purchased, and what a difference...a headphone as it should be.  No more rattling sound...sounds crystal clear, spectrum of frequencies spills out of the headphone.  Don't know why the difference...but surely thank Amazon for their patience and excellent customer service.

Dean","AMAZING noise cancellation!!","March 13, 2019","OH MY GOODNESS!!  We originally bought one pair for my wife who had suffered a severe concussion and was having difficulty with doing her job with all the background noise. We were almost to the point that she would have to quit her job. I chose Sony as they were rated #1 in noise cancellation on a couple of websites.  Sony completely solved the problem for her.  They were so good that she insisted that I get a pair for myself to help with distraction in my office.  I don't even have to turn on any music, the noise cancellation gets rid of the most annoying background noise without it.  There is a phone app that has a noise cancelling ""optimizer"" that I run every time I put it on so that it accounts for any little differences in the background, things like atmospheric pressure.  The difference between 0.8 and 0.9 atmosphere has a big effect on noise cancellation effectiveness.  They are also extremely comfortable to wear for long periods of time.  They are a stupid amount of money, but they work amazingly and you are paying for a lot of high tech to make it work so well.  If you are already looking in this price range, I would highly recommend them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The consensus between my fiance and I was the Sony WH1000XM3's had the best sound over Bose/Beats/Sennheiser/Audio-Technica. And to be honest, it really wasn't close.

PROS:
1) Sound quality for all types of music. I personally listen to a lot of bass music, and its so crisp and boomy.
2) Very comfortable.
3) Features in the accompanying app. The EQ is super customizable along with the presets, and you can customize the ambient sound quality (noise cancelling).
4) Battery Life... it's incredible how much charge these hold. They also charge super quick. I plug mine in to charge maybe once a week and I use them 4-5 hours a night.

CONS
1) If I had to nit-pick, these are definitely not built for the gym or working out.

Lintault","Not the best as many reviews say.  I regret buying these haedphones","June 1, 2019","So I have a real love hate opinion of these headphone.  Yes they have amazing sound quality, Iove the incredible noise cancelling...you are in your own personal cone of silence and are very comfortable...BUT this is all swept away because the hinges creak constantly unless you do not move your head.  The creaking introduces a huge distraction and completely negates the sound and NC quality because of the noise it makes.  When brand new it does not happen and it takes about a month for them to get going but then it is constant and so aggravating because the cost of the headphones was so much.  I even returned them to Sony for another pair and they also became creaky after one month.  In addition the touch controls are clunky at best and 4 out of 5 times I have to redo the motion to get the action I wanted, and often times it does another action instead.  I have an older pair of sony NC headphones with physical controls and they were perfect in that regard.  I am about to get another brand of headphone but I really feel cheated by Sony because of their poor design.  A friend has the MX2's and he said they did the same as well, so this is an enduring design flaw they never have fixed.  Do not get cheated and buy these headphone unless you want to hear creak creak creak where you take a step, move our head or chew.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Phone calls: horrible quality, others said that I sounded as if I was 10 feet away from the mic. In addition, headphones picked up too much of outside noise and it was hard for me to hear others.
Multiple devices: Paired with 2 devices(followed Sony's Multipoint connection instructions), but it did not work. To switch, I had to turn off Bluetooth on one of the devices. Sometimes needed to reconnect manually. That's unacceptable at this price point. Maybe I got a defective item, but
I give 2 stars, 1 for great sound, 1 for great ANC.
P.S. I checked many online resources and found that others are having same issues. There are even post on Sony forum. Apparently, Sony does not care about customers.

Fortunately, there is also a feature that automatically adjusts for loud volume outside depending on the situation (e.g. traffic) but the fact that such a feature is fascinating.

I'm a medical student so being able to study in quiet is nice. I bought these at the recommendation of many reviewers who said they were superior to Bose QC35 in sound quality and equal in comfort. That sounded like a good deal.

Unfortunately, while the claims of great sound were well-met by these headphones, the comfort was lacking. I need headphones that I can put on my head and forget about completely. These headphones were not that. I could make it roughly 2 hours before a headache started. The headache gradually worsened the longer I wore them. I really wanted to like these, because the sound quality was great, the noise cancelling was pretty good, and the ambient noise mode was super convenient. But at the end of the day I can't keep a product that gives me a significant headache after just a couple hours of wear. I don't know what caused the headaches, but after trying a friend's Bose QC35's for a day, I think it may have something to do with the tighter, somewhat heavier fit of the XM3's. Where the Bose's seem to distribute their light weight evenly across head and ears, the XM3's hold most of their (significantly heavier) weight on top of the head. The ears also fit fairly tightly, so the overall effect is a pretty strong squeeze. For the record, I have a normal sized head. Promise. And again, the Bose model fit perfectly with no discomfort at all.

Ultimately, these are good headphones with good features. But comfort is a major concern. If you can try them out before buying, do that. Anyone who will be wearing these for hours at a time should try to recreate that scenario before assuming comfort is guaranteed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I need/want:
1. Noise Cancelling Bluetooth - these are the best I've tried
2. Good build and sound - very comfortable and sound is great
3. USB C to charge - I want to pack one cable, when the 3 series came out with USB C I thought my search was over
4. Google Assistant - I use it all the time now and it worked perfectly on these
5. Multipoint - this is where these fail for me, I need to be connected to my phone and work computer at the same time and was shocked that Sony left this out

If these had multipoint, they would be perfect.  My only hope now is that Bose will come out with a Q35 III with usb C.  Right now, the Bose are missing USB C and the Sony's are missing multipoint.  If anyone reading this knows of a headphone that meets my 5 things please respond because after a year, I'm still looking.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

And they have. They are just as good as the QCs, the differences in noise-cancelling are minor, if any, but the other differences are its touch-sensitive outer piece. It works great, but feels unnecessary. The leather ear cushion creates a great barrier, and almost too good, as it creates a bit of a suction.

Here’s my take.
Product came packaged undamaged in a nice solid box.  Headphones have a good quality case that can take some real abuse.  It arrived with very simple cartoon picture instructions.  So far everything is going fine.  Charged them up and wow.
Very good noise canceling and excellent sound quality.  I am a musician, a very critical listener, and I have a good ear.  I also used my test CD’s for a frequency check.  I am quite happy with the quality of sound, but read on.
WARNING!
I purchased these to use in a loud construction environment, operating diesel powered equipment and driving trucks.  As much as I’m enjoying them, and as well as they work, they are rather cheaply made and somewhat flimsy.  If you purchase be careful.  I recommend this product only if it will be used in a normal environment such as inside a car or house.  It’s simply not tough enough to wear operating heavy equipment, outside on a lawn mower, anywhere you might need to take them on and off frequently, or if you’re wearing work gloves.  I’m disappointed because that was exactly where I needed them.  I’m still using solid, construction quality ear protection rather than the Sony headphones.  A disappointment for me, but perhaps not everyone is driving diesel trucks and tractors outside in the weather.
Additionally Sony could have designed a better hold down strap that keeps the charging and cable cords secure.  It’s useless since they will both just fall out.  I already lost the charger cord after one use.
I can’t give you a report on talking on cell phones, so read other reviews.
To the big question.  Would I buy them again?  Do I recommend them?  Yes, but only with the understanding they are very easy to break if roughly handled, and the minor complaint the hold down strap in the case is mostly useless.
Synopsis:
* Easy to use.
* Excellent noise cancellation.
* Excellent sound quality.
* Good solid case that will take abuse and protect the headphones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_44?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=44&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've been able to compare with my coworkers' headphones, and am very happy with the purchase.
Compared to the QC35iis, it's lighter and has better bass, and the noise cancelling leaves me with less of a 'pressure' feeling.
Compared to the WH1000XM2s, both the sound quality and noise cancelling are way better.

Having a Pixel, it's nice having most of my travel environment be on USB-C. The headphones are easy to fold and carry, and the case has a slot to put the cables inside, which is a nice improvement from the last case. Battery lasts a long time; never measured, but I can usually go 1-2 work days without charging these guys.
One qualm I have is that I don't seem to be able to tweak the NC when not connected to my phone/using the app. Not sure how to do that on the computer, but the change in NC is significant when switching between my phone and my computer on bluetooth.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I certainly enjoy using the headphones, they're comfortable, and the sound quality is good. Noise cancellation is fairly solid, although it certainly isn't as good as just putting in some in ear headphones with high quality foam tips. Even the battery life is pretty good, assuming you're using them for extended periods of time.

Unfortunately, there are some serious issues that drag this down and make me wish I'd have gone with the Bose 700's (which I will likely do anyway). In no particular order the pain points I found were:

1. Touch Controls. Barely usable while sitting perfectly still, mostly due to the poor direction detection and the attempt to use 4 way touch controls (Up, down, left, right). Having to swipe up 4 or 5 times to get the volume to change by an appreciable level is already annoying, and having 2 or those attempts accidentally skip a song forward or backward is just misery. Double tap to start/stop music is....unreliable as well.

2. Control ""App"". Doesn't really give you much control, doesn't seem to work well with the system controls (i.e. you stop a song in your music app of choice, but the Sony headphone connect app has no idea whats going on, and thinks sound is still playing) The vast majority of controls are hidden away in this, and most of them aren't customizable so if you'd like to change what the buttons do, or turn off the terrible touch controls, well you're out of luck.

3. Probably the biggest gripe on my list, because its both simple to implement, and nearly universal elsewhere - No battery saver/auto-shut-off/etc (full disclosure, there is allegedly an auto-shut-off if you move them out of Bluetooth range. Which is basically useless). If you're listening to music, and you fight the touch controls to pause a song, then set the headphone down to do something else, Sony assumes it should just keep canceling noise and waiting ever so patiently for your return. This isn't so great for the battery life, fyi.

3a. I'm not saying the headphones need to be able to detect if they're on your head or not, (I mean, my shitty airpods can do that....), but the bare minimum for functionality here is auto-shut-off when sound isn't playing. This is something that *should* be configurable in the ""App"" and *should* be able to support both auto-shut off without music and I dunno use one of the 2 buttons on here to disable the auto-shut-off and let you use just the noise cancellation if you want. I've likely used about as much battery listening to music as I have forgetting that these things are on, and not wearing them, while they happily cancel sound, for no reason.

Anyway, if it were my money, I'd buy some SE215's or 315's with the bluetooth connector cable. Which is what I did. Tada!","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Problems included poor sound quality (distortions even at low volume, fuzzy, hollow, even after tuning with the app), inability to maintain Bluetooth connection from more than a couple feet away from source, would lose Bluetooth connections if I turned my head (tried with multiple sources and distances), and people I spoke with using the mic said they were getting echoes from me and that I sounded far away. Also, the plastic construction while light/comfortable reeks of cheapness and seems fragile. The leatherette covering the foam ear muffs is liquid-thin and pitifully cheap; was already showing slight cracks out of the box.

Pilot","Definitely the best of the current ""Big Three""...","October 26, 2019","The Sony WH1000XM3 headphones are 1/3 of THE trifecta of wireless headphones, including the Sony offering, the Sennheiser PXC550 headphones, and the Bose QC35-II headphones. I have been able to try all three, and can say that the Sony headphones are the winner for me.

NEGATIVES:
(1) I really only have found one and it's rather glaring -- these headphones can only be paired with one device at a time.  Meaning that if you've already paired them with your phone, when you want to use them with your laptop you have to completely go through the pairing process all over again.  And once you have it paired with your laptop and want to go back to your phone, you have pair everything all over again.  I really can't believe Sony botched this feature this badly, and I really don't know what they were thinking.

A minor negative is that the Sony headphone app is not compatible with Android on Chromebooks. Although I have a monster bulky Asus ROG gaming laptop, I mainly use my Acer Chromebook while on the go, and although the Chromebook runs Google Play Android apps, the Sony headphone app reports that it's not compatible with this device.  So when using these headphones with my Chromebook, they're aren't anywhere near as tweakable as when I'm using it on my phone.  I'm sure it would work with a genuine Android tablet, but I don't use Android tablets anymore since I got the Chromebook.

Another minor annoyance is the tiny little 6"" (at best) USB-C charge cable that Sony includes.  It's just simply not convenient to charge these headphones on such a short cord, and it really would've only cost Sony maybe pennies to include a more standard 3' cord.

POSITIVES:
(1) These headphones are very comfortable to wear, even for longer periods of time. They are just slightly less comfortable than the Bose QC35-II headphones, which feel like magical unicorn sparkle angel pillows on your ears.

(2) A big thumbs up for future-proof USB-C charging! I haven't found any other brand of higher end headphone using it yet, so I suspect that Sony is the first.

(3) The ANC feature is superb -- definitely equal to, if not actually superior to, the Bose QC35-II headphones.  And the app makes it even better by allowing you to tweak it to your personal preferences.

(4) Another big thumbs up for Sony making the wired cord 3.5mm to 3.5mm rather than having a more proprietary (and difficult to replace) 2.5mm on one end.  Again, I'm pretty sure Sony is the only one doing this in higher end headphones for some reason.

(5) Sound quality is excellent and in direct comparison I think it's better than the Bose QC35-II. I realize this is rather subjective, though, but I really have nothing negative to say about Sony's sound quality, whereas I felt the Sennheiser PXC550 sound quality was rather poor.

(6) Sony put the right amount of touch controls and hardware buttons on these headphones.  One thing I really didn't like about the Sennheiser PXC550 headphones is that they didn't have a hardware on/off switch and instead the power option is built-in to rotating the ear cups.  That just seemed like something that would quickly break and I also never did figure out how I was supposed to turn off the headphones while still using them wired.  There's simply no way to turn them off.  Sony has a dedicated hardware power button, as well as a multi-function button that can be setup (via the app) to control ANC or digital assistants, etc.  So far I haven't had any problems with accidentally activating a touch function. Volume, skip, and pause touch functions have all been very responsive.

(7) Although I'm not using the included case (I bought a 3rd-party case that I like better), it's still a really nice case.  I think the Bose case is nicer, but the Sennheiser case was just pathetic and wasn't much better than a bag in terms of protecting the rather expensive headphones.

Overall, without getting into too many specifics about the other two headphones, I rate the Sony headphones as the best for me.  The slightly beat out the Bose QC35-II headphones in terms of ANC as well as sound quality, and there's simply no comparison when it comes to Sony's touch controls and superior USB-C charging.  The difference between the Sony headphones and the Sennheiser PXC550 headphones was like night and day. The Sennheisers had vastly inferior sound quality and horrible comfort to the point that I couldn't even really test/compare the ANC because there's simply no way I could keep the Sennheisers on my head long enough (the ear cups are actually painful).  It was also a nice touch that the Sony headphones came to me fully charged, whereas the Bose and Sennheiser headphones were only partially charged.  Who wants to wait to fully charge their new device?

So, in summary, the Sony WH1000XM3 headphones slightly nudge out the Bose QC35-II headphones, whereas the Sony headphones obliterate the Sennheiser PXC550 headphones so badly that they really aren't even in the same category.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Having now used them for a few days including train rides, I'm blown away at how good these are and how they exceeded every expectation.

Sound - so much clearer than others, you feel in the music.
Noise cancelling - i can have someone next to me talking and not hear them, they are that good. It's a bit unnerving too though so I can't keep it on all the time
Microphone - great if you have the headset on the right way - this is so strangely critical. I wore it backwards on a phone call and noone could hear me. Was frustrated and though the mic was bad... realized I had it on backwards and magically everyone heard me just fine. Noise canceling is great at picking up on your voice too.
All in all, highly recommended. Just love them all around.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Prefer them to my Bose Quiet Comfort Headphones.","September 21, 2018","I was excited to compare them to my Bose Quiet Comfort 35 headphones, and I got a pair free from Sony for review. First glance, I definitely prefer the look of these Sony's. They're more sleek and a little more modern looking. They also seem to have a bit of a lower profile on my head.

Sound-wise, they're phenomenal. The app lets you do cool things like adjust the ambient sound control and EQ and even optimize for atmospheric pressure, which is a little over my head, but they definitely left no stone unturned. I haven't tried them on a flight yet, but I imagine they'll be pretty unbelievable in that context. I was a touring musician for 8 years and I'm super used to in-ears and over the ear cans for recording and these feel super punchy and detailed. Seem to have a little more punch than the Bose as well.

In regards to comfort, the actual ear foam is amazing, although I will say after wearing them for about an hour the top of my head gets a little sore. The Bose headphones tend to do the opposite, where my ears get a little sore after long use. But these just require a little repositioning and you're good to go. Super light and enjoyable to wear though otherwise.

My favorite thing though, and where I think they really shine in comparison to the Bose headphones, is control. I had no idea these were gesture controlled, which is a super dope feature. You swipe forward or back on the ear to move tracks and up or down to adjust volume. So simple, but really amazing in practice.

Ultimately both are great headphones, but if I had to choose between the two, would definitely go with the Sony pair. Hope that helps!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_197?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=197&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I expected much more than they delivered. The sound quality is good enough, although I am not wowed by it. I like the sleek look of both the headphones and the storage “purse.” The headphone set is comfortable on my head and the cans don’t crush my ears like some sets do. But the noice cancelling is very poor! I have used other noise cancelling headphones, so I know what the difference between ambient sound and noise cancelling should be. And these don’t provide that wall of silence. Maybe I got a bum set? The other annoyance is that the finger-touch volume changing doesn’t always work. I guess it’s fussy or something, but I can get it to work less than 50 percent of the time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews"

In the package you get:
• The foldable headphones. They fold into a pretty small space, but the folding is not fully intuitive, but there is a template in the case to help you along.
• An airplane two-prong adapter; nice, but is this really needed anymore?  Maybe on Air Tajik.
• A 48” male-male aux connector, one end straight and the other “L”; good length, and a good thing to add into the package.
• A 9” USB-to-mini USB cord; this cord is way, way too short.  Put another 27” on it, at least.
• Documentation/instructions; very well done.
• A black zippered carrying case.

There is no assembly required, other than connecting your cord to the phones and going.  Mine had a little charge left, but it faded pretty quickly; you’ll need about three hours to charge them up fully.  If you’re going corded, the phones work just fine without a charge and without going noise-canceling, but a lot of the really cool control features do not work, such as the volume and music selection controls.

Optimal use of this rig is with the app, which is available at the Play Store and with Apple.  Of course, this means that Sony is tracking what you listen to, how often, probably how loud, at what time of day/night, and every other possible metric you can think of.  That’s your tradeoff.  The app enables the touch controls on the right ear cup, which are pretty cool.  These controls do NOT work when you’re going corded.

When you switch the phones on you get a very pleasant female voice announcing “power on” and then “power off” when you shut down.

Comfort: As a longtime Bose noise-canceling owner, I have to admit: the Bose rig is more comfortable.  The cups are bigger and softer, and the headband does not weigh as heavily.  This is not to say that this rig is uncomfortable; it is quite nice.  The set adjusts easily and quickly, and the cups do fit snugly and completely around the ears for isolation to allow full noise cancellation effect.

Sound: so how do they sound?  First of all, the Bose noise-cancellation is better.  It’s more complete.  These cancel noise very well, but when you cut the phones on you get a subtle background hiss.  They work, and work well, but by my comparison Bose is better.

If you like loud, these go loud, and there is a surprising lack of distortion.  They really do rock, and reproduce both bottom-end and high-end sound quite well.  Voice comes through clearly, and separation is very clear and distinct.

Unlike the Bose noise-canceling phones, these have a rechargeable battery, not a standard battery.  That’s a plus, but you’ll need to plan ahead on charging.

Documentation: Lots of paperwork with this item, all of it highly instructive and useful.  The controls and all of the features are very well presented and clear.  You will need the instructions, as some of the controls are not really that intuitive.  You get lots of contact info for Sony in case you have a problem with the set, or in case you have questions.

Price: These come in at about $350.  Yeah, expensive.  But they fully deliver on all stated features, and then some.  This is a high-end product, with a ton of features and premium sound, so I do believe that this is a valid price, approximately equal to what Bose is getting for their noise-canceling headphones.

Bottom Line: This is a premium corded/cordless set of headphones, with a very nice set of features.  I recommend you audition these and the Bose before you purchase, as they are highly similar, but differ in a few subtle ways, specifically the noise cancellation and sound reproduction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_198?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=198&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm no authority on noise canceling headphones.  I've only had a few different sets and this set was by far the most expensive.  So the question is, did it work on the plan?  It didn't completely eliminate the sound of the engines, but enough where it wasn't noticeable unless you listened for it.

Extra:
One of the cool features was to change from Noise-canceling to Ambient Sound.  This was useful when the Flight Attendants or Pilot was speaking...it stops whatever media you're playing and you can hear everything slightly amplified without having to take your headphones off.  A couple button pushes later and you're back to noise-canceling.

The other thing I like was the gestures to the right earpiece.  You can stop the music, fast-forward, or reverse, increase/decrease volume...all with swipes or taps.

Overall, I""m happy with my purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Can not complain about the audio quality at all. It feels comfortable and premium overall.

My listening experience has dramatically improved. The sound quality is very good. But more surprisingly, the soundstage is very broad. I have used them for audiobooks, music (Classical, Jazz, Classic Rock and Hip-Hop), and streaming shows (for which there is negligible lag between audio and visual). First off, these headphones improve the experience of all of these things. I find myself discovering nuances and details in music I am very intimate with. I also find myself, for example) turning my head when a dog barks off in the distance in a show. The sound is very balanced and somewhat neutral for a Sony headphone.

The touch controls are easy and intuitive. The microphone is clear and responsive with no echo or complaint from those on the other end of the line. The noise cancellation has minimal effect on the SQ. The canceling is beautiful. They are excessively comfortable for my larger than average head. These are great.

10 of 10 would buy again. Thinking about a set for my wife and my father.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The headband does become irritating after hours of wearing but that's  really fine. My ears have yet to overheat under these which was my biggest problem with over ear headphones. The sound quality is definitely the best i've experienced. The bass has such a good range reach and can be nearly removed or overpowering depending upon where you set the levels in the app. The touch controls arent my favorite for convenience reasons seeing as they arent perfectly responsive (could just be me not being used to them yet) and I accidentally hit them sometimes, however they do add an amount of class and quality to the headphones. I haven't heard the microphone quality myself but nobody ever has a problem hearing me if I talk via bluetooth on the phone. I do wish there was a voice feedback (or ambient sound turn on) when two way voice is active for phone calls and voice assistance (ex. Google assistant). I dont ever know how loud im talking due to the noise canceling. Noise canceling isn't perfect but according to all tech reviews i've read and watched these have the best noise canceling to date. Sharp sounds such as gunshots, small dogs barking, and like tapping your pen still come through but definitely quieter than they normally are and often are easily overpowered by music. Talking can get through but muffled and often incoherent depending on the volume and distance of the subject speaking again easily overpowered by music. Constant sounds  soft sounds, or low sounds such as highway traffic, trains, cows, neighbors tv, wind, and other are nearly always muted entirely even without music playing.

Overall, they are worth the price and are definitely a good buy if you can afford such.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have the latest Bose version of noise cancelling blue tooth headphones too, I couldn't make up my mind. :-)  So, for rocking out, and listening options, I prefer the Sony.  The app that comes with the Sony is so much better for pure sound.  I am using an iPhone XS Max, and response time for using the app is very good.  The Equalizer in the Sony app is one of the big selling points for me. You can go into manual mode and really dial in your favorite sound, or use one of the presets.  The bose app has no EQ options and that is a real drag.

Today, I wore these in the garage to see how they would compete with a very noisy air compressor and I was totally blown away.  I could actually listen to classical music while the compressor was blasting very near to me.  Taking the headphones off and putting them on a few times just to see it was really that good, and it was.  You may need to use the app to adjust the noise cancelling level depending on your needs, or set it to auto mode.  I also tried it on the riding lawnmower and it is really stunning.  I didn't try the Bose in either situation, no time today, so I can't comment on how well the Bose will block out an air compressor..

The Sony app is not  perfect though.  Every time i open it, it reconnects and its a bit odd, but works well.  also, using the headphones on multiple devices is not very smooth. Fortunately, I have most of my music on my phone.

I do like the tones and the voice of the prompts, some people have mentioned them as a negative, but I'm not one of them.

They are very comfortable, but they feel a bit heavier than the Bose, and some folks may find they sweat easier with these.  So, Bose wins the comfort category.  Also, Bose can connect to multiple devices easier.

I will almost always use these over the Bose for at home use.  But I do find myself wearing the Bose when I am working. The subtle weight difference ( or so it seems ) and the comfort make me prefer the Bose for work.  The sound quality of the Bose is very good, and plenty sufficient for all day listening, which for me is usually classical, or easy listening.

Ah, and I must also comment on the touch controls.  I was very concerned about them not working well, or being triggered by something and annoying me.  But so far they work almost perfectly.  i use the touch option to stop/start music, adjust the volume, and skip to the next song.  It is very cool..  hard to believe that this technology exists today.

Battery life is great too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Packaging, carry case and headphone material quality is amazing and frankly I expect that considering a 350$ price tag.

My honest unbiased review :-

PROS-
1)Great headphone build quality and looks great
2) Lightweight and Less head clamping force- thus can be easily worn for long durations without any headache, ear fatigue, etc
3) Active Noise Cancellation is clearly the best which it endorses. Compared to Bose Qc35, these are better by a clear margin in my opinion. The ANC on these is customizable too according to various environments which I appreciated a lot.
4) Sony headphones app is pretty good with customizable EQ & ANC. Also has preset EQ options and self adaptive ANC setting.
5) USB-type C charging and quick charge options are wonderful.

Now coming to the CONS, and I have some major ones here

1)Sound quality is of prime importance to me ( way more than wireless connectivity and ANC) & sound is the worst thing about these headphones considering the 350$ price. My previous headphones (For eg- ATH-M50xBT sound so much better that I dare compare sound quality.
Basically the Mids & Highs are compromised a lot according to me . there isn't enough clarity and sound muddy especially after 50% volume.

2) Lows and bass which are advertised as great are average and noticed frequent distortion and bass cracking at higher volumes. Has a strong bass but isn't a thumpy bass , rather sound really artificial. Bass was where I was most disappointed.
As much as I appreciate the EQ customizability , no matter how much I played with the EQ settings I couldn't get my desired sound. Even at extreme EQ settings it stays bass heavy (though not satisfying one)
3) Max volume isn't as high as it should be in my opinion, but this may vary with every consumer.
4) Wireless connectivity- connecting bluetooth was smooth BUT I noticed some intermittent connection breaks with my MacBook Air while being in the same room.
5) Touch controls are good but you will experience accidental pressing while trying to adjust the headphones or sometimes wrong function might work. basically takes time to adapt and still wouldn't be 100% accurate. I prefer the mechanical buttons for volume and track change.
6) soundstage is average, have experienced way better in closed over ear headphones.
7) Ear cups are pretty bulky. Don't expect a sleek look. Pop out significantly over ear.

In conclusion as the cons were to bothersome for me especially the sound quality and sound stage, I returned the product. If you are looking for wireless over-ear headphones specifically for the Active noise cancellation and sound doesn't matter much then go for these. But if you are spending 350$ on a headphone , I guess you are entitled to great sound. So I DO NOT RECOMMEND these headphones .","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Excellent battery life and Charge Speed

I had really grown accustomed to entry-level ""audiophile"" over-ear headphones like the Audio Technica M50x but despite their decent passive noise isolation, ambient noise in the subway or walking across the George Washington Bridge sometimes drowned them out.  I wanted a set of more portable, wireless, noise-canceling headphones and read that these struck a good balance.  I did not expect audiophile quality sound.  So let me break it down by categories:

Sound (3-4/5): Decent.  These are not ""audiophile"" grade by any means.  They are pleasant, warm, easy to listen to (not fatiguing), better than most ear buds, decent bass (though it can overlap with low mids), and with the equalizer can be customized a bit to fit your preference.  But compared to audiophile grade they are not as detailed or clear.  Still, for a set of active noise canceling headphones loaded with features, it's a good enough sound for a commute.

Noise-canceling (4/5): Very good.  In some settings it is really impressive and makes the whole world seem to disappear.  Obviously it can't block out unpredictable transient sounds and it won't completely eliminate very loud low frequency rumbles (like the subway) but certainly dampens them impressively.  One disappointment is its handling of wind noise.  Wind sometimes seems to feed into the headphones.  I think this is because the microphones are picking up the wind and failing at canceling it (so it ends up getting transmitted into the headphone).  It's not a fatal flaw and typically not a major problem unless the wind is really strong.  But this is the reason ANC doesn't get 5/5.

Build (4/5):  Although it initially feels like a plastic toy I grew to like the build over the time.  It is light and sleek.  Nothing much to say about it.  I suspect durability could be an issue but haven't had them long enough.

Comfort (5/5): I thought they were very soft and comfortable.  Not too much clamping force.

Controls (2/5): This is the potential fatal flaw.  I would have given this a 1/5 but I do like the concept of the touch controls and when they are working well it is very convenient.  I wouldn't have minded occasional hiccups but here is where the real issue.  On cold and/or windy days, the touch controls were spontaneously activate.  This would cause voice assist to activate randomly or tracks to pause/skip.  It made the headphones unusable outdoors on cold and/or windy days.  In addition, a few times the controls stopped working, then became fritzy.  I had to turn off/on the headphones to get them to work.  This was the most disappointing issue the headphones had.  Many people will want them for commuting which for many involves being outdoors.  This problem essentially renders them unusable for this application.  In normal indoor environments (or airplanes I suspect) they work well.

Other features/misc (5/5):  Loaded with neat features (some useful, some fun).  Decent phone app with equalizer.  Interesting ANC optimization and settings (though sometimes don't work that great).  Great foldability and semi-rigid case make them very portable.

Overall (3/5):  Great for indoor use or warm climates but potentially fatal flaw for those hoping to use them to commute in cold weather.  I will likely have to return them.  Also be aware that fakespot.com grades the reviews with an ""F"" suggesting high deception is involved (in contrast to the ""A"" that the Bose QC 35 II have).  I will may try the Bose QC 35 II despite possibly inferior sound given they have physical controls, are said to be more comfortable, ANC not affected by wind as much, and are also foldable and portable.  Alternatively, I may stick to my M50x or M50xBT or Sennheiser 598cs for better sound quality but no ANC.  The ATH-MSR7 is an intriguing possibility given it combines audiophile level sound with active noise canceling (but I haven't loved the sound signature).","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought my wife the latest Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II's for our upcoming trip to Thailand at the same time as these, because she's, sadly, ""not really into bass,"" these absolutely destroy them, not even a remotely fair fight. Once you spend the time to turn on your best audio setting on your phone, spotify/whatever, the headphones themselves etc... you will hear what they can REALLY do. Out of the box they were pretty good but after maxing out your (in my case) GS10+ phone audio settings, customizing your equalizer settings, turning on the extra goodies in the headphone app... these are the best bluetooth NC headphones imo. I would have regretted the Bose and felt ripped off. To be fair Bose are ok if you just don't care about sound (like my wife) and want to use them as basically, $350 NC earplugs for a flight.

As a noice cancelling and music playing device, it has been excellent. However, there are couple of things that make give it only 4 stars.
First one has been widely discussed. It can only connect to 1 device. It does that really well. The moment I open my laptop it's all ready connected to it. However, switching between devices (for me it's my phone and laptop) is a headache.  Moreover, it really likes connecting to the device it was connected to the last time. So in order to switch sometimes you have to go through holding the button for 2 seconds (which turns it off), and then for another 7 seconds so it's ready to pair up with a new device. Get's quite annoying especially after you have used something like AirPods, earbuds for far less money.
The second thing is that does not turn off unless you disconnect it from bluetooth or manually turn it. In real life what happens is I pack up my stuff to go for lunch or classes, get home 6 hours after and the device has been on all this time. Or it was one the whole night. As a result, the amazing battery life kinda loses its point.
I have been using these headphones for 2 weeks and still might return them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Lamberty","Definitely worth the money!","May 9, 2019","Pairing these with my phone was a breeze, once I read how to turn the headphones on. You have to hold the power button for 2 seconds. The Sony headphone app is easy to use and really helps you understand the different features these headphones have. I broke these in on a five hour flight and they rocked it! They are comfortable and don't weigh a lot. After 4 hours of use, I didn't even realize I was wearing them. The pads do get a little dingy from the oils of our skin though. However, they're user replaceable. The battery life is amazing about 5 hours total of use and the battery was still at 90%. Now onto the meat and potatoes... I fly a few times a year and my ears always hurt afterwards. These headphones did an amazing job cancelling out the noise from flying, my ears didn't hurt. Apparently there was a crying baby a few rows back. I didn't notice. One thing I did notice and is totally worth mentioning is the sound quality difference between wireless and wired. After a few hours of wireless listening to flac files from my phone, I decided to hook up the included headphone wire into my portal amp and dac. The wireless sound quality is decent and kind of muddy, even with playing with the eq. Once I was wired into the amp, the same song as before sounded considerably better. And the noise cancellation worked just as well wireless or wired. The included travel case is a big plus in my book as well. Overall, these are worth the price and a great solution to a noisy environment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, when I'm at the gym with a group of other people (wearing bluetooth headphones) working out in the area, I get a lot of Bluetooth interference.  I can't walk very far away from my phone without experiencing some interference.  If there is not many people in the area the Bluetooth works fine.  I say this because I had no issues ever with the JBL bluetooth headsets.  They were not noise cancelling though.

Furthermore, with respect to lifting, my shoulder hit the side of the headphones, often pausing the music.  Lastly, the headphones randomly shut off for no reason and I don't know why.

They are very tight on the head and the material against the ears gets hot and is uncomfortable.  The controls are also complex and annoying.  Maybe I am getting old, but  I just want simple, decent-sounding, comfortable headphones with good ANC for plane travel and at the office when it is noisy.  These are not that.  I do agree the ANC is better than the Bose.  If the only criterion is ANC, these win.

I'm a law student, only wear them to study, and took perfect care. My usage was about 4 hours/day over the course of a year.  $350 head cans should hold up to that usage. As the ear pads degraded (slowly, they were great for 7 months) the metal audio parts increasingly pushed on my inner ears to the point of being painful.  I was SoL because ear foam pads are considered cosmetic per the warranty.  To be transparent I bought the XM2, the predecessor, and the ear cavity in the xm3 version has been increased, slightly, (in theory it would take longer for degradation to cause ear pain) but when the foam degrades, plastic and metal will be on your ear. I raved about these headphones for months, until my ear pain began.  Look to Bose for better build quality, the sound and noise cancelling are basically the same but with a more premium build-or apple, because their customer service is amazing and probably would have replaced the headphones without questions asked.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_196?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=196&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I know everyone is ranting on about these new headphones, but I just don't think they're worth this price. Why don't these pair with Sony Bravia TV's that are 2017 models or later? Both of these are Sony technologies. Second of all, the headphones feel cheapy, the material, the flimsiness do not justify the cost. Yes the noise cancelling is very nice, but thats really the only thing you're paying $350 for. Sound quality is very decent, but other headphones do match it.

Faygenbaum","Earmuffs with music","August 28, 2019","So, I bought these to compare them to the QC35 II which I already own - and I DEFINITELY cannot live with these. I'll highlight some important points starting with pro's:

Audio Quality:  Decent sound, volume goes higher than the bose, pretty clear even though some distortion with music.

Materials:  Durable feel and premium materials, but unlikely to age well.

Battery life:  Incredibly good, way better than bose. Easier to charge with USB C.

Weight: Not substantially heavier than the bose, but still very light.

- now for the negatives -

Heat:  My biggest and most outstanding gripe, as you may be able to tell from the headline,  is the material and feel on the ear. Simply put, these are full-on earmuffs. The leather quality is clearly synthetic and the cups are less recessed. They make my head sweat and are incredibly uncomfortable for extended periods of time. Bose wins hands down here.

NC controls/quality:  These are inferior in noise cancellation consistency. They are not quieter or more dynamic than the bose in that sense. The settings are far too time consuming to switch from ambient to nc settings. They take roughtly 5 button presses to get to where you want to be.

Call quality: In short, don't use any NC headset for calls. They aren't made for it, its an awful experience for both ends of the call and are absolutely not good for this purpose. Buy a Jabra UC headset and thank me later.

Case: These are much less portable and easy to stow away in the case because they only fold flat in one direction. This means they can only be put in the case in 1 configuration and its annoying to do that on the go.

Device connection: This is purely awful. They connect to literally 1 device, and do not connect or play sound from another unless you manually disconnect the bluetooth settings every time. Impractical and basic for a $400 headset.
--

Bottom line: These are completely inferior in comfort, convenience, and quality to the Bose. I'm not sure why people would think otherwise, but in my opinion, they don't even touch the QC 35's.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_31?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=31&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So here I’ll compare both for those who are thinking of upgrading it (spoiler: it’s not the time to do so)
-build quality: the fine leather cups were replaced by plastic
-tactile feedback: older model is quick/responsive to the taps to play/pause/next... the mk3 has a serious 2/3 of second delay... annoying
+sound: quality of bass improved, but not bizarrely better, no need to upgrade
+battery life: its better, but mk1 was good too.
+tilted speakers inside earcups: adds comfort as ears don’t touch the speakers; but TBH, not a big reason to upgrade
+app integration with options such as having the annoying auto-off feature turned off
-The microphone still doesn’t work for calls. Repeating: The microphone still doesn’t work for calls. It works much better than before, yes... but people still can’t hear clearly, making it impossible to use it, especially in “noisy” environments such as a train.

The sound quality is excellent, and if you use the Headphones app you can change the base and other EQ settings.  The base is good and strong, especially when you turn it up.  When you enable noise canceling and run the optimizer, it is phenomenal!  Voices are not completely canceled, but in most cases they will be muffled and hard to understand. Play music on top of noise canceling, and you won’t really hear anything at all.  I attempted to use these in the dining room which was very loud, and I would say about 90% of the sound was canceled out without playing any music.  I’m not sure how these will handle in the car, but I suspect they should be fine. Wind noise might be the only issue, which isn’t that big of a deal.  They are extremely comfortable as well. Maybe not quite as good as the QC 35 headphones, but very close.  They are a clear step up from last year‘s noise canceling headphones!
 Update.
 The headband is covered in leather and has more Patty. I have not heard of any cracking issues, and the headband feels slightly stronger to me. Also, the swivel pointst feel stronger as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The tactile gesture function makes it very easy to use as opposed to multiple buttons. Sound is amazing - works amazing with high end phones from the last 2 years. Doesn't weigh much. Noice cancelling on another level. Very efficient app to go with it. Oh, and wonderful battery life!

Issues: People with bigger ears might struggle with the comfort of the cups over long durations of use (for me it was quite comfortable and working wonders on a 9 hour flight). My ears did experience heating up, but i dont see this being a major issue in colder climates. Only connects to one device.

The issues are minimal/insignificant compared to the positives. Overall an amazing experience. Definitely beats the bose QC35-II in my opinion.

I honestly figured it was just marketing hype, but it's not! I've never experienced anything like it. No joke, you have NOT experienced true silence until you've worn these! You hear absolutely nothing! It was so calming & peacefully quiet, that I actually fell asleep after about 10 minutes of first having them on & I had just unboxed them!

The audio is smooth, clear & completely distortion free.  I'm using it with a OnePlus 7 Pro via Bluetooth 5.0 & LDAC which is at 32 bit 96Khz & quality of 990kbps / 909kbps. Of course it sounds even better through a wired connection.

I've seen people say that these headphones are useless with an external DAC. I am by no means an expert, but I can tell you from first hand experience, that although these sound absolutely incredible by themselves, a DAC makes a very noticeable difference as well. Some believe that ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) ruins the DAC experience. To me it adds too it noticeably! Just like with regular music, the ANC eliminates all ambient noise, so the only thing you are hearing is the music being played. Same thing happens with a DAC, it makes everything that much more detailed. Honestly, I was amazed at what the xDuoo DSD XD-05 DAC did with the Beats Studio 2 I was using, but after hooking up these new Sony's OMG! I wasn't expecting it too be that overwhelming!

Bottom line, these things are awesome! I was seriously on the fence about buying them, but now that I've actually used them, I am extremely pleased I got them!

They're light weight, very well made, extremely comfortable too wear for long durations. They're loaded with features & even support Quick Charge! (15 mins of charging gets you 5 hours of playback! A full charge will get 30 hours!)

Yes, they're kinda expensive (which is why I got them on the 0% interest, 5 payment installment option. Thank you Amazon!!!), But honestly they are worth every penny!

I've got a pair of Bose Comfort 25s, and the sound quality blow these out of the water at half the price!  Very disappointed.  i would have given it one star, but the ANC *is* quite good.  But not good enough to live with the shoddy sound quality.  Also, I'm not a big fan of the swipe touch volume control; it's very easy to accidentally  forward to the next track.

I have tried so many headphones, I can hardly count.  Sony 1000XM3, BW PX, BW P7 (which I owned for a year and LOVE), Senheiser Momentum, etc etc.  For the last few days I have been comparing my 4 moth old Sony 1000XM3 with the H9i.  I am keeping the H9i and give the Sony’s to my wife.  But read on.  These are great headphones.

Volume
Plenty loud.  No question.

Comfort
Very comfortable but my ears warm up.  But is fine.

Sound
Overall these sound quite good, and will make most people very happy.  But I made the mistake of hearing the B&O H9i, and the Sony’s are going to my wife.
Bass:  The Sony has strong bass (adjustable) that never gives in.  In fact if you LOVE strong bass all the time, get the Sony’s.  However in comparison to the H9i, the Sony is sloppy or muddy.  But you won’t notice unless you get the H9i, so you might not care.
Treble:  Lacking presence and mainly clarity.  You will lose subtly in many songs, but I think a lot of people don’t care so much.

Noise Isolation
Pretty good.  Those around will only hear your music if you have it somewhat loud and the room is quiet.

Touch Controls
I was looking forward to these but even after 4 months of use, I am constantly skipping tracks backward when I meant to lower the volume.  Very frustrating when you are mid-track (starts song over).

Noise Cancelling

I didn't buy there on Amazon because of delivery delay/out of stock situation. But I got them and very happy I did. No, they are not $1,500 wired so-called audiophile headphones. And some of my less expensive sets sound almost as good (like under $100).  But with a bit bass taming EQ (I used the Sony App, but my iPhone apps, Kaiser Tone and Onkyo HF, also work) they can become a fantastic balanced listening experience. Some on other sites say they are congested. Not to my ears. Apart from that, the comfort and convenience factor just makes them a fantastic value. Never owned the M1 or M2, but a friend owned the latter and he return them for the M3. Says he prefers the form factor on the M3s.

After years of chasing my tail, aka the price to performance Holy Grail, I am content with the Sonys and the Jabra Elite t65, which I did buy on Amazon, as the only two pair of phones I need with my IP8+. Yes, I do on occasion use my old iPod/headphone amp setup with a pair on Thinksound On1 phones, and that sounds very good too (and no, not in the audiophile category either). And sometimes I do pull out the customer JH5 I bought a decade ago or so, and they sound very good too (but the custom fit is not as comfy as it used to be. Must be age). But day to day, the Sonys and the Jabras have hit the sweet spot of sound, comfort and BT usability.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_196?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=196&reviewerType=all_reviews"

These have been a major game changer.

There are three sound canceling options. I use the lowest setting when I do need to be slightly aware of what is around me. The second one I honestly hardly use but I could see it used if you're in a quiet setting and don't need the FULL noise canceling (save some battery although it lasts forever). The final option is the noise canceling. I use this option all the time to drown out white noise machines at work, loud students on campus, and any noises at home (TV/dog/laundry/etc). They sound like you stepped into a black hole and all the excess noise is sucked out.

Every single person I have let use them and try the three variations all have a shocked face. You don't understand the level of noise cancelation until you try them.

I do love the features of controlling everything on the side, but I'm not that picky. I will say as a person who wears glasses, they never hurt my face. They're never too tight. I have had two other friends who wear glasses say the same thing.

For me - the price is worth it because I need the concentration.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So I thought to myself: wow, that must be a minor miracle if they can make it more comfortable than xm2! So I bought an xm3. I'm disappointed to report that my ears (the outer part) hurt within half an hour of wearing them. And after two hours it becomes absolutely unbearable.

Wanted a set of cans that had noise canceling and bt. I have a loud mower (exmark lazer). These don’t disappoint. Sound is definitely solid for this price. The 3m wire is cheap and flimsy but it doesn’t matter since I’m only using bt. A long way away from my grados for lossless but these were 1/3 of the price, has Bluetooth, and noice cancellation. I had a set of Bose bt I was using prior but can’t find them so I bought these. The Bose had less sound quality than these and the noice cancellation wasn’t as good. I think I paid more for the Bose as well in 16. If you’re on the fence about these or the Bose I’d get these hands down. Being I just got these I might be honeymooning so if they start to have issues I’ll post more info. Only negative I will say is the flashing led when you turn them on.

If you just want science without any artificial noise, this one would be the best.

I'm not an audio enthusiast. This looked obviously too pricey. Before landing this, I have tried three pairs of noise cancelling headphones less than $80: quite old Audio-Technica, relatively new MPoW, and the latest TaoTronics. I thought that those cheaper ones should work to my ordinary ears. But they didn't. One of the problems was hissing noise clearly heard when NC is turns on, which was really disappointing. On WH-1000XM3, the level of background noise is hardly heard.

My favorite usage is to listen to podcasts when driving. NC gets rid of most of noise. It sounds like ice-skating. I don't have to increase the volume. I use the same volume level as that in a quite office.

Regarding sound quality, to me WH-1000XM3 sounds way better than any other I have tried before.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_37?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=37&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I debated making this purchase for about 4 months.
I read tons of reviews.  Not just from tech reviewers, but from people who actually purchased them.
These headphones fit great.  They are snug enough to be secure, but not so much so to cause discomfort.
The sound quality is stunning.  The music is clear, defined, crisp...gorgeous.
The noise canceling quality is staggering. When I first enabled the functionality, I had to keep taking them off and putting them back on because I could not believe the difference.
I travel a lot and I was giddy to try them.  Wow!  What am amazing difference in the quality of my flight.
There was a crying baby and I only realized it when I saw the parent of said crying child walking them up and down the aisle.
It was kind of cool to see the infant shrieking, but not hearing a sound!
It comes with a plug that allows you to listen to the movies, etc. on the plane.
Whenever I decided to sleep, I did so with no issues. I didn't worry about twisting or breaking the headset because it is sturdy...yet flexible.
The case these come in are great.  It stores the headset easily and neatly tucks into my backpack.
I am glad I treated myself to these headphones.

overwhelming and cannot be tamed w/o severe trade offs. I also experienced some internal noise and distortion anomalies using BT, this in spite of all the sophomoric and mostly useless gimmick-ware in the Headphone Connect app.

Nirvana:
I use a wired connection and the Poweramp Music app instead. The WH1000XM3 ANC still works great in this mode also.

I can get both – excellent ANC AND great sound equal to (if not better), when compared to my beloved old Sony MDR-1R cans.

Caveats:

1- The Headphone Connect app will not function w/o a BT connection (no biggie).
2- The two buttons on the left cup work just fine.
3- The only right cup function that works in this mode is when you “Place your hand over the right ear cup to turn the volume down and deactivate noise canceling for instant conversation.”

This problem of losing other right cup functions (3) can easily be solved by using an appropriate music playing software (Poweramp for  example) and an audio cable with an inline remote (It works). In addition, using a decent inline remote/with mic might solve numerous complaints about the ‘bad’ phone reception’ problem.

I gave the Sony WH1000XM3 a 5 rating because of it’s fantastic noise cancelling,
and because the Sony engineers had the excellent foresight to allow for the above implementation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Bottom line is, if you are looking for multi-purpose, noise-canceling headphones for the office, the Sony WH1000MX3 are NOT the headphones for you; but if you are are an audiophile who is mostly going to listen to music and just wants the convenience of being able to answer calls at the same time, then these are the BEST for you.

None of the three headphones do a good job of blocking out higher-pitched sounds like human voices, which was a big disappointment for me as that is a critical need in my new employers large ""open office"" setup. And the Sonys were the worst of the three. But all three do a great job of blocking out lower-pitched noise like fans, motors, etc.

Listening to music on the Sonys is phenomenal, and that's just using its default equalizer settings. It's rich, detailed, crisp sound that makes you feel like you are in the middle of a first class concert hall performance. There's no comparison between them and the other two, and I'm not even an audiophile. If that's your primary purpose, rest assured these are the headphones for you.

As an office headphone, though, they are lacking. You cannot connect to a computer, only your cellphone. As of this time, they don't use Siri, only Google Assistant and Alexa (I suspect Sony will fix that in a future firmware update). They don't block or even muffle human voices; of anything they made nearby conversations even clearer which makes them more distracting. The feature I was most excited about --  the hand-over-muff to pause music and ""hear through"" to ambient sounds -- turned out not to be all that helpful. As a right-hander, it ties up my right hand the entire time so I can't take notes on whatever I'm being told. Plus, people just seem to need me to move my headphones off my ear for them to believe I'm listening.

The Sony headphones look fairly high-end on the outer surfaces, but they feel cheaply made, especially inside the ear cups and the headband. The ear cups get hot much more quickly than the other two brands (compared all with music and ANC running). Instead of matching the cord colors to the beige-gold headset (or even using a standard white or cream cords), they are black which adds the the chintzy feel (for $350 you kinda expect more attention to detail).

The Sonys do have the best-designed case of all three. Compact, solidly built, has a built-in divider for the cords, has both a handle strap and an outer mesh slip pocket. Unfortunately it is covered in a cheap-looking tweedy fabric that grabs and holds onto dirt, dog hair, etc. if you get the ""beige gold"" headphones like I did, the fabric is a super ugly, chintzy-looking beige tweed that will look dirty within a couple of days.

In the end, the Jabras were the best suited for my needs because of their better noise cancelling of voices; Siri integration; ability to pair simultaneously with a phone and my laptop (note: the Jabras aren't designed to pair with laptops but I got them to by tweaking a few Windows 10 settings -- see my Jabra review for details); and clever convenience features like auto-pause music when removed from the ears and power on/off by simply swiveling the ear cups.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My main frustration is that this information is not stated anywhere on the Amazon page selling this item.  In fact, there is a highlight that these headphones are an Amazon recommended product.  Why would Amazon not mention that this Amazon recommended product does not work on Amazon's signature tablet, the Kindle Fire?

I was upgrading from the Bose Soundlink 2s and was looking for headphones with noise cancellation.

I have to say that I really, really wanted to love these headhphones but could not bring myself to keep them.

-Features-
PROS
-USB C- Huge plus as I dont really have anything that charges with micros USB at this point. So definitely saves me from having to carry a micro USB cable for a single device. USB C is also a more robust connection when compared to micro USB and far less likely to wear out/break
-ANC- The auto noise cancellation in the MX3s is definitely top of the line. The MX3s did a great job at cutting out office chatter and background noise. Realistically when I was playing music as low to medium volume I could not hear a single thing outside of my music.
-Touchpad control- These worked very well, I especially like the cover right earcup to cancel ANC
-NFC pairing- very quick and painless pairing
-Sony MX3 App- The app was very cool with tons of customization possible
CONS
-ANC- The ANC is top of the line but realistically I was not BLOWN AWAY by it when compaired to the Bose QC35 IIs. switching back and forth between the MX3s and the QC35 IIs left no difference between the two that I could discern.
-Only able to pair to one device at a time. This is such a massive shortcoming for a $350 device. Some people will not find this to be a problem, and I must admit that I thought I could work around it. However, after trying them out I simply found this to be unacceptable. I work in an office setting and wear my headphones for give or take 6 hours a day. I have spotify going all day and the full app on PC is simply better suited for navigation. The mobile side works okay but i expect to be able to use the PC side app when I have it available. Couple this with the fact that I do not want to remove my headphones every time I get a cell phone call and the single pairing option is simply not workable for me. ***I did discover two things after some research. First, supposedly you can pair to two devices, one for audio, and another for hands free calling. However, after following the directions several times on sonys webpage I was never able to get this working. Second, you can pair the headphones to a mobile phone and control the Spotify app via you PC. This made the single pairing option much more manageable for me but is still an inconvenience.
-Sony MX3 app- Changing any of the audio settings in the app (base/treble/mids) drops the headphones into a lower bandwidth streaming option. I honestly could not tell a huge difference in audio quality when doing this but still found it disturbing

-Sound-
PROS
-I found the sound to be relatively accurate and warm, however that is about all I have to say that is nice about it
CONS
-Bass heavy- these headphones are really base heavy. This did make the headphones sounds more like a live concert, but I found the base to be muddy and actually drown out the mids and treble with some music I listened to. You are able to turn down the bass in the app but it drops down the quality of your bluetooth connection. On PC I had installed an EQ program and set up a custom profile to tone down the bass. Realistically though this is just extra dicking around that I did not expect with a 350 dollar set of headphones

-Comfort-
PROS
-i did like the fact that these hug your head in a more streamlined fashion, eliminating the Micky mouse look present in previous models
-The cushions on the headband and earcups are very plush and appear that they would hold up to years of daily use

CONS
-Straight up these are not as comfortable as my Bose soundlink 2s or the QC35 Mark 2s. I do not have overly large earls but still found that parts of my ear touched the inside of earcup. Its not like it was crushing my ears but the slight pressure was definitely there. This may sound like a small gripe, but when you are wearing these headphones for extended periods of time you will most likely find this to be an annoyance. These things also get hot unless you are doing absolutely nothing in a relatively cool environment. If the office was abit warmer than normal or I decided to take a walk around the office I could definitely feel the heat building up. Granted, I am normally not moving when wearing these but if I wanted to wear them while traveling and walking these headphones have a very good chance of making your ears sweat.

-Conclusion-
As I said, i really wanted to love these headphones. They are supposedly the latest and greatest, they look good, and have a ton of cool features and upgrades over anything else out there. Unfortunately, after only an hour or two of wearing them I found myself disappointed in them, not something you really want in a 350 dollar purchase. I stuck it out for two weeks and was actively trying to convince myself that these things were as good as everyone was saying they were. I am no music expert but found the sound in these to be very fatiguing and somewhat muddy. While my Bose may sound abit more hollow I have come to enjoy super crisp and punctuated listening across the whole spectrum. Sounds is obviously a very subjective aspect so you may feel differently but I find that my Bose offer a superior listening experience to my ear. The comfort was also a big letdown come from Bose. With my soundlink 2s i would often not even feel them. With the MX3s I definitely felt them and this only exacerbated with extended wear. While not necessarily uncomfortable they simply have a ways to go to dethrone Bose.
TLDR: For me, everything I found is basically the opposite of 98% of the reviews I read and watched on these headphones. I spent weeks trying to tell myself that I must be missing something that everyone else was seeing but in the end failed to change my views on any aspect of these headphones. For me in the end the Bose QC35IIs simply outperform the MX3s in every aspect that matters to me. I can wear my Bose all day without feeling the need to take them off, the listening experience is more pleasurable to my ear right out of the box (dont have to dick around with any EQ settings), and pairing to multiple devices eliminates the workaround pairing options on the MX3. My advice is to just go with your gut, nobody should have to justify shortcoming in a 350 dollar purchase.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Music sounds great off my phone but there is a bit of lag when watching videos off my laptop (surface book 2). The ANC works great and the feature where you cover the right side cup to let ambient sound in works great.
Call quality is terrible, terrible, terrible!
I bought these with the insurance in case the hinges break like the previous models but thats pretty useless since it will not cover that and they will eventually break! What is gonna eventually break these headphones is the way you have to fold them to store in the case. Youll put so much use on the right cup and not the left that it will eventually just break from constant use versus the left side. The cups also swing in and out very easily when you hold them up, making them feel cheap.
For the high price point, look elsewhere, $80 headphones will last you longer, might not sound as good or have the great anc but others will last.
Returned mine after they started cutting out, major miss for sony.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have a horse face and big ears that stick out so i find these more comfortable than the Bose qc3s however they do get pretty warm after a couple hours but they are light weight enough to do chores around the house.  Vacuuming with the noise canceling is pretty sweet.

The sound quality is pretty much what I expected, using the app is a must for different types of music.  My next best wireless headphones are the bluedio ufo2s and with the m3s you can definitely hear parts of the music that you can with the UFOs.  It's also kinda crazy when you watch YouTube because you can hear the slightest distortion or air touching the mic.  Sometimes its annoying but if you listen to asmr these will make your brain melt.

I only kept these over the audiotechnicas due to the comfort factor and the slightly better bass.  Not sure if they are worth twice the price for someone with a normal shaped head.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_36?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=36&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Extremely flawed product.","May 9, 2019","If you have done any research with these headphones you will see that they are top of the line with noise cancelling. This is true, and why they are so popular. However, many of the negatives of these headphones are very true as well. I thought I could adjust to the drawbacks, but it just is not worth it in the end. I wish I would not have put $350 into under developed headphones.
Here is a list in order of importance to me.

Pros:
-Sound quality is great and headphone EQ app is fantastic and underrated feature I was not expecting.
-Noise cancelling is as you would expect, very good.
-Lightweight and mostly comfortable
-Battery life is good, when powered on/off

Cons:
-Biggest con is there is no power-off when not being used. It is true that they will power-off when disconnected for 5 minutes from a source, but if you don't deliberately turn them off/on (and frantically keep checking) these things will stay on til 0%. Often my phone will remain connected to them for long periods of time even after use.

-Another huge con is the inability to make phone calls. They are practically unusable without a firmware update, which will likely never come as it would have already. Basically, the headphones are capable of picking up ambient noise through external mics and amplifying it is the headphones. This is a feature to allow you to hear external noise with noise cancelling enabled on occasion. However, this feature is forced on for every phone call. I mean unless you are in a completely silent area, there is no hope of hearing the person on the phone. It makes them completely and absolutely worthless for a phone call, which for a pair of $350 headphones should not be excusable.

-It is a chore to switch between which devices are connected to them. I quickly got to the point where I would just turn Bluetooth on/off completely on my phone or computer and just cycle power on the device to get them powered to the correct device. It is hard to explain the annoyance this is. My laptop will be closed and if it was the last device connected, I will have to open it back up, disable bluetooth, then close it again if I want any chance of getting my phone to connect.

-Their weight is comfortable, but they do not breathe at all. I could wear these for long periods of time if they did not get so hot around the ears. Even in cooler environment I have the same issue. My ears will get sweaty and it will be a huge relief to take them off. Don't even try working out with them. I tried a couple times and it is not worth it.

-Touch controls are simply awful. When they work it feels a little cool, but a majority of the time they do not, even with practice. I fear touching the control to increase the volume of a good song because it is a 50/50 chance it will just skip to the next song no matter how deliberately I try to not swipe forward. What is worse is you normally have to swipe multiple times to increase the volume more than a couple notches. That is, unless you perfectly swipe and hold the volume. I just get my phone out basically every time. That being said, it is easy to skip forward a track.

-The blue LED on the headphones flashes at basically random times every time you interact with the headphones. There is no setting to change this. This might seem nit-picky, but it will easily completely light up a dark room for no reason. I mean honestly if it would have a subdued LED and remain on as long as the headphones were on, that would help with the no auto-off issue. It got so annoying I opted to just cover the LED with tape.

I really wanted to like these headphones, but since the only redeeming quality is sound quality and noise cancelling, that should be the only thing you expect to get with your $350. With other headphones on the market with more advanced and also more basic features than these headphones, it makes you believe Sony put out an underdeveloped product and just ripped off their customers.

I would not recommend this product to anyone.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Immediately after opening the box, and charging them, I took a walk into New York City. I adjusted the settings to noise cancelling, and then hit the play button of my music player. An audible ""wow"" came out of my mouth while walking with a crowd.

As with all noise cancelling headphones, it doesn't completely eradicate all sound, But I would say a solid 90% of the sound fades away. Especially the wind brushing sounds of passing cars. In my walk, I had moments where I had forgotten I was walking in the city and back at my apartment.

Sound quality is excellent for a pair of wireless headphones. The accompanying app is great to customize how much sound you want to come through using a scale of 0-20. Zero indicates the least amount of sound to come through.

Open palm to lower the volume of your music, and allowing sound to come through is great to use in the workplace, but will remain being awkward. However, I really enjoy it, and will continue being awkward. Down with the social norms!

Overall, the only problem I see with the earphones is during the summer. Around your ears will sweat, but my ears themselves have been all right so far. Since it's fall right now in the US at the time of this review, it's perfect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The ANC and sound quality is incredible!
Material quality is fair, lots of plastic to save wheight and lots of leather padding for comfort.
If your comparing these to the Bose qc 35 2
The Bose has the lead in comfort hands down. The Sony's are comfortable but not as close as the Bose. Sound quality is similar and only noticeable when comparing the tow side by side. The Sony has the lead there. ANC is great on both but slightly better on the Sony's. Durability and longevity goes to the Bose, they feature changeable earcups while the Sony's are fixed to the headphone itself. Overall the Sony's is an excellent choice for listening for about 30 minutes at a time before having to take a break from ear sweat. For long sessions for more than an hour go for the Bose.

Mangano","Equalizer only works with phone","September 3, 2019","Unless you're paired with your phone, you get stock sound quality. When paired with my Mac or anything other than my iPhone, there is no equalizer access. This causes the sound to be very bass-heavy and otherwise unbalanced. In other words, the adjustments you make in the app do not carry over to other devices or even, from what I can tell, to your next use after turning the headphones off.  I've also had some hiccups with the noise canceling, where the feature, that allows outside noise in, will turn on without touching the headphones.
I didn't think it was a big deal that these only connect to one device at a time, but it turns out to be a giant pain in the @$$.
I also have the Bose NC-700 and they are tuned very nicely. Not as much boom, but no equalizer necessary and consistent sound across devices.
These Sonys would probably have 5 stars from me, if not for these issues. I'm not sure why youtubers and reviewers go so nuts over these when there are such major issues that the competition has already taken care of.

So comfortable, noise cancellation is legit the best I've ever experienced (FYI - haven't tried out the Bose 700's to have anything to add concerning that one), sound quality is pretty good (I really had to experiment with the EQ in the app in order to get the sound profile in a place I was comfortable with), and I really can't stress enough on how good that noise cancellation actually is.

No regrets, at $298 these headphones are a no brainer.  I may sound biased towards these cans, but I'm no kidding currently wearing these at this very moment and they sound incredible after they've been broken in.

What I appreciated most about the noise cancelling ability of these was that I did not need to crank my music to max volume in order to assist in cancelling out noise.  The fit, ANC tech as well as volume all are well tuned to allow for ANC.
--Fit: SUPER comfortable.  Cant emphasize it enough.
--Touch controls: very responsive and work as advertised.
--Battery life: I have never used these long enough to truly test the 30hr battery life claim.  However I had an 18hr flight in which I used these multiple times for 3-4hr stretches.  Definitely had 80-85% battery life left after all that usage.  Mind you this was with ANC at 100%.
--Packaging: the carrying case is very durable without being too bulky.  Easy to put the headphones away.

I ended up returning the Sony headphones. Here is my comparison of the two:

- Both have very good active noise cancellation (ANC)
- Both have good sound, although the Sonys probably have more base, which I personally liked
- Both come with an app you can install on your phone to configure them to an extent. The Sonys are more configurable, with an EQ and more granular noise cancellation.
- The Sonys have an adaptive noise cancellation feature that will change the ANC level based on where you are and what you are doing (e.g., sitting vs traveling). I personally don't care about this feature or find it that useful.
- I found the Bose to be more comfortable and easier to fold up put away. The Sony earpads weren't as soft, and the headphones clamped down on my head with more pressure.
- I found the Sonys to have more intense ANC overall. My ears are sensitive to ANC, and I get the feeling of having pressure in my ears with ANC enabled. That feeling was much less intense on the Bose, even on high, despite the Bose having very good ANC, which gave me the impression that the Sony ANC was more brute force and less accurate.
- The Sonys have neat touch controls for volume, play/pause, prev/next, etc. While it's a cool feature, it wasn't something I cared that much about, and I was often worried I was going to accidentally change something when taking the headphones off and on. I don't think the buttons on the Bose headphones detract from their looks.

Ultimately I returned the Sony headphones because I found the Bose to be more comfortable. My biggest gripe about both pairs of headphones is they do not save your last ANC setting! I cannot believe this feature was overlooked. I don't plan on using ANC all of the time. If I turn the ANC to low or completely off, when I turn the headphones off and on again, it will reset to high. The Sony app even allows you to configure the ANC at a granular level and allows you to configure the ANC for different usage patterns when the adaptive ANC is on; however, those settings also didn't persist, making them basically useless. I found the Sony Android app to be pretty buggy in general. I would strongly prefer an actual physical switch for the ANC setting instead of just having the setting be software controlled.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Fantastic headphones! But missing USB-C Cable and crappy Sony support.","October 19, 2018","These headphones are very good and have by far the best audio fidelity and noise canceling of any NC headset I have ever owned, approaching (though still not quite reaching) that of professional studio headphones. And they are comfortable to wear for hours on end. The noise canceling is very effective, even on commercial flights. The bluetooth is very stable and I have experienced no audio quality or disconnect issues as I have with other bluetooth headphones and earbuds.  And the battery lasts me a couple weeks and you can easily check battery levels by tapping the power button twice - battery level is reported via headphone audio.
One additional surprise was the great sound quality in both directions when making calls. I never could use my previous Bose and Sony NC headphones for phone calls. My job has me on several conference calls daily with most lasting 60 to 90 minutes and previous NC headphones would have poor audio quality with folks on the other end having difficulty hearing me, or the audio would cut out intermittently. Not so with Sony’s latest model. Audio in both directions is stable and FM DJ clear and strong. Instead of complaining they can’t hear me, I now get asked what headset I am using because the audio is noticeably better than others on the call.
So, with all those positive comments, why only 4 instead of 5 stars? Because Sony packaged them without the USB-C charging cable and would not provide the obvious remedy of shipping me one. I received the headphones the day of an evening cross-country flight. This is my first USB-C device so I had no cable to charge them and they arrived with no power. The manual and box both said the cable was included, and the headphone case even has a special pocket for it. The box arrived new, unopened from Amazon still wrapped in factory plastic, and Amazon was the seller and fulfiller. I could not even use my new headphones as I had no way to charge them and a long flight quickly approaching. I ended up buying a cable at the airport for way too much markup.
I could have returned the headphones to Amazon and waited for another set, but that meant traveling without them for this trip. Having bought my own cable, I was still owed one and figured Sony would gladly send me the missing cable for my inconvenience. Manufacturers usually prefer handling issues this way versus a full retail return which is more costly for all involved. Sony’s response follows and is why this review has a 4 rather than 5 star rating.
“We really wish we could help you. We at email support deal with basic troubleshooting steps. We request you to contact the Amazon support team. We are positive that they will help you.”

2018-11-16 EDIT: I recently switched to an iphone without a headphone jack. When used over Bluetooth for conference calls, I do get frequent complaints that folks cannot hear me. Wired, these headphones are xcellent for conference calls. Over Bluetooth for conference calls they are, unfortunately, mediocre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But now that I bit the bullet I have absolutely no regrets.  Definitly worth the money!!!

Sound quality.
Absolutely amazing.  These deliver robust lows, great mids,  and very crisp clear highs.

Noise canceling.
I had no idea how much ambient noise was in my office until i put these on and turned them on.  The is the most silence i believe i have ever heard.  On a plane you can still faintly hear the noise of the engines but definitely filters out most of the sound.

Controls
The controls on these are top notch.  There is only two buttons but one whole side it touch sensitive and uses gestures to control the functions.  Very creative and easy to use.

App
The application for the phone works well and very easy to use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_26?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=26&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Nelson","Superb investment for knowlege workers","October 6, 2018","I'm sorry to say, but these Sony WH-1000XM3 wireless, noise-cancelling headphones have replaced my Sennheiser Momentums as daily wear. It's not because they sound better, but they're **almost** as good, and the noise-canceling is so fantastic I can't go back. The wireless is a bonus.

I use these headphones from my Acer laptop running Linux, or alternately from my Samsung S7 Android phone, both over bluetooth. I write code, all day, every day, usually from my home office. I wear these headphones for at least eight hours a day. I use them for video-conferencing, music (mostly Gregorian chant, some EDM, whatever) and occasional podcasts (when drudgery-coding).

An added use-case for these headphones is just sitting in silence. That turns out to be pretty danged amazing for intense coding sessions. When my kids start practicing piano in the room next to the office I simply cannot work without some kind of ear protection. I previously wore industrial ear-muffs.

These noise-cancelling headphones actually reduce noise (specifically piano practice) volume even more than a pair of Sellstrom HP431 premium ear muffs rated at 31db. And the Sellstroms are so uncomfortable I can only wear them for an hour at a time. The Sonys are so comfortable I can wear them all day every day. And because they're wireless I often just wander around the house with them still on my head and I don't even realize the family is calling me. I live my life now in a blissful cone of silence. Ahhhhh...

Regarding battery charge times. I intentionally tested them by disabling auto power off (using the app, see below) and running them down to the ""battery low"" warning, then charging them for 20 minutes. A 20 minute USB2.0 charge (at 0.5A) provided 4 hours of listening time. I did this test twice and got the same result both times. Other than that intentional test, I charge these overnight every couple days and have never run them down in the course of a full day's use.

Positives: excellent audio quality. Incredible noise cancelation. Superb comfort. Wireless.

Negatives: microphone quality for voice conferencing is decidedly sub-par. I use my external USB mic for all calls, so this defect doesn't affect me. But if you expect to use these headphones for making phone calls, definitely try before you buy.

Tips! After using these headphones for a few weeks, I have some tips:

Phone App! Install the app called ""Sony Headphone"". You need it to change some settings, including the equalizer.

Equalize! I find the default settings to be far too bassy, stupidly boomy. There are six equalizer presents, none of which are to my taste. My preferred settings are to drop the 400Hz bar to -3, and put the Clear Bass setting at -1. This makes the Sonys sound almost as good as my Sennheiser Momentums.

Volume Swipe! Control the volume with your finger. The volume of the headphones can be turned up or down with a finger slide on the exterior of the right ear-can. If volume is too low (as mine was, at first) be sure to swipe-up repeatedly to maximize the volume to its highest level. You'll know when your at full max when you hear two beeps.

Blueman! For Linux users (I'm running Mint 18.3) my built in bluetooth settings application didn't work. To use these headphones with my Acer Linux laptop I had to install a superior ""Bluetooth Manager"" program, which worked much better. To do this (in Ubuntu or Mint), just run `sudo apt-get install blueman`. Also, after pairing and connecting, be sure to set the device to ""Digital Stereo"" mode, not ""Headset"" and not ""Handsfree."" The latter two sound like a tin can.

Hey, get this! The super cool song in the Sony marketing video is available on youtube for free. Be that guy! Just search for ""Sam Fischer x TheGifted - Restless (Official Audio)"". Sweet, sweet tones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_196?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=196&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The sound and noise cancelling are great as many other reviewers observe.  For me, I didn't like the feel of the ear cups after about 40 minutes.  They were a little to small, but what I really didn't like was the feel.  They were kind of a cheap plastic that didn't breath like leather, which competitors offer, albeit at a higher price.

I was prepared for some sort of compromise, even at this price, but there's practically none at all. The noise canceling, as you've probably read, is great. But I want to emphasize the sound quality... it's simply stupendous.

My first reaction to the sound was ""yech"", actually, because they sounded so different from my wired headphones, the Sony MDR 7506. Compared with those, the WH-1000XM3 initially sounded ""muddy"" to me and I was ready to box 'em up and send 'em back. But after listening to them for a couple of days they grew on me tremendously, and I had to admit that I was really just accustomed to the sound of my MDR 7506, and after taking time to adjust, the WH-1000XM2 actually sounded way, way better. Way better.

I also have a pair of Sennheiser HD6XX 'phones paired with a Schiit DAC and amp stack, and truly, the Sonys are not a really noticeable step down.

I wear the Sonys at work, and can listen to them for hours at a time with no discomfort. I can't overstate how amazing these are. Just get them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_39?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=39&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Good news, it works perfectly for listening to music- on my phone, and exclusively on my phone.

On my PC, I originally couldn't get it to work at all. Then slowly but surely I got the headphones to work at horrendous quality. Like worse than AM radio quality. I bought a physical bluetooth transmitter (instead of the integrated one on my motherboard that works perfectly fine for everything else) and tried using that. Some more piddling to get that to work and I finally get to the point where I can listen to a youtube video. I already feel some latency so I take an audio reaction time test. Average reaction time: 400ms. Just to scale, on my usual headphones it's under 200ms. I change the codec (using the phone app, since there doesn't seem to be a different way to change it) and it only seems to go down to APTX. Regardless, I try it again and get slightly less latency. Still essentially unbearable for playing games and makes watching videos feel shitty. The sound was great besides the buzzing white noise that never seemed to stop. I've now worked on fixing these headphones for 6+ hours and bought a wireless transmitter that just makes them usable. I really wanted to like these headphones; they look nice, my music sounds good on them and they're super comfy but I can't justify almost $400 (more if you count the bluetooth transmitter) for a product that I can't play games with.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I travel for work quite frequently and have been wanting a pair of noise cancelling headphones for quite some time. Like most, I was between the Bose QC35 ii's and these Sony WH-1000xM3s. I visited a local store and tried out both. My initial conclusion was that the Bose cans are more comfortable (lighter, deeper ear cups), but with weaker NC and a more neutral sound signature. I ended up ordering the Sony's and now have used them for 3-4 hours/day since receiving them.

Build Quality/Materials - Initial thoughts upon unboxing - these are solid. The soft touch plastics used feels durable and of good quality.  These do not feel cheap to me whatsoever. The detents on the headband are well defined and feel like they'll hold up to daily adjustment. Sufficient padding on the headband as well. The ear cups are well padded and the synthetic leather feels of high quality. No creaking or odd sounds when flexing these way past what normal on/off the head use subjects them to. Only time will tell how these hold up to daily use, but I'm happy with the build quality out of the box.

Fit - I have a large head. I wear a size 7-5/8 fitted baseball cap. My longest continuous listening session with these thus far was ~4 hours. No major discomfort to report. I had no fatigue along my jawline from the ear cup clamping force, and zero discomfort along the crown of my head. I will say, my ears/head get warm with these on for extended periods of time, even while stationary. When moving around the house, I started to sweat a bit. I do tend to run hot but regardless, these are a warm set of cans. I do think these will be just fine for stationary use (such as on a plane) and that's how I intend to use them 95% of the time.

Noise Cancellation - One word: Wow. As mentioned above, this is my first pair of headphones with noise cancellation. I fly a lot for work and wanted the best of the best in this category. My old Sennheiser HD 429s, which are over ear/closed back, but have no noise cancellation, only really drown out ambient noise when listening at 80+% volume, which is not ideal for hours long flights. After watching the numerous comparison review videos on YouTube, and trying both the Bose QC35 ii's and these cans in store, I feel I made the right choice. The noise cancellation is truly remarkable. The quick attention feature works great as well. I can cover the right ear cup and ambient noise/voices become almost immediately audible. I've tried the Ambient Sound Mode around the house and I will say, that even with ""Focus on Voice"" selected, I have a hard time hearing someone speaking to me if the music volume is above ~20%. I have a flight next week and will amend this section of my review after with my thoughts on the NC on a plane.

Sound Quality - I've been leary of bluetooth headphones for fear of sound degradation due to the wireless connection. My iPhone 8 Plus doesn't have a headphone jack and I've been forced to use the dongle to listen to my Sennheisers, which is less than ideal. After my first listening session with the Sonys, I can confidently say that to my untrained ears, the 1000xM3s absolutely blow my wired Sennheisers out of the water in terms of sound quality. Yes, these are 3x the cost, but I'm still incredibly impressed with the sound quality here. As others have mentioned, these were a bit bass heavy for my tastes out of the box. However, the Sony Connect app gives full EQ control over the sound profile of these cans. In my opinion, the user control available in the app truly pushes these headphones to the next level. Everyone's musical preference is different, and you have full control of the sound with this app. I'm all over the place with my music - from progressive jazz such as Pat Metheny, to the fast and furious riffs of Mastodon, to the undulating bass lines of Flamingosis and Jazzinuff. These headphones deliver! The bass is punchy (and heavy at the upper EQ levels), mids and highs come through prominently and clear, and the soundstage is spot on for my ears.

Pairing & Battery Life - After unboxing, I powered on the headphones and connected them to my iPhone. Pairing was quick and painless. Battery life was at 60% out of the box. I plugged them into a 5V, 1.5 amp power adapter for 10 minutes, using the included USB-C cable, and the headphones were bumped up to 80% battery level. It seems the quick charge claims of 5 hours playback in 10 minutes of charge are valid. I've since listened to them for a total of ~15 hours, and the battery level is showing 30%. The battery level changes in 10% increments. So for my use case, 50% battery loss over 15 hours of listening = 30 hours assumed playback with a full charge. Bang on to Sony's claims. All of my listening has been with Noise Cancelling active, and anywhere from 30 - 70% volume. I'll top these up to 100% battery prior to travelling and will report back with observed battery life for a full charge.

Included Accessories - The carrying case is what I expected. I see it holding up to travel just fine. The internal cable pocket is a bit tight but fits the included cables without much fuss. The included USB-C cable is shorter than I'd like, but seems to be of good quality. The included 3.5mm cable has a straight male connector at one end (for connection to the headphones) and a 90 degree connector at the opposite end. It's an acceptable length.

Other Notes - I've yet to make or receive a phone call with these on. One of the most talked about negatives, at least in the reviews I've read, is how poor the microphone quality is on these headphones. I don't ever plan to take phone calls with these on, so this was never a factor in my purchasing consideration for these. But, I'm sure at some point I'll test out the mic and will report back. Lastly, single device connectivity - I only ever listen to music from my phone so this is another non issue for me. Just to try it out, I did switch listening from my phone to my laptop, and it took maybe 45 seconds to disconnect from one device, connect to the other and then start playing music again.

In conclusion, I'm VERY impressed with these headphones. The noise cancellation is top notch, sound quality for a music enthusiast (read: NOT an audiophile) is excellent, the Sony Connect app is feature rich and gives the user full control, the carrying case is sufficient/in line with other headphones of this class and the build quality is great as well. Only time and use will tell how these hold up in the long run, but so far, these are hands down the best headphones I've ever had the pleasure of owning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I initially bought the Bose due to the slightly better reviews.

Sony vs Bose
Ultimately both the Sony and Bose headphones have great sound, noise-cancellation, style, and work well with your smart assistant. However, where the Bose fell short for me was in the bass department. It had none. I felt something was missing with all of my music while using the Bose.  I listen to a lot of EDM music while I code (don't judge me) and without good bass you just can't get into the zone, ya feel me?

All about that bass
The Sony WH1000XM3 on the other hand has amazing bass. Even better is that the Sony Connect app allows you to adjust bass levels and has an equalizer to adjust music settings to your liking. It also has a setting to mimic different environments such as putting you at an outdoor concert, concert hall, or in the middle of a club. This is a great option and really lets you experience the same music in multiple ways. The Sony app also has sound positional control as an additional setting. The Bose app does not have any options for customization, what you hear is what you get basically.

One feature that the Bose wins on is connecting with two devices simultaneously. With the Sony you will have to disconnect from your current device before connecting to another one. It's not a big deal to me, but some people really like that feature about the Bose.

Final Verdict
I ended up keeping the Sony and returning the Bose. The Sony WH1000XM3 ultimately gave me a better experience with my music and more importantly it gave me the power to adjust music to how I wanted to hear it. Algorithms are great at automating a lot of things, but not when it comes to personal music preferences. Sony made the right choice by leaving it up to the end user.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If the temperature goes below freezing, the touch controls go crazy - registering random clicks/gestures, muting your music, starting up the Google assistant, and then not responding at all to your actual gestures.

The headphones are nice, but you really can't use them anywhere remotely cold. And the worst part is that the touch controls aren't necessary (I don't use them at all because they're not responsive enough even at room temperature), but there is no way to disable them in the app.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sound Quality is paramount for me, and I love the customization from the supplemental app you can use as an equalizer, and this product does not skimp at all.  It catches details in songs I've known for years, which I've never heard. I love these things.

Comfort is another factor, as I typically get headaches from anything on my head from hats, to other headphones. I can honestly say these are very comfortable for extended use even with a giant noggin such as mine.

A word of caution to anyone looking to use these during athletic endeavors, (e.g., at the gym or running): if you plan on using these while working out, beware of the wider headband fit on this model causing these things to slip off your head with too much movement.

Durability hasn't been tested much as I put these things in their included hardcover case as soon as I stop listening to music. They are plastic, which certainly helps with keeping these things lightweight, but I worry how these things would fair if I gave them an actual drop to the pavement from 6 ft in the air.  I think they would survive but may easily scratch or crack somewhere.

Noise-cancelling is nearly unparalleled from all other headphone models I have tested against (Bose, AKG, Jabra, Seinhauser, etc.)

Controls/ Interface- There is a bit of a learning curve with the touch-sensitive design of the controls, but otherwise straightforward. The Google Assistant is a fun feature (when it works), and the ""hand-cupping"" gesture to turn off the noise-cancellation is excellent in a pinch.

If you are teetering on whether to buy them, DO IT as after literally weeks of comparing spreadsheets and paneling friends like the nerd I am, I kept coming back to these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's exactly where the headphones were pressing and spread into my scalp area too. Not fun. I went to the dermatologist and she confirmed my suspicion that it was these headphones that gave me an allergic reaction. Lots steroid creams. First allergic reaction to anything besides poison ivy.

I was bummed because I LOVED these for both my morning NYC train commute as well as my video editing at work. It blocked out all the loud sport talk from my friends and helped me focus.

These headphones are not worth the $300+. Maybe I had a lemon but let me tell you a few reasons why these are not worth the buy.
1. The Bluetooth is choppy and interferes with the audio. I would take them with me to the gym and whenever I would lift weights my music would not play.
2. Forget about wearing these with a hoodie. The touch controls are so sensitive that my hoodie would pause the music.
3. They are very fragile. Any accidental drop will brake these. I have audio Technica m50x and those have lasted me year's. I've dropped them sat on them and bent them and they are still kicking till this day. The Sony's feel like any wrong twist will brake them.

If you are in the market for good headphones that are going to last you long then I suggest getting the m50x Bluetooth version.

These were everything I wanted and more, and I was so proud of this purchase.

Unfortunately, after only two months, I noticed a small stress crack where the right ear cup meets the headband. I was bummed, but thought it was no big deal because I hadn't abused the headphones in any way, and surely Sony would stand by the one year warranty. Nope.

Sony stated that any physical damage isn't covered, even though the warranty states it only does not cover damage incurred outside of normal use. The headphones are pristine other than this small crack and obviously haven't had any damage. I disputed the findings and was still told they would not be covered.

After 6-7 years the battery began to suffer and then, my brother in law forgot his Sony M3's in my car after a recent family road trip. Basically, I tried them on and immediately thought this is the answer to all my problems at work.

 The noise cancelling is at least 5 times as good as the aforementioned Bose. The sound quality is immersive. Comfort level 10/10. The case is nice and I feel they are well protected when not in use.

Note for adjusting your EQ. I am a hobbyist guitarist for 30 years. Mostly acoustic and classical but I can do metal, rock and blues. I have rap, and many genres in my collection, so I did some testing. I turned the iTunes EQ OFF. In the Sony app, I set the EQ to treble boost and turned the Bass slider up to 65% approximately. The headphones are naturally bass heavy , so this leveled it out to a more neutral , slightly higher treble and overall brighter default setting. Although I will mainly be using these for the noise cancelling at my office, the music sounds incredible for the price point.

I have a home office that I am reluctant to work at due to the kids bouncing around. Putting these on allows me to focus there when I need to. Well worth the cost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Comfort: Bose is ahead by a small margin

Electronics: While most prefer Sony, I prefer Bose. The extra features that Sony has are frivolous, IMHO. More important, I like the fact that I can simultaneously connect my IPad and my phone to the device. Can't do that with the Sony

Noise Cancellation: Sony is better. Surprising, but true

Sound Quality: This was the reason that made me return the losing headphones. I very much prefer the open back system that Bose uses vs the closed over the ear Sony cans (which could sometimes result in standing waves). Besides that, Sony sound is more clear and encompasses a wider range than Bose (assuming that both use the same codec). However the big, big difference is in that with Sony, I can use much better codecs (like LDAC). This, to me, makes a huge difference in sound quality. Enough for me to return the Bose and keep Sony.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_196?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=196&reviewerType=all_reviews"

ANC works very well. The noise from environment is effectively suppressed. The adapter in the package is very useful if you try to watch a movie on the plane.  The sound quality may not be as good as the best audiophile level ones, but it is surprisingly better than I expected. My only complain is that it may not feel comfortable for someone with bigger ears like me at first. However, after wearing it for a while, seems I can get use to it.

The foam in the pads push back a little and after only 15 minutes it causes a slight sting of pain. If wearing nearly an hour the top of the head band has a pinching feel either due to the band being too narrow or the top band foam being too stiff.

However sound and features are great, battery life second to none, and a great balance of base and adjustability makes it sound how you want. I really wanted to love these but I can only come away saying that their just fine. To reading on a couch the touch controls are too sensitive and register unattended swipes or presses. For someone with big ears (and head) these never disappear off my head and for multiple hours of use in one session these are just distracting which is unlike what noise cancelling headphones are supposed to accomplish.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_43?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=43&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I like most things about these headphones. There is one glaring issue that has caused me to write this review. There is no TRUE multiple device connection. Sony is very deceptive on this issue in that they have a link describing how to link to multiple devices, however, what they are describing is connecting the media audio from one device and the call audio from another device.

If you want to switch media audio from one device to another, you first have to disconnect the bluetooth on the first device and then connect it to the second device. If you are using your phone and computer this becomes an issue that arises multiple times per day. If I have the headphones connected to my computer and I close it before disconnecting, the link still stays active and I have to reopen the computer to turn off the bluetooth in order to listen to audio from my phone.

As most people switch back and forth between devices multiple times a day this becomes a huge hassle and makes what should be a seamless transition a huge pain point. I thought that Sony would fix this or I would have returned the headphones. I do not believe that the have any plans to do so. If you read the many comments on this issue on Sony's own forums and their total lack of a response other than stating that they will pass this on on someone else, you will see that they have no plan to fix it.

It's sad since these could be fantastic headphones.  If you don't switch between devices, they are, but I'm not sure how many people will use them for only one device.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Every review I read sung their praises, and I'm something of an audiophile so I was excited to pick them up.  However, after using them on and off for a bit, I'm returning them and for me they aren't an upgrade.

If you've read the other reviews here and elsewhere, you can get a pretty good idea of what' makes these great.  But I'm going to quickly highlight the few things I didn't like in case it's helpful:

Build - While they are indeed smaller/lighter than the 2nd gen, they feel a bit cheap/pasticy.  I think they were trying to compete with Bose and the lightness does make them more comfy (though I never found the 2nd gen uncomfortable) but they don't feel like they are a $350 headphone to me.  I also thought the 2nd gen had a bit of flare with their textured ear-cups.  The 3rd gen just blend in to the crowd and look boring.

Audio - This was one of the celebrated improvements but to me I think they sound worse.  The 2nd gen had a good amount of bass (more than I needed) but I thought it was balanced.  (I preferred the sound of the B&W PX, but found them uncomfortable to wear.)  With the 3rd gen, I feel like the bass is just too much.  Things sound muffled and the lows are significantly over-accentuated for my tastes.  As I mentioned above, I have audiophile tastes and so I'm more interested in detail, soundstage, etc.  Obviously, many folks like them based on the reviews. I could EQ the sound, and have played with that but a) then you can't use LDAC and b) I don't want to have to do that to enjoy headphones this expensive.

Controls - This is a minor point really, but the controls generally seem less responsive.  One concrete example is switching between NC, ambient, and off modes with the toggle button.  On my 2nd gen, I could quickly double-tap to get to the setting I wanted, but not with the 3rd gen.  Beyond that, changing volume, play/pause, all seem a bit laggy to me.

Beyond that, there are things that are great here.  Noise Cancelling - top notch.  Battery life - amazing.  Comfort - great.  So, I'm not saying they are bad.  But the above are enough that I think the 2nd gen are the way to go for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We are in 2019 and for whatever reason, they still haven't upgraded these to Bluetooth 5.0 (which is a major upgrade from Bluetooth 4). It's behind the times. Catch up Sony, or someone else will.

I give your style department 5 stars though. Super sexy model. Happy that it is USB-C (rather than cheap micro like Bose). The swiping is fun, effortless, and cool. The hand-over for ambient noise is awesome and great for conversation.

Unfortunately, I am returning these for two reasons:
-No Bluetooth 5.0 (C'mon it's 2019)
-Super Sweaty (With Bose QuietComfort my ears didn't sweat at all...Pay attention to your over-ear design)","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Although this product is amazing, I was debating whether or not to give a lower review just based on shipping speeds. It took me 1 to 1.5 months or receive this item when I even paid for 1 day shipping. Problems with shipping aside, this pair of headphones are amazing.

Although I am not an audiophile by any means, to me, the sound quality is superb (the sound profile fits me better than the QC's) and the noise cancelling is the best I have experienced out of the competing headphones.

While the noise cancelling and sound is excellent, this headphone isn't without it's faults.  The app is absolutely horrendous, which is why I stay away from it. Although I appreciate the gesture of adding an EQ to further change the sound signature of the headphones, it is quite gimmicky and requires me to keep the app open. In addition, the ability to connect only one device at one time is very annoying. I thought it wouldn't be much of a nuisance, but after a month or two of using the headphones, I realized how much of a hindrance it is.

It is very nice that the headphones can charge using USB-C, but it is sad that it is not possible to listen to music while charging unless I am plugged in using an additional 3.5 jack cable.

All in all, however, the updates from the 2nd edition to this one, in my opinion, pushes this pair of headphones ahead of it's competitors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_39?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=39&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I did A LOT of research and already knew the negatives on this (can't pair multi device, high latency so not good for video/audio sync for movies/games, gesture control issues in the cold).

So first off, I found the sound not that crisp and soundstage not super grand like others commented, but after using it a few hours I find the sound is clearing up and less muddy so I'm either getting used to it OR it's already breaking in (although that happens after 30+ hours usually) and you start to get used to it (if you're switching between different high fidelity headphones you're likely to hear clear differences, but if it's your main one, you get used to the sound signature).

The multi-device pairing I didn't think would be an issue for me cuz I'd mainly use it at work on my laptop however, I had it paired to my laptop last night. The laptop was in sleep mode in my bag. This morning I grabbed my phone to use the headphones and it would simply not connect. So I had to do like a reset bluetooth connection. I found that supremely annoying, because I don't see myself switching devices all that often but I figured a laptop in sleep mode would let me prioritize my phone bluetooth connection.. WRONG.

Gesture controls I like, I find it great, I haven't used this out in the cold and it's now warming up so I can't comment on how this fairs outside messing up like a lot of other users have mentioned. I did try to sort of sleep on my side and it didn't affect gesture control, but you can't sleep on your side with this because it's bulky. The cupping ""hear ambient noise"" works pretty well, although it does take about 2 seconds to kick in.

Noise cancelling is great. It can sometimes cut out people talking, if you have music on, it'll most likely cut it out by 95%. I'm in an office and I can barely hear my own keyboard typing (and I'm a loud typer), I took off the headphones and all of a sudden I was very aware of the ventilation of the office and I've been here for a year and never even noticed it (and I'm very sensitive to noise and details). I can't wait to use these puppers on a plane.

Very comfy, very light, I sort of feel it's a bit big on my head (I have a small head) and I'm on the smallest setting. Wearing glasses, feels superrrrrr comfy, my old Audio Technica's gave me a headache after an hour, especially with glasses. The cups don't fold the ""right way"" that makes sense when you want to put it down, you just have to get used to it. I think they designed it this way so the cups sit on your shoulders when they're around your neck but then it doesn't feel as straight forward to put them down on a desk. I also love the design and find it really sleek compared to others. I don't find it looks ridiculous on my head, and my head as I mentioned is small, like kid size.

The app is cool, though I didn't do much with it and likely won't personally. I did notice you can't play with EQ if you prioritize sound quality (LDAC for example VS SBC).

The quick charge (10 mins for 5 hours) and the 30 hour playback time (though I think a lot of tests said it gave them 22 hours) is super awesome. I can see this being useful in many situations, ex: you forgot to charge them before a plane ride. No problem! 10 mins for 5 hours. The case is also great because everything fits in there nicely (the USB cable, the 3.5mm audio jack, the audio L/R splitter which I haven't seen on any planes anymore because it's 2019 but maybe if you go to a super secluded area where the planes are from like 1990 they might have that. Good luck on that flight, at that point you're likely to hook your headphones up to your ipad anyway and watch a movie because if you have these headphones, you probably have a tablet, or at least a smartphone.

Sound quality for calls. I tried it on a phone call with a friend at home with the laptop running street noise in the background to simulate outdoor environments. I tried it with the 3 diff NC/Ambient settings. I didn't find much difference between the 3. I didn't sound like I was in an underwater cage, it sounded pretty clear, HOWEVER, it sounded like I was across a football as in very very quiet. So this would be shit to use IRL. I see on my phone that I can choose if my bluetooth connected XM3's use the headphones for call audio and I see a toggle. So I think technically I can set that to use the phone's mic, if I were to get a call, that would mean you'd have to take the phone out to speak to and hear the other person on your headphone so it's kind of useless. On a laptop though, Macbook anyway, you can also adjust the output and input (mic). So I had a video call yesterday and the mic was set to the laptop and I was listening in my headphones, worked great. So there is a workaround.

The high latency is noticeable on videos, definitely won't be good for gaming. But it depends how often you'll be using these for videos or how much you care or notice these things, that's on an individual basis. I think if you use the supplied wire instead of bluetooth then you'll remove this issue so let's say you're in a plane using the on-board entertainment unit, you won't have video/audio sync issues but that screen is tiny anyway, low quality, and you have no choice but to use the wire since they don't have bluetooth. So voila.

Adaptive sound control, I played with it only very little. I can't get a straight answer during my search and am waiting for Sony to answer how it works other than ""sense engine"" detects when you're moving. I think it is only through the app so you need to be connected to your phone for example if you're music is coming from that. I believe it works through location on your phone/app. I tested this by walking around my room without the phone in my hand, then walking around the room with my phone, and shaking my phone but not moving. It only worked when I moved around with the phone in my hand. Takes a good 20 seconds to turn on, I don't see myself using this, I would rather shut the ambient sound on/off with the physical button. The Surface headphones does this the best by having one dial for noise cancelling, I would have preferred that to just manually adjust it super easily on the fly.

Ultimately, this being ""perfect"" will depend on your needs. I didn't want to wait for any new headphones since CES 2019 passed and neither giant (Sony or Bose) announced any new ones. I'll see when there is a new release, if Fall 2019 or later, if I keep these or sell and upgrade.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_198?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=198&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The noise cancelling is ok - there are plenty of better alternatives out there - the sound quality is absolute garbage - I played around with the settings for hours trying to get a decent sound balance - the issue being that the noise cancelling is kind of weak so you have to play the volume higher to compensate which then end up with a load of distortion even at 2 or 3 clicks below max.  Treble sounds tinny - bass is ok - not nearly as deep as other NC in ears I've used.
Overall these aren't great - they cost a lot and there are much better alternatives out there in this price range - these feel and sound like what you would expect 60-90$ in ears to sound like.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_40?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=40&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Most flaws still exist, calls much worse. Keep your XM2s!","September 27, 2018","I've had the first version, 1000X, the XM2s, and now the XM3s along with the Bose QC35 and Sennheiser PXC 550. All tests were done with the same settings, volume levels, bluetooth connections, NC settings, etc. Music was evaluated by playing the same songs on both sets of heaphones at the same time to seamlessly go from one to the other for easy comparison.

UPDATE: tried them on a plane and in a loud airport lounge and I'm taking off another star. They're being returned for a refund! Noise cancelling is obviously worse both in a plane and in terms of blocking conversation. The 3s let in an annoying fan like noise on planes that the 2s block. Riding on BART (an extremely loud commuter train) the XM3 are just bad. I had to double check that they were actually on, they let in so much more noise than the 2s. I was concerned I might just have a bad pair, so I took my XM2s into an electronics big box chain and compared the NC to the 3s on display. The ones on display were fully functional. No question, the NC on this pair of XM3s was also clearly worse than the XM2s I've owned for 6 months. It just confirmed I am correct to send back the inferior XM3s. Wait for the 4s if you want to upgrade your X or XM2s.

The 3s just aren't enough of an improvement so far to justify the purchase. On various noise cancelling tests at home (using fans, AC, fridge hum, dryer) they were different, but on some things quite a bit worse. Now that I've flown, they're definitely worse on planes and public transportation. One clear improvement is that the 3s lack the very slight hiss of the 2s, which is only noticeable if no audio is playing, and certainly can't be heard over a plane's noises. Music sounds better at high volume with less distortion than the XM2, but for the most part, the XM2s are more enjoyable to listen to.

The 2s were far better than the 1000X and XM3s on calls. The 3s are unusable for calls. In my quiet home with no background noise, call recipient immediately complained he couldn't hear me well. Put the 550s on and no problem. So Sony really failed here by creating a problem that was previously solved. The other issue is inability to connect to more than one device at a time. I have 6 devices I use regularly. The Senns and Bose are much older models and they can both connect to 2 devices at once and actually function properly.

Even the 1000X were far better at noise cancelling in every test I did vs. the Bose and so are the 3s. Not even close. But the clearly worse system in the 3s is mind boggling. Did no one at Sony actually ever test these?

Out of the box they sounded awful vs. all the others, but after a week of use, they're nearly as good as the 2s, just different. Definitely improved at highest volume, where the 2s have much more distortion.

They're lighter, but feel cheaper, and are slightly more comfortable but still way too hot. I thought the 2s were already very comfortable, just too heavy. If you live in warm weather you're ears will sweat quickly. The much faster charging is great. The ridiculously short charging cable works at least. The annoying, always on, blinking lights are gone fortunately. The power light still blinks, but less than before. The light for NC is gone. No lights would be best. So you get slightly more comfortable (actually a tie for me), slight less weight traded for a very cheap feel.

If sound quality is your main concern, get the 550s. If noise cancelling is, then get the 2s. Can't see any reason to buy the Bose or the XM3. Bose sound the worst of the 5 models I've owned, though they are comfortable. The noise cancelling on the Bose are no longer very impressive, and not much better than the 550s overall and actually let more annoying sound through on a plane.

I bought the alleged ""silver"" model. Hideous! If you have a 84-97 era Mac I guess you'll be happy that you have matching beige headphones. Was hoping they'd be like the silver Bose. They are more beige than in any of the official pics. One of the official pics I've seen is obivous fraud. As for the case, it's fine but BIGGER, wtf?

I'm hoping they blow me away on a plane and train. I've read they cancel voices better so I hope that's the case. UPDATE: NOPE! worse in all regards.

The 2s, which can be found for $200 now are a much better deal than these for $350. When the difference gets down to $50, go for the 3s.

If the 2s had never existed, the XM3 would seem like a great heaphone overall, and it still is. I can't see why anyone would buy these over the 2s now. They also make the Sennheisers the clear winner.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_198?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=198&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The first one was after I'd been wearing them for a few minutes, then took them off to go from my office to another room in the house. I realized that my neighbor had started mowing his lawn while they were on and *I hadn't even noticed*. Absolute silence. The second experience was about half an hour later, when I felt a tap on my shoulder. It was my wife, having failed to get my attention verbally through several attempts. Again, hadn't even noticed. I was playing music by that point, but pretty quietly. My Bose and Plantronics headphones were never *that* effective.

This is similar to the experience I had when I first tried Bose QuietComfort headphones, and they blocked out noise I hadn't even known I was hearing, except that these are as far beyond the Bose as those had been beyond earlier ANC tech. They're *addictively* good. I can't address durability yet (nobody can), but everything else has been good - pairing, battery life and recharge time, comfort, sound quality, etc. The swipe-based controls are responsive and easy to get used to. Quick attention mode is a very nice touch (pun intended) though it's a bit counter-intuitive to cover your ear when you want to hear someone.

These ain't cheap, but if you want the best there's no question these have leapt to the top of the heap.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I live in a full household with lots of background noise and wanted something to block that out. I game with them on. Microphone isn’t supported with gaming systems FYI. Not a big deal.
The audio quality is balanced and very clean.
The app for these headphones has some fun features but generally useless in my opinion.
As I used them I found myself using them for more and more things. I found that I can broadcast to my tv using my iPhone but funnel all my audio through the headset so I can watch tv without disturbing anyone.
I added Dolby Atmos to my game systems and my phone to enhance the audio output and it gives great immersion during gaming sessions.
The headband and ear cups are ultra soft. They form a great seal around my ears but still manage to breathe enough that I don’t sweat.
Battery life is as advertised. Long lasting and easy to recharge. Usb C is a great choice when trying to plug in in the dark.
I had not budgeted for these when I bought them but amazon had a pay as you go option at check out which was very helpful.

I have used noise cancelling earbuds in the past but found they didn't cut the engine roar in the cabin very well and they were uncomfortable in my ears for long periods of time.  I decided to try these headphones after reading the numerous highly complimentary reviews.  I found them to exceed my expectations for airplane noise cancellation and they were very comfortable to wear for the entire length of the long international flights,  The sound quality for listening to music was excellent but they were even comfortable with no music playing when sleeping with only the noise cancellation function operating.  I also used them connected by the USB cable for watching movies, again with fine results.  I especially liked the ease of increasing/decreasing volume and stopping the noise cancellation by either just holding my hand on the right earphone, or by sweeping up or down for volume.  They are very user friendly, comfortable, with long lasting battery, and excellent sound. I am very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend these earphones!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Noise cancelling (NC) kept me in my world of music from liftoff to touchdown with 20 hours of power to spare in each direction. I assume there would have been more power left over if only Ambient Sound (AS) was used, but NC is the only way to go to stay in a cocoon of music. Noticed, however, that one person's medium-pitched voice avoided NC every now and then. Not a problem when there's a cacophony of voices being filtered out. Also, NC dropped to AS a few times. Don't know if it was caused by spurious radio signals during take-off/landing or atmospherics in flight, but again, not a problem. Two clicks of a button and NC was back in control.

In flight and at home, these Sonys allows me to crank it up without bothering anyone and not being bothered with noises that abound. And that volume control? Perfect! No fumbling for buttons. Just a swipe and the volume is where I want it, as well as the playlist tracks.

I dinged one star on sound quality only because I know how Bose sounds. Sony come close enough. Its NC makes it worth the trade-off!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The design is awesome, and the wearing comfort is exceptional -- these headsets are awesome for wearing them over a long period of time -- the cushions go nicely around the earlobes, and do not touch/squeeze them.

The 30 hour battery is amazing!

At max volume the ound is a little bit louder compared with it's competitors, and I rate that as a definite plus.

So why only 3 stars?

Compared to it's competition, the SONY headset does not support Bluetooth multi-point connections (DUAL A2DP).
This means that you CAN NOT connect your phone and a computer at the same time, and it will NOT switch the audio seamlessly between audio-sources.

So if you want to be connected to two devices, this might not be a good choice for you

Another problem is that when you have audio playing on the device (e.g. phone), and then switch on the SONY headset, the audio does not automatically get switched to the headset after it bluetooth connects :(

These were an impulse buy that I regretted immediately, assuming the difference would be pretty small. Then I put these things on and holy forking shirtballs, the silence was shocking. Yup, these are worth 300 bucks more than the cheaper ones. I say $70 for the Cowin headphones and $300 or $350 for the Sony ones are what they are really worth, both fair prices.

Edit: The padding design is weird, it dips down in the center so only a small area makes contact with the top of the head and it causes a dull ache. I fixed this with the super weird knitted headphone cozy in the picture, bought here on Amazon. Now I am comfortable and stylish.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_38?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=38&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was already happy with my previous pair, and was not a huge fan of the mx2's. But every professional review of the mark 3s was close to perfect so i decided to buy a pair.

Things i noticed right away is how much more comfortable they were than the xm2's. The design has improved a lot and they look less awkward due to the closer (?) Fit to the head. I wore them for 4 hours straight earlier and they never bothered me, they seem to be much lighter this time around.

The noise cancellation also blows bose out of the water. It is honestly amaIng how much sound these cancel out, felt like i was alone when surrounded by a ton of people at my campus today. These have the best noise cancelling feature i have ever used on a pair of headphones for sure. Also, it has a 30 hour battery life while using the ANC feature which is awesome. But with the added usb-c charging you dont even need to worry about that because just 10 mins of charging gives you 5 hoursmin of battery!

I dont know much about sound and what makes it good, but i prefer the sound of these compared to bose, it feels more full and lively.

Lastly, the touch controls are honestly great and really easy to use. Dont need to pull ouy my phone to change basic settings which is pretty convinient.

So if you are looking for headphones that have great noise cancelling, high comfort, and a good sound. I would recommend the Sony 1000xm3 over the Bose qc35ii","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_95?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=95&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I had the old Plantronics Backbeat Pro 1 and after 3.5 years I decided to upgrade myself with the prime day price and am pleasantly surprised. I wish the headphone functionality was a little more intuitive, I wish they could connect to two Bluetooth devices at once and I wish the battery lasted longer with ANC on, the Plantronics seemed to last for days, but the audio quality and ANC make up for those deficiencies. I recommend at the $300 mark but I'd probably be a little disappointed if I paid more than that. Overall a solid value if you take solace in the silence.

El rendimiento de la batería muy bien. No estoy seguro si dura las 30 horas que promete, pero pude hacer el vuelo de ida sin necesidad de cargar la batería. El único PERO que tengo es el control de volumen. Al ser táctil, es muy fácil que un roce cambie el volumen. Otro problema que tuve era al dar pausa y ponerme los audífonos en el cuello, el roce con mi ropa ponía play nuevamente sin darme cuenta. Valorarlo que otros audífonos con los controles de botones no darían el problema. Si no tienes problemas con este detalle son unos audífonos perfectos.

Three things matter to me most when trying out headphones:
1) Sound - Rich and crisp sound across all genres. From rap to electronic to country, the WH1000XM3 appear to handle pushing both bass and treble. You can also fine tune the equalizer through a variety of presets or customize your own settings via the mobile app.
2) Comfort - BY FAR the most comfortable headphones I've ever used. Even a few hours into my flight, I could barely even tell they were on my head. I love listening to music as I try to fall asleep on long flights and the padding around the ears is so soft and comfortable it makes dozing off a breeze. They're also very compact and light compared to other competitor's noice cancelling headphones I've tried.
3) Noise cancellation - Whatever technology they've developed seems to be hands down the best on the market for noise cancellation. I thought the noise cancellation on my Sennheiser PXC 550 headphones were good but this is a whole next level. On top of that, you can control the degree of noise cancellation and also dictate directionally where the noise is coming from inside the mobile app for added performance.

Overall, the Sony WH1000XM3 headphones will be my new go to choice for my travels. The case design is sleek, the product performs amazingly, and the battery has lasted over multiple days of extended travel. Thanks Sony for making music a little bit more enjoyable for me!

Now that I have them they are a total nightmare to pair with my apple IOS devices.

If you've got them paired to your phone you have to go into settings, disconnect, and then connect to your next device. If you don't nothing will work.

Worse, I spend more time trying to pair and re-pair with my computer. Almost never works.

No amount of noise cancelling could make up for this terrible user experience.

Contacted SONY ad their advice was to pair with only one device. So a four hundred dollar pair of headphones that only works with one device... What's the point?

If I were you I'd stick with the Bose QC-35 - they perform better.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After seeing all the hype about the M3's I figured I would give them a go.

These headphones are great. The app is useful and easy to use and the sound is excellent. Noise cancellation is effective and practical.

The only thing I find myself missing from the QC35's is dual pairing. It's just a little annoying to have to go back and forth between my phone and tablet, but it's not a deal breaker.

Overall, these have taken the #1 spot in my bag for headphones on a daily basis and I would recommend them to anyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_49?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=49&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Sonys have the edge in regard to sound quality. If you’re into diverse frequency music with a blend of bass and treble I can guarantee you they have the best sound on the market. I was impressed...going from a heavy pair of $400 VModas to this lightweight, almost cheap feeling pair, Sony absolutely stood out as more satisfying.

That aside, noise isolation is decent. Sony’s proprietary system crushes ambient sound and you’ll begin to wander how you ever lived with that horrific white noise in your life. But voices are still audible, they really only cancel out the humming and not all frequencies. Still one of the best on the market and a must-have, but the technology is obviously still in development.

The call quality is poor. I actually can’t use them for phone calls because I feel bad for the people on the other end. They sound like you’re using the speaker of your Nokia back in 2006, muddy and distant. Your friends will tell you it’s fine and it doesn’t bother them, but your real friends will tell you to turn them off immediately bc they would rather talk to themselves than deal with that. If you’re trying to weed out fake friends this may not be an issue.

In conclusion, if you need over ears for a desk job where you feel a little less like yourself every day these are your best options at this time. The over-ear market, however, is not impressive. If you care significantly about audio quality and don’t listen to music with noticeable levels of bass, go with Bose.

Don’t buy Beats over-ears or the new Powerbeats Pros. Do buy the Powerbeats 3 Wireless, they are the best in-ears on the market.

Don’t buy Bose in-ears. Don’t buy anything Harmon Kardon, Sennheiser, or VModa.

Quite possibly.","December 10, 2018","I have the dubious pleasure of being a software engineer who works in an open office - possibly one of the world's loudest. Imagine a room 30ft/20ft with 30 people in it, most of whom are on conference calls at their desks for most of the day. Now, make the room entirely out of hardwoods and glass, with hard, low ceilings, so sound echoes and is amplified. If, like me, you have focus issues, maintaining productivity can be a challenge.
For the past 4 months I've been making do with my Bose QC over-ear headphones. They were... OK, I guess, but terrible at cutting out voice, so any quiet bits of music, or gaps between tracks, and the conversations come blasting through. And I've never been particularly happy with the audio quality on these headphones. They ""did the job"", if barely.
But not any more. These Sony headphones are nothing short of miraculous. I can truly tune out my environment, without turning music up to hearing-damaging levels. On top of that, the sound quality (even with Bluetooth) is exceptional - better than the Bose by light-years. A rock-solid 5 stars on these puppies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_26?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=26&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Absolutely stunning. They sound great too, and are very comfortable. Not to mention the tech features... clearly best in class.

first issue - After a few days, the headphones would make the windy static noise in the right ear after being on for about an hour. This sound would flip to my left ear when turning XM3s around. It bothered me as you can literally feel the wind in your eardrum and it is uncomfortable, like its a bad artifact in the white noise. Weird...

second issue - The LDAC will stutter when set to LDAC output and High Quality 990Kb on Samsung S10. I am not sure if it's the phone's output, or the headphones DAC, or whatever...you must put it to 660Kb to work well.

Noise canceling is better at all frequencies from the deep rumble of an engine to the high shreak of a baby crying.

The Sony has crisp clean highs and a clean mid. Combined with an extended but not boomy bass, it made listening enjoyable without listening fatigue.

Used it many times since, without complaints.
 I have big ears and headphones were always uncomfortable for me but this one actually goes over ear and I could wear it literally for 10 hours straight, no discomfort. And it looks so nice too (I bought the silver one).
It is cancelling noise pretty well, and not only airplanes: my husband plays guitar pretty loud and this baby blocked it all - not by itself but while listening to music, however that’s still better than any other headphone I’ve ever tried.
The sound quality still amazes me and the options to choose from are so cool, I like the live stage one most. I had no idea the music I was listening to in my car had so many layers until I heard it on these.
So, it’s pricey, yes.

I can’t hear the loud screeching sound by my air conditioner anymore with this headphone. The outside noise cancels by 70% without any music and with music you will be in a different world.

There is adaptive sound control which is helpful to cater noise cancellation based on your surrounding. You could position from where the the sound flows to your ears.

The headphones fit so apt over your ears and I wore it 6 hours straight without our any discomfort.

I will start off by saying the sound on these is incredible and easily better than the Bose. There is absolutely no contest in that area. These are a 10/10 while the Bose are approximately 7.5/10. The sound on the Bose isn't bad but for the price, they offer a far less impressive sound profile than the Sonys. Everything sounds great on the Sony while the Bose couldn't handle certain genres as well (bass heavy electronic music for example).

Now that that's out of the way, the reason why I will be returning these and keeping the Bose is because of the comfort level. As a software engineer, I needed a pair of headphones that I could COMFORTABLY wear all day and the Sonys simply do not live up to that task. After approximately 90 minutes, I start to feel a light pain on the top of my head from the clamping of the headphones and my ears start to feel warm which is extremely uncomfortable. I am then forced to remove them to reduce the fatigue before I can put them back on.

The Bose on the other hand I can wear seemingly endlessly without any discomfort.

I wish there was a pair I could buy that were a 10/10 in both sound AND comfort but for now, the Bose win.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I mainly got these headphones because I heard the ANC and sound were amazing and they certainly are. As the phone quality, I must admit to a moment of stupidity on my own part. My first few calls with the m3s was what I was sort of expecting, due to multiple reports, bad. Then I find out I had the headphones on backwards, the right on my left ear and the left on my right ear. My call after correcting this? The person on the other end could hear me loud and clear. I do hear an echo of my voice, like I'm using a mic, but I can deal with it.

Heisenmenn","Completely different sound, WOW","January 31, 2019","These are awesome. Picked them over the HD1 and so far I'm glad I did. The noise cancelling is amazing, I can't even hear my mechanical keyboard (its loud) typing this and barley hear myself swallow. This is my first pair of high quality headphones (coming from a pair of 30$ Sennheisers) and I'm blown away. If you want to hear music like it was meant to be heard, grab yourself a pair of these. I listen to basically every type of music, from country, rock, rap and EDM; everything sounds good through these cans. I can't get over the noise cancelling, I could probably use these on a gun range and it would muffle pistol shots.

They are incredibly comfy. Had them on for 2 hours so far this morning and I barley notice they are there. I have TMJ (jaw problems) and these don't bother my face at all.

Bluetooth pairing to my phone is the fastest I've ever seen it connect to something. I turn them on and as soon as I do I get the connected to Bluetooth message, which is awesome. No fiddling with settings or anything, it just works fast. Bluetooth on my laptop doesn't sound as good as on the android, likely due to Sonys LDAC support in newer android versions.

Comes with a cord to attach to a regular 3.5mm jack, used it on my PC to play some FLAC files I have and they sound even better than the LDAC Bluetooth, which itself is amazing.

As far as the warranty goes, make sure you buy the extra one, but NOT FROM AMAZON! The one on the amazon page only covers the speakers, not if your headphones snaps, which seems to be a problem with some Sony headphones. I actually got in contact with Amazon support and they got me in touch with Square Trade warranty. 3 years for $75.99 and it covers the headphones as long as they aren't lost/stolen. I already spent 300 on the headphones, so whats another 70-80 bucks to make sure they last at least a few years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Storfer","The stuff the other reviews don't tell you","November 26, 2018","Just received these today...tested for a few hours on a range of music- from classical to jazz to hip hop, pop and classic rock. I am a bit of a headphone junkie and have had several pairs of Sennheisers (HD1, PXC550), Bose QC 25, QC 35, Parrot Zik 2 and 3, VModa Crossfade, Crossfade 2 wireless, Zn etc. Most of the positive reviews of these headphones are completely on point. Phenomenal noise cancellation. Great sound detail (I could hear people taking their foot off the piano pedals during Jazz songs such as Frank Morgan's Lullaby or the snare drum rattling from Barry Oakley's bass in Allman Brothers live at Fillmore east or Adele taking breaths between long notes) - HOWEVER, these headphones are so bass rich that it overwhelms the rest of the sound frequencies. If you're a bass-head, these are definitely for you. But, if you like a neutral soundstage, you will probably find this annoying. The good news is that on the app at least, there is a ""clearbass"" setting on the EQ that can be dialed down. However, they still overemphasize bass and I haven't figured out how to dial it down when connected to my laptop. Two other annoying things - while largely comfortable, I found the headband dug into the top of my head a bit and my ears got hot after an hour of listening. Second annoying thing - these things are HUGE when on (and I believe I have a normal size head). They look kind of dorky. If you want to look cool in your headphones, these are also probably not for you. However, if you're my age and care less about coolness than sound quality and noise cancellation, it matters much less (but still matters a bit). Anyway, just thought I'd share these thoughts with you. Thus the 4 star rating instead of 5.

Although sony has replaced the product with one phone call and showing proof. Unfortunately I noticed the damage 1 day after Amazon's return policy, so I'm stuck with them. If it was within the return window I would have returned them and purchased a a different brand. Now I just have to treat them as if they were made of glass.
Main reason for choosing these over a different brand was because the charging port is USB-C which makes it easier  when traveling instead of bringing multiple wires with you. Another downfall is that they can only be paired to 1 device at a time. So if u want to use them on a different device it has to be unpaired and repaired.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_48?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=48&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I am sure they would be fine for a light jog or biking, but when it comes to weight lifting, HITT, or basketball, these definitely slip off. Some people say you can buy ear covers to help mitigate this issue, but I  was not able to find any success.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_35?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=35&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Low standards.  Not comfortable for long sessions, Mud/weak bass response..  Weak presence.  Noise Cancellation is not what I expected . App will not run from a laptop,  Controls do not function when connect via audio cable.  Phone app install process is obscene (make you install a 3rd party app first, then Google play  - then Headphone Connect - all of which is totally not necessary in today's world  - this should be a stand alone app with a single install- but no!  Can't even tell if/when it will work/be usable.  All of which could be overlooked BUT for the relatively poor fidelity.  Not pleased given the price.  Too many gimmicks (that sort-of-maybe work) and not enough attention given to sound quality. Down-graded to 2 stars because the bluetooth connection drops out way too often even at 2-3 ft away. VERY not impressed.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Touch controls are horrible","January 16, 2019","First, I love the battery life and the type c charging. The sound is good. The mic, not so much it has some static.
The build quality feels cheap, lots of plastic. I prefer the QC35 II in this department.
I knew it only could pair to one device at a time, but didn't realize how annoying that would be.
My main gripe with these though, and are a deal breaker is the buttons and touch control.
First, the two buttons on the left cup are very small and thin. Hard to find straight away as they aren't very tactile. One uses either Google Assistant or ambient level changer. The other button is the power button. Bose does this a lot better in my opinion.

Finally, the touch controls on the right cup are just garbage. It takes multiple taps to pause or play. The sliding gestures are a bit more reliable like volume and next track. The most reliable is the palm over ear to lower volume and allow ambient sound.

All Bose has to do is improve noise cancelling, sound a bit and add type c on their next iteration and I'll give them my dollars.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Also, after using them for a couple of months, I'm having issues with the audio sticking and skipping- usually this is resolved by rebooting the headphones, but it's not something I would expect in such a highly priced branded item.

Have been a Bose fan for years (still am) but just couldnt pass up the sound these produce. If you're looking for a more mellow flat sound go with the QC35's. These have a bit of bass but easy enough to get them close to the mellow flat sound of a Bose (again all about taste and what you're looking for here). If youre looking for a more home theater alternative these are your headphones. Bought them to block out some noisy neighbors when I'm watching movies or playing games and given that I can no longer hear my footsteps or 3D printer on top of the neighbors I'd say they over delivered in the best way.

If you care about MUSIC, buy an earlier model (e.g. XM2). Had to return them.","December 2, 2018","A first for me. I have these Sony headphones: MDR-1000X, WH-1000XM2,WI-1000X, BC-WF1000X, as well as a couple of their WIRED ANC phones. This one SOUNDS the worst - by far!

(I suspect they had been returned to ""Amazon Warehouse"" for that very reason. ""Inspected"" sticker means they work, but haven't been evaluated for quality)

Here's what I can't live with. The overall sound quality. They sound bad. Legitimately bad. I honestly do not know what all the reviewers are talking about. The increased bass response is completely unnatural. Good bass does not make itself known, it's just a natural extension of the sound. Instead, it's readily apparent that the bass is cranked up. I can mostly live with that unless it takes away from the rest of the presentation. Going back and forth for a full day with the XM2's, I can definitively say my XM3 unit sounded muddy, muddled, and lacking crispness. The difference was astounding. I keep the response curve flat and leave on the default settings including the high quality stream. I'm using Google Music on a Pixel 2XL as my source. The highs lose their definition and edge. Things that should be clear, crisp, sound like they are coming through fabric or drywall or something. Going back to the XM2, they were far tighter and clear. The XM3 does soften the hard edges of older recordings. My albums by The Monkees sound better with the high treble softened, but on modern music, it's frustrating to try to hear the edge of sounds that now just blend like mush into the mid bass.

I had a co-worker do a blind test. After 20 seconds with the XM3's, he declared they sound terrible. He confirmed what I had been feeling and told me to keep the XM2's.

Maybe I had a bad unit. When I tested the floor model of the XM2's a few months ago it sounded like garbage but the reviews were so good I took a chance. My home unit sound way way way better. So with the stellar reviews of the XM3's I figured it was a safe buy. I am incredibly disappointed. I really really really really really wanted to like these. I really did. But reading gleeful claims that they have a ""laid back"" sound while comparing to the more ""lively"" B&W PX headphones is a joke. If ""laid back"" means lacks definition and accurate energy... then okay, they are super laid back. I want it to sound right. I want guitars to have that edge. Vocals to sound present, not behind a veil. Bass to have quick response, not lingering mud. These sound like they have a standing wave in the midbass.

As a side note: I've never gotten the NFC pairing to work on with the XM2 or XM3.

It seems I'm in the minority. But reading other reviews I see people talking about how similar the sound quality is between the XM2 and XM3. Not for me. Vastly different. I'll miss the greater sound stage, but I'll easily pick a more accurate sound than the mud.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Flanagan","Music sounds great, horrible call quality","January 24, 2019","I've owned a number of wired headphones, from Bose and Sennheiser to previous Sony models. I have the Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II, which is the most direct comparison to this unit. The music on the Bose headset sounds very good, but lacks brightness, and there are no EQ modifications that you can make. On the Sony, the music sounds better, and you do have the equalization. Sony also has soundfield adaptation, so that the noise canceling is adjusted depending on where you are and what you are doing – sitting quietly, in a crowded public space, on a train. But to me, those simply add unnecessary complexity. And on a phone call, they are quality killers.

Immediately after I purchased these and started using them, I would get complaints from people when I was talking to them on the phone. At first, I brushed these off (I'm hiking in the woods, how good do you expect it to be?). But then, it was happening in my house, all alone. I tested it by calling myself and leaving messages, rather long ones, using both the Sony and the Bose. The call quality difference was startling. The Bose was clear, the Sony was muddled.

I waited until there was a firmware update, as I thought perhaps Sony engineers would be able to fix it. Alas, the update came, and all it does is add support for Alexa.

The other area of criticism I have is the touch controls. They work, but only intermittently. I probably look like a moron, wiping my finger on the right headphone back, forth, up, down. I've taken to using the phone to skip songs and adjust volume.

At $250 this would be a great set of headphones for just listening to music, and ignoring call quality and problems with controls. At $350, it's overpriced.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

1. You cannot charge them and use them at the same time.
2. You cannot listen to them over USB-C.
3. You can use them wired, but the included cable doesn't have a wire for the mic. So you cannot use them wired, for example, for a phone call.
4. When using them wired, you cannot use any of the controls for play/pause or skip. This is technically possible, but was not implemented.
5. Configuring from the mobile app doesn't always stick. Sometimes you have to configure the same setting a second time the next time you use the headphones.
6. When changing between noise canceling, ambient, and no ambient control, there is a voice that announces what the setting it, and there is no option to turn this off.
7. Only includes a USB type-A (the old, rectangular style) to USB-C cable for charging. (No USB-C to USB-C cable included.)
8. The included charging cable is about 6 inches long.

I fly a lot for work and have tried about all versions of HK,  Bose, JBL, AKG and Audio Acoustica. On ear, In Ear, active, passive cancellation. You name it. I have drawers full of headphones.
These Sony headphones beat all of them. The ANC is the best I have experienced, its almost too good and reminds me of stepping into the anechoic chamber at JBL which is a completely silent room with no echo.  The audio quality is extremely precise with a huge sound stage, but as others pointed out a bit bass heavy. Easy to correct with the very well designed app.
I picked the grey/silver edition being bald / blond they don't look so out of place ;-)  They fit well on my large head and have just the right amount of pressure to be snug but comfortable.
Lightweight and 30 hours of play time! They feel so well build, the cushions and headband are soft and supple.
As I type this I can not hear my typing noise, I can not hear closing a door. Its just about every external noise is erased from my world. Other headphones struggle with higher frequencies and voices. These bring you silence and bliss.

Major disappointment.

Honestly the sound is muddy and the bass is unnatural. The poor excuse for an app is a total joke. I’ve no idea why they think we want some of the features, just give us the best possible sound quality, who cares about crap like sound stage positioning and fake reverb, etc.

I have the Bose qc35s for noise cancelling and travel cans, and have never loved them. However, compared to this they actually shine. They suffer from the Bose Sound but I’ve gotten used to them for travelling.

First thing I did when I got them was update the firmware. 40 minutes (!) later I was able to listen to music on these and eventually settled on EQ settings that are “acceptable” (-1,+1,+2,+3 and “clear bass” -2).

My references are Audeze and Etymotic Research and while I don’t expect that kind of quality, I would expect much more than this.

These are probably going back.

You can't be serious.","April 5, 2019","Honestly, I didn't need to get these headphones, as I've been a satisfied owner of the Bose QC35II for a while now. But I'd heard so many glowing reviews about the Sony (""NC function blows Bose out of the water,"" ""Sony is the state of the art,"" etc.), that I thought I had to get it. I figured I'd give the Bose to my spouse who's been wanting a pair of NC headphones. I ended up giving up the Sonys.

First, and this is a really really key point for me, the Sonys are UNCOMFORTABLE compared with the Bose. The Bose earpads are deeper and the driver surface is more recessed than the Sony earpads. The result is that unless you have petite ears you feel the driver surface on your ears. My ears got sweaty after a short while.

Soundwise? Not bad... but not really better than the Bose. And the swipe volume control really really necessary?? Give me an up-down click function anytime.

Bottom line: I'm writing this so that any Bose owners out there who are thinking they should upgrade to the Sonys because of all the (exagerrated) hoopla... DON'T.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

All I can say is WOW these are AMAZING.  I am not an audiophile and going to compare this to others or go into what if and what is and all that.  From a normal persons perspective, just WOW amazing sound quality.

The noise reduction is simply unbelievable.  I turned on a double window fan, a 16"" fan on a stand and a big floor size air purifier all in the same room and with these on could not hear anything.  Take them off and it is like I am in a wind tunnel and can't even hear the normal TV.

The sound quality can be adjusted with their app and after I adjusted it to how ""I"" like my sound, you just stand there in AWE as it is so quality.

Walking the streets and riding the subway day in and day out becomes an altogether different experience when you can escape into your own world of music, audiobooks, or even just the relative silence offered by ANC headphones. Before purchasing the 1000XM3s, I had some junky wireless earbuds that, at the time, I thought sounded pretty good. I was WRONG! Compared to the 1000XM3s, I might as well have had a pair of tin cans strapped to my head.

If you are reading this review and are seriously considering these headphones, then you have likely read other reviews and already know they are in the top of their class in terms of sound quality. I had planned to use them primarily during my commutes but have since found myself wearing them throughout the day. I have rediscovered my music collection, am hearing things I’ve never heard before, blah blah blah…all those wonderful things people say after switching to some expensive speakers/headphones. But it’s true, they sound GOOD! As you’ve probably also already heard, they do not have a perfectly flat response. They are a slightly bass-heavy, which is fine, even preferably for most of what I listen too.

If the bottom-heavy response is holding you back, the Sony Headphones app offers adjustable EQ with factory and customizable user presets. Additionally, you can select multiple “surround” settings as well as sound position controls, neither of which are very useful in my opinion. More important to me was the LDAC and Aptx-HD codec support. I’ll admit, it took me a couple days to figure out how to get these things to run LDAC with my Samsung Note 8, however, once I got it working, I absolutely noticed improved quality over the default SBC codec. Unfortunately, using LDAC requires operating in “priority on sound quality” mode which disables the surround, position, and equalizer functions. Fortunately for me, I am not particularly interested in these options anyway. At least these things support high quality codecs in the first place, unlike Bose.

You know what else Bose headphones don’t have? USB type-C! While this was initially not a major selling point for me, after using them every day, I am grateful for the faster charging of the type-C format. A ten-minute charge (or less) almost always gets me back to 100%. Not that I really need it. These headphones last FOREVER. The longest I have continuously used them was about 8 hours (with ANC on). Afterwards, I tapped the power button and the sexy Sony woman voice said, “about 70% battery remaining”. Extrapolating from that, the advertised 30-hour battery life seems accurate.

Noise-cancelling is great! I don’t know what else to say. It’s not 100%. Obnoxiously loud people will still be faintly audible, but otherwise, pretty much all of the outside world is effectively cancelled out. I have not tried Bose ANC headphones or previous Sony models, but basically all reviewers say that the 1000-XM3s are the best on the market and I have no reason to believe otherwise. Also note, the Headphones app allows for customizable levels of noise-cancelling. There is an adaptive noise-cancelling feature which will adjust this setting after automatically detecting whether your are sitting, walking, running, or in transit. I have chosen to disable this as I prefer full noise cancelling 100% of the time. But I do see the value in this feature. Hopefully I won’t unknowingly walk out in front of a bus.

I basically love everything about these headphones. Even the hard case feels luxurious and is literally as compact and thin as they could have possibly made it – an important feature for those of us who carry bags around all day with limited space! My only complaint is that they do not support multiple simultaneous Bluetooth connections, that is, I cannot connect my laptop and phone at the same time - a minor issue considering it takes only 10 seconds to manually switch between devices.

Anyway, I hope this review will be helpful to those on the fence. I spent days researching these damn things before pulling the trigger. They aren’t cheap for good reason; some serious top-notch engineering went into these headphones. You will not be disappointed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Worth the investment for my daily commute and even during work hours.

Also I got tinnitus recently, I heard the in the ear headphone can cause it, that's why I want to switch to the over the ear headphone.

Lots of reviews praised the Sony WH1000XM3, but there are lots of criticisms about the call quality, the first thing I did when I got this device was to test the call quality, I am happy to report that it performs very well with Samsung S8+ cell phone.  I tried to call out and received calls in the quite room or a room full of noises, the other end(wife) said she can hear my voice clearly, although sounded a little far compare to the the cell phone, when I connect the headphone with the cell phone with the supplied audio cable, my wife the quality is the same as the talking to the cell phone directly.  The same tests were performed after I updated with the latest firmware, and still good.

The noise cancellation and control etc. are excellent, the only thing I am not satisfied is there is no blue tooth connection priority list configuration.  Yes you are pair this headphone with multiple blue tooth sources, but it only reconnects to the last connection, ideally if the app on phone can provide a configuration page to specify the connection priority is first computer then phone, and when I walk in the office and turn on the laptop, it should switch the connection from my phone to my laptop, and when I turn off my laptop it should switch back to the phone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews"

About the same cost as the newest BOSE model, only better! Noise canceling feature is excellent; sound quality is excellent (don't even need the app to adjust the factory set sound settings, unless you are an absolute sound freak)!  Love the touch control features, and comfort of these headphones. The kit even came with the charge cord, the single jack cord and the adapter for the double one, for those times you may need it!  Bluetooth works perfectly!  The only issue is that it is not bluethooth compatible with my iPad (not a big deal for me).  Works well with all other Apple devices that I own.

I decided to pay full price and test it out.  Music is spot on, it is as good as everyone said.  Before bringing it to work, I decided to test the mic at home with both no ambient noise and loud TV.  I tried calling myself with both the iPhone and Google Voice on PC paired to the headphones.  When the room is quiet, the mic actually worked decent.  My fiancee said I sounded like I was in a tunnel, but she could make out what I was saying.  So it appears the most serious mic issues had been resolved.  I cranked the TV up loud, and with NC on, my voice could be heard but the background noise was overpowering.  I tried using the mic on my iPhone and it worked better than the headphones with loud ambient noise.

I brought the headphones to work as I needed to drown out some cubicle farm noise.  When room and people were quiet, my remote coworkers did not have any issues hearing me on conference calls.  They did mention that it sounded like I was in a bathroom.  No complaints, it was definitely good.  The next day, my boss tried calling me with a lot of co-workers talking loudly around me.  He said it sounded like I was in a movie theatre and said the people around me were louder than my voice.  He told me to immediately switch to another headset.  I called back using my iPhone and everything was fine.  This confirms the ambient noise problem on other reviews I seen.  Appears to be a hardware limitation and placement of the NC/mics.

So yes, the music is good.  But at this price point, I felt it was not worth it.  The noise canceling feature on much cheaper headphones work almost as well.  I do not believe the excuse that the mic should not be important on these (since they should be used mostly for music) as they are asking top dollar.  Any feature placed by the manufacturer should work flawlessly.  Otherwise, remove it.  The Bose can do it, so I am confident the next version will address this.  Until then, back to my $20 Logitech headset.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Fritz","Comfortable Headphones with Excellent Audio, Impressive Build Quality and Amazing Noise Cancellation","September 19, 2018","I have a soundproofed studio, therefore I generally don’t have much need for a noise cancelling headset. In fact, you won’t find a single one in my studio. However, I do have times when I want to audition tracks outside of the studio–sometimes while my wife watches TV, listens to ABBA on her Echo, or talks over her iPhone. Sony has a decent reputation for studio headphones. The Sony MDR-7506s that are in use in my studio are nothing short of legendary. Therefore, I decided to give the Sony WH1000XM3 Noise Canceling Over Ear Headphones a try.

The headphones come in a nice zippered case and include a USB Type-C charging cable, an auxiliary audio cable (in case you want to listen Bluetoothless) and a set of printed instructions. The case itself even has a diagram showing how to store the headphones. That’s a nice touch.

There is no charger included and I found the included USB charging cable to be way too short. It’s maybe three inches long max making it difficult to place the headset in a stable position while it is being charged. I would have preferred a longer charger cable and also a longer audio cable as well, perhaps a coiled one. After all, everything else about this headphone is premium, so why not the cables? In fact, the headset shouts “quality” even when it first comes out of its carton.

As stated previously, the Sony WH1000XM3 Headphones can be used wirelessly over Bluetooth or with a wired connection. Also as stated previously, I’ve never owned a pair of noise cancelling headsets. I have to say that the noise canceling in this headset is amazing–almost startling. When I switched the noise cancelling on while sitting about five feet from the TV audio system, the TV became dead quiet. I could see the actor’s lips moving, but I couldn’t hear a word that they were saying. That’s pretty amazing!

Noise cancelling ability aside, I was interested in evaluating the audio quality of the Sony WH1000XM3 Headphones. Could they stand up to the Sennheiser HD 598 and Sony MDR-7506 headsets that already occupy space in my studio? Actually, I started listening not in the studio, but on my iPad Air via a Bluetooth connection to compressed MP3 music. I found the quality to be more than acceptable. Quite good as a matter of fact. Then I continued my listening with a wired connection to a my studio audio system. I auditioned a variety of high quality, uncompressed audio files. This included jazz, rock, folk and classical tracks.

My main test piece was the classic “Take Five” by the Dave Brubeck quartet. This track really tests an audio system during Joe Morello’s drum solo. On a “good” system Morello’s drum has a sharp cracking sound. It’s a very difficult sound for many headphones and audio systems to reproduce and they wind up instead making the crack a dull thud. And, yes, with the the Sony WH1000XM3 Headphones Morello’s drum sounded sharp and clean. I heard the cracking sound. Paul Desmond’s alto sax sounded almost as if it was in the room.

All-in-all not a bad showing for Sony. The overall sound quality was very good. These headphones have a wide sound field with a clean open sound. To my ears, the bass sounded a touch heavy although certainly not boomy or forced. This was easily corrected by using the studio equalizer to pull back the lows slightly and push the highs up also slightly. I did nothing to the midrange. The sound that I heard was more than acceptable. I experienced no ear fatigue even after several hours of listening.

These are extremely comfortable headphones to wear. They are closed-back, so the ears do get a bit warm, however. The headband is nicely padded and easy on the head as are the earphones themselves. Given this comfort, plus it’s excellent audio quality, impressive build quality and amazing noise cancelling ability, the Sony WH1000XM3 Noise Canceling Over Ear Headphones have earned themselves a permanent place in my studio.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_195?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=195&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Never More Disappointed in a Purchase","May 21, 2019","Don't know if I have written a review before, but this purchase was a disaster.  I read every review I could find; CNET, Amazon Reviews, Videos and was really excited by what Sony came out with; the cover the Right ear to hear Flight Attendant, the noise canceling, comfortable cups etc.
I had Bose for years --but they are wired-- and the wire in this WeWork and Coffee Shop World is major pain.
I got the night before 14 hour international travel, took out on the night before to set up, charge and take with me; first, the Noise Cancelation is now where near the quality of Bose.  I was in first class and could hear voices from what I thought was the row behind me, I turned to shoot them a look and it was first row in Coach.  Now I may sound like a Diva :) but there is a serious issue that you have to turn the volume up to block out noise-- that is what is wonderful about the Bose they block out plane engines so you can save your ears a bit.
The features; what I thought was great, was just overcomplicated.  You have to use the app and if I heard ""optimizing"" once more, I was going to throw them into the ocean.  I just want to put on a set of headphones and enjoy, chaning for altitude, adjusting, etc etc. just too much.
Punch line?  I took them on this trip, came back to US, got a coffee at Starbucks and someone stole them!  ha!
I think the person may return them to Starbucks, not because they are kind hearted, but because they are such a disappointment.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

As someone who takes Audio quailty very seriously  I was shocked about how good these  bluetooth headphones are. I never knew bluetooth audio was this good.

The noise canceling on these  is out of this world. The material quailty is top notch and I didn't  notice any pitching from  the  headband.

I would say that Sony has better sound quality but it's also boomy. I have to use headphone to listen to music everyday and even use it for mixing. So far I would say that it's very bassy. Good thing that Sony let you adjust the EQ, that helps but still that's kind of annoying to have to adjust the overall sound.

Noise cancelling is very well done. My ears got a bit numb after a few hours though. The pressure is pretty strong even though I adjusted to fit myself. Sometime after using it for a while I feel very weird and feel like I can't hear well. Not sure why.

I also agreed with many people that the pad around the ears could have with deeper. It hurt my ears after a few hours.

Overall I think it's one of the best headphone out there. Those are just a few things they could improve in the future!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_35?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=35&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Once I located them here on Amazon, it took me a month to find out how bad I wanted them. And honestly, it’s the full package. I would say it needs more bass or an increase in decibels, but anymore of that would probably harm you. It works for me and I’m a bass head. I would say if your on the fence line, you could check them out like I did at your nearest Best Buy. Unfortunately, for me trying them on there didn’t justify there potential until I had them in my claws. The Sony WH1000XM3 give so many options within the app. And, if you don’t get the headset application then your really missing out on these baby’s. All in all, I give them a 9/10.

Not quite in the league of more expensive wired phones, but considering the price differential, an excellent sounding product.  Noise cancellation is also top notch. Adding Alexa to the phones requires use of the button normally used to vary noise control, but you can control noise cancellation variation easily in the app. I use them when cutting grass with a tractor and it greatly diminishes the engine noise.  Phone calls received are good, although I haven’t needed this feature much, to date. Fit is comfortable.  I often use them in wired mode, with the power on, and find them better than my older wired phones (which aren’t the expensive pro type).  One thing to note: the ads say “now with Alexa”, but you still have to download and set up Alexa. Not a big deal, I guess.  The volume control takes getting use to, since it requires you to move a finger up or down on the right cup but it work ok.  Sound quality was my primary goal and the XM3 doesn’t disappoint. Overall, very happy with the whole package.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Using them for calls isn’t great and the Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II really beats Sony in this category.  Not sure if it’s the position of the microphone but calls are not great with the Sonys. I still use the Bose for calls and Skype. But for watching a movie or listening to music, Sony can’t be beat.

Very comfortable to wear. I don't have problems with wearing it for a few hours. Although it is heavier than QC 35, it's hard to notice the difference (unless you intentionally want to feel which one is heavier).
* Noise cancelling
Unfortunately, in 2019 there isn't a headphone that cancels human voices perfectly. With NC on without playing music, I can still hear people talking. But it's difficult to tell what they are talking unless I concentrate on the conversation or the people are talking in a sharp voice. Some music can easily cover people's voice.
* Comparison with QC 35
I first tried QC 35 and got a headache after wearing it for minutes. Then I tried XM3 and felt that it was better (could be that I was already getting used to NC headphones). Anyway, there are more levels of ambient sound you can choose from compared with QC35. If full NC makes you feel uncomfortable, try let some ambient sound in, which may help.
I somehow believe the gestures on XM3 is cooler and I like using it. I don't like finding buttons on QC 35. XM3 can also optimize NC based on the atmosphere pressure and how you wear the headpone, which I don't think QC 35 can do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Compared to the MX2 which I used for over a year on many bus rides on Connecticut Transit system I have to say these are the best of its series. The noise cancellation improved greatly as I have asked people if I sound more clear on phone calls. I am not a fan of the Alexa integration, but it is an option that others will probably find useful if they own a line up of Alexa products. I prefer the google assistant as it has worked for me for years. Sound quality if you are integrating it with Sony;s Smartphone audio drivers and technology then it is superb. Do not expect it sound better on your cheap iPhone X for your phone does not possess these advanced audio features. I never really use it for gaming, because I have a PS4 Pro which does not integrate with it. However, as a music producer I can say these will definitely replace your studio headphones of the same price unless you have a  2000$ studio headphone this will suffice tremendously well. The Comfort has also so greatly improved as well. Much lighter and improved padding for the top of your head so when you have long media sessions you do not have to worry about feeling the metal band as it compresses over time. The XM3s are practically identical, but as I have described above these changes are what makes the XM3 by far the must have choice in this model lineup. 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It works well at canceling out low end deep noise. Higher tone things like people talking still cut through.

Build quality isn’t great, they feel really cheap and everything is plastic. I’d be surprised if they last a year.

The microphone is pretty useless.
It sounds Muffled and unclear to the person you’re talking to.

Charging cable is really short.

Feels hot and gets sweaty after being worn a couple hours.

The ear cups fold the opposite way of what would make sense.

Case looks ugly

Battery life isn’t anywhere near the 30 hours advertised.

Touch screen is annoying. It gets bumped on accident a lot when you take them off.

Changing the volume is hard, a lot of the time you skip tracks instead of adjusting volume.

Only one synced device at a time??","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

In comparison, these sony headphones are simply better.

Sound quality:  Quite wonderful.  The implementation of LDAC codecs was brilliant. Since I own an android phone, I am able to play HiFi songs and be amazed by the rich highs and mids.  Regardless, LDAC alone doesn't mean the sound will be awesome, but the headphones do matter. And these are some of the best Bluetooth headphones out there. (if not the best tbh).

Noise Canceling:  Quite great. I won't say it is perfect because it will NOT block every single sound, but it is up there as one of the very best noise-canceling headphones.  Noise-canceling headphones will have a mild ""pressure"" effect while listening, which can lead to some discomfort and headaches. These ones are no exception, but at least they don't seem too bothersome. Plus, one can easily disable the noise cancelation.

Build quality:  The HD1/Momentum 2.0 are very sturdy and even a little heavy. The ear cushions are leather and it feels quite premium to the touch. Also, the leather allows for a fresh and breathable experience.  The Sony headphones are made out of plastic, which may or may not break easily. So be careful with them and try not being TOO active while wearing these.  Other than that, the materials are good, the ear cushions are very soft, and the overall fit is comfortable.

Battery life:  I can wear these all day without worrying about the battery. If you charge these at night, you won't have issues listening to music during the day. I also LOVE the fact that these have a USB type C connector. which means that you can charge them quite fast.

Buy these and you'll notice the difference. I would highly advise buying these whenever there is a sale and the price drops lower than 300.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_35?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=35&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Gustafsson","Amazing noise cancelling","June 13, 2019","Just bought a second pair of these amazing headphones for my wife. Noise cancellation literally turns off everything else, people around me speak in inaudible whispers, the office A/C is gone, airplanes are silent. In my own world of little or no sound with these on. They are far better than anything I've owned in the past.

The only gripes I have are a) the ridiculously short charging cable. Buy a USB-C cable, too, if you buy one of these. It seems like they saved a cubic inch on the case, or so, by having a unusably short cable included; b) there's nothing 'silver' about the Silver variant, which is what I bought first. It's tan or beige, or very pale brown, but not 'silver.' Not unattractive, but if you think you're getting a silver-colored set, think again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_52?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=52&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Thru out the years I have spent more than $300 dollars on those cheap Bluetooth headphones and they always end up failing within months. This headphone in the other have been a joy to use.

Pros:
-noise cancelling is amazing, I have use these headphones on a C-17 flight and the ability to block the obnoxious noise of the plane is incredible.
-USB C, do I need to explain more ?
-Super comfortable for long hours of use
-battery life is really good on average 25+ of battery life between charges
- gesture controls works great
-pressing the power button will give you the battery % on a voice feedback
-noise cancelling controls on the left ear cup
-app for iOS and Android is decent, serve its purpose

Cons
-not free

However, I miss them every day and wish I could have found a use for them. If they have aptx LL, they would've been the perfect headset for me for my pc gaming. These are much better than the Plantronics backbeat pro 2, which I also tried. Those do have aptx LL but the comfort just isn't remotely close to how good the xm3 felt on my ears.

I love the sound of these headphones. They sound amazing. Accurate sound music and even calls.
The noise cancelling I love. (Warning) Once you take these off, everything sounds a bit loud, but I think that's a good thing. I was used to having everything be quiet.
I was on call with the gf, and she said the microphone was good, and she didnt really pick up on back ground noise. I think the reason why people say the mic is so bad is because when you have ambient noise ON, the microphone tries it's best to pick up all the noise you would hear (background noise) and play that in the headphones. I would see why they do that. The passive noise proof ear muffs do such a good job at keeping noise out that they have to play sound back through the microphones.
That isnt the minor thing that bugs me. It's that after long periods of time, the top of your head gets sore from the headphones. The cushion that contacts the top of my head is really soft, but it still gets to me. So if you have a long flight, you might have to adjust these to keep the soreness low on the top of your head.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_31?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=31&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sound quality is not far from an average Sony XB450. Bass not that deep but its generally okey. Controls work fine as expected . The only drawback i have noticed, when you connect the set using the 3.5MM connector direct to a laptop or a computer, you lose some sound quality.

I'm really, really trying to buy into bluetooth tech for headphones, but every single set I've bought has experienced audio dropouts with regularity under normal circumstances. In the case of these Sony headphones, sometimes I couldn't even turn my head without having the audio stutter.  Coming from wired headphones that never cut out, I'm not ready to compromise with tech that doesn't perform at least as good as what it's replacing. I'm not sure what to attribute the dropouts to. Maybe I should wait until Sony updates from bluetooth 4.2 to 5.0.

Overall, I was really excited to try these out. I waited a long time and ended up placing an order for these when shipping was estimated at a month away. When they work, they really work well! Sound quality is pretty good. As good as any closed set I've heard priced around $150. Active noise canceling on these in New York City isn't the silent oasis the Sony marketing materials make it out to be; there's still significant sound that leaks in whether your walking on the sidewalk or riding the subway. When used in an office, I can still clearly hear my coworkers talking 20 feet away from me. There's also an audible hum when ANC is turned on.

Controls were hit and miss. I can't understand why Sony continues to use the touch sensitive ear cups versus physical buttons. Buttons are easier, reliable, and there's no ambiguity when you click the buttons. The touch sensitive controls didn't always respond when I wanted them to, and sometimes responded when I didn't want them to. In my experience, I had to get the swipe up/down absolutely perfect in order to adjust the volume. I much prefer Bowers & Wilkens' implementation on their PX headphones.

Maybe my expectations were unrealistic. Am I expecting miracles? No. But for ~$400, I would expect a top tier experience without the compromises that I'd settle for in a set of $20 bluetooth headphones.

Given my experience, I can't recommend these.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Read the reviews from 2019 and night these. I was a violinist, a radio DJ and have an over 20K database of music.

First song - Have a Cigar. David Gilmour’s guitar is powerful and bell clear. The end of the song where the transition is from left to right is almost scary. The song feels like it’s coming from inside my head.

Second piece - Last movement of Beethoven’s 9, “Choral”. Each voice crystal clear. Minimal loss of highs and lows. Not overwhelmed by bass. Blow you away sound.

Third piece - Miles Davis - Freddy Freeloader off Kind of Blue. The trumpet and the piano are so crystal clear you can hear the fingers on the keyboard and Miles’s tone is classic.

Last piece- Mendelssohn Violin Concerto in E recorded by Jascha Heifetz. First movement. Picked because it is such an old recording. Granted it has been cleaned up. But it would be hard to tell that this isn’t new if you didn’t think about stereo as this was originally a mono recording.

These headphones are unreal. Expensive but worth it.

I have the silver and they do not look good at all. Terrible design with the control function that's located inside the right ear padding. It's very sensitive and if you don't swipe perfectly in the correct direction it ends up skipping songs or activating the Google Assistant. It's very aggravating. In order to change the volume you have to continually swipe  either up or down. And there's a slight pause between each swipe which makes it  take extra long  if you're in a hurry to switch up or down the volume. These headphones are definitely not worth the expensive price tag!

I got these headphones after returning another pair from another brand. Hoping that these headphones would not prove to be another disappointment, I eagerly fitted them onto my head. They were very comfortable, I immediately noticed. Much to my satisfaction, they felt lightweight and secure. I raised up my hand and pressed the power button.

""Power on.""

What came next was a captivating, eerie silence, the likes of which I rarely get to experience. I have a big family, and there is a constant chatter of activity in my house, but it could no longer reach my ears. I started playing some of my favorite music from my computer and began to experience the true depth of beauty that these songs possessed. I could detect artistic nuances and subtle melodies that I had never noticed before. This, however, was just the beginning.

It is now possible for me to sit in one of the noisy common rooms of my local college campus and listen attentively to the calculus demonstration on my computer, completely oblivious to the nearby fountain, air conditioning, and chatty students nearby. I can enjoy a relaxing evening on the balcony and not have to tolerate the traffic noise drowning out my music. While time and usage will truly test the value of this product, I am happy to report that so far, I am immensely happy with my purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_52?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=52&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I ordered the Bose QC 35 II's as an early Christmas gift to myself (December 2018). I've owned and loved my Bose QC 20 noise cancelling earbuds and was expecting nothing less from the more expensive flagship model. In deciding between the Sony's and the Bose, it helped that Bose dropped their price to $299 for the holidays.

The Bose QC's were extremely disappointing right out of the box. I followed all of the directions to the letter and downloaded the app. The noise cancellation was sub-par at best but I was dreading a lengthy return and stuck with them for another couple of days. The active noise cancellation never improved. I could hear an entire conversation happening next to me even with noise cancellation on at it's highest setting and music playing. These weren't even as good as my old Bose QC earbuds!!

Before returning them, I did some research and discovered that many, many, people were having issues with the QC 35 II's newest firmware update. Just Google it, the info is readily available. The most common complaint was degraded noise cancellation after upgrading the firmware. It was reported that there were no patches and no relief even if you installed an earlier firmware to your headphones.  That was the last straw and I decided I had to go with the Sony's even if they were a little more expensive.

Amazon gets major points for making the return process unbelievably easy and quick. (They processed the refund for Amazon credit before they even received the headphones back.)

------------
These headphones are an absolute dream. The active noise cancellation destroy the Bose by a healthy margin. They are both comfortable and light and the sound quality (to my ears) is also superior to the Bose. If you are looking for an experience that makes the world around you ""drop away"" then this is the pair for you. Battery life is excellent and being able to fast charge with USB-C aka your laptop charger is a game changer.

I was worried about call quality and the fact that you can't hook up two devices at once. I can report that the call quality is just average but wasn't a major deal breaker for me. The device switching issue is a flaw that I hope they will address in subsequent models. The reality is that it takes about 1 minute extra to switch between your laptop and phone. It's annoying but mainly a first world problem.

And no, the model I received doesn't feel like the band is going to crack.  I would pay the $11 to get insurance, though, just in case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was amazed at the quality of craftsmanship in design. They fit perfectly to my ears and head. Till I turned them on, I was already pleased with my purchase. Then with them on my head I turned them on. I was sitting ten feet to my tv and another five to the window A/C. Initially I thought the power went off in the house because it became very quite.

Quality is great for those situations.

However, these do not have the power that some cable/battery headphones have. I you want lots of bass and ""loudness"" these are not for you. And honestly no bluetooth headphones will have enough juice to produce incredible power. Might have to wait a couple more years for that tech to catch up.

Also, WILL NOT work for the gym if you do cardio and higher intensity workouts - they produce lots of sweat and get really wet really fast. If you just go to the gym and throw some weights around without breaking a sweat then sure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_36?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=36&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Price","Loving these Headphones - round 2","August 2, 2019","I purchased these headphones to replace my Bose Quiet Comfort 15s. I still have them. They still work but they are corded and I have been looking for a corded replacement when I caught these on PRIME Days sale.
What I like: the sound quality is awesome.  There is a button that allows you to toggle back and forth between ambient sound or noise cancelling.  When I listen to rock, the base and treble all come through clear and clean. I like the sound and noise cancelling more than my Bose Quiet Comfort 15s that I have had for years. I may have to put those in the drawer.
What I don't like: the app you need to load to use this headphone set is nothing special. I have also not figured out how to save my equalization settings so they stay (maybe user error).  There is another recommended app that is Sony approved that I have not used yet. I am out of space on my phone so stuck with this app.
Lastly, I gave it 4 stars because this is my second set. The first one did not hold a charge and I had to send it back. That is a big negative in my book.
Overall, like the choice and seems to be, to my ignorant ears, all that has been advertised.  Good job Sony because your Vaio is trash.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The problem is that it’s heavier but the issue--I believe--is that it’s not evenly distributed which causes pain on my temple even for a short time.

It's a hame, because the sound is better than Bose (not by much IMO) and it's USB-C!  in the end, though, if it’s not comfortable then it's a deal-breaker for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_194?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=194&reviewerType=all_reviews"

These headphone have an iphone app that makes connecting to the phone very easy but I use these headphones at work. I want to control my music from my computer. I have to go into my phone settings and turn off bluetooth there and then go into my computer settings and repair the headphones by turning off the headphones and then turning them back on with a long press. Then when I leave work I have to go back into my phone settings and turn bluetooth back on and turn my headphones off and then turn them back on with a long press of the power button.

Know what I did before? I plugged in the headphone jack.

Sony's help articles aren't clear and trying to reach out to customer service is difficult because they keep redirecting to community and help articles. Paying $300+ for headphones should allow me to reach a customer service agent with out this much trouble.

There are a lot of problems that need to be addressed though. Pairing went okay, but if you have two device(I have an iPad and iPhone) to switch between them you have to turn the blue tooth off on the device you don't want sound. Bose connection to two device is simple and you don't have to turn off blue tooth... just turn off the screen. The Google assistant app messes things up a bit too as it adds another bluetooth device. I got it going but then I wanted to watch football on the iPad so switched off bluetooth and things were messed up when I tried to use a second time. Decided the assistant was not worth the hassle until Sony catches up with Bose with such things. I'm still deciding whether to return the headphones or not. I do like the sound!!! It's better than Bose. Perhaps a firmware adjustment from Sony will help.

Pros:
+Great sound quality for a bluetooth headphone
+Great sound isolation that's superior to the QC35II (I own both pairs and have tested them side by side)
+Hand over ear cup gesture actually amplifies the outside environment when you need to hear what's going on

Cons:
-Headphone can only sync to one device. So if you are currently using your phone, you have to disconnect from your phone, then connect to the laptop or vice versa for audio output.
-Phone calls are of poor quality, with the person on the other end having difficulty hearing unless you're in an absolutely quiet environment.
-Touch controls does not offer tactile feedback like buttons, so you can never be sure if the headphone didn't register your command, or if something is wrong with the headphone, or if you didn't swipe the correct way.
-Touch controls does not work in the cold. Worse yet, it starts to register phantom swipes when temperatures approach freezing such as pausing the audio, skipping several tracks forward or backward, or turning the volume all the way down or up (ear shattering and very jarring).

The dealbreaker lies in the touch control, as I live in the Northern US and use this on my daily public transportation commute. Since there's no alternative forms of control, you have no option but to turn off the headphones and turn them back on to reset. Even then, it does not solve the issue 100% of the time. I returned them for another pair, and has the exact same issue occur. Friends who purchased this headphone also have the same complaint as well.

Do note that the temperature issue is not a manufacture defect affecting a small percentage of headphones. This is something that's rooted in the touch control interface, and affects all 1000XM3 headphones.

If you can live with the cons, then this is a great pair or headphones. For me, all the negatives are absolutely deal breakers. I had to switch back to using the QC35II.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_197?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=197&reviewerType=all_reviews"

These are just incredible!  If you can afford them, buy them!! The noise cancellation is unbelievable!  They are very comfortable, and with long battery life you’ll want to wear them all the time.  The sound is clear and crisp.  The only thing I don’t like is that if you connect to multiple devices, there is no easy switching, you have to disconnect from one and then connect to the other to get the sound.  And for some reason ambient noise is present when making phone calls, which is disappointing.

I had been eyeing the 1000XM2 for a while but had observed several challenges such as weight, ear pad comfort, etc. I was still about to pull the trigger when I read somewhere that the 1000XM3 was imminent, and held off.

After the big reveal, I ordered then here the day they were available for pre-order, and received them last week! So far the headphones have performed BEYOND my expectations. Except for one tiny little thing, which nevertheless turned out to be a major problem.

LIKE:
Phenomenal noise cancellation. I travel a lot and between time in cabs, at the airport and in flights accounts for 8-12 hours per week. Having these headphones have made those hours infinitely more bearable and am convinced that in the long run my hearing and ears will thank me! The engine roar is completely suppressed. Conversations are largely muffled. Close announcements are still clear but muffled. Crowd noise is completely suppressed.

Fantastic sound quality: Decent base, good amount of EQ. Not yet played a whole lot with the DAC. I will compare the DAC in the headphone wth the one in my V30 which I LOVE!

Ergonomics: Absolutely NO fatigue from wearing it for 4-5 hours at a stretch. No hot, red and sweaty ears, no hurting head due to too much clamping pressure. Just perfect.

HATE:
Sony engineers claimed that they dramatically improved the sound quality of calls. Well, not. They may have actually introduced a bug. Here's what I mean, and I really hope this is just a firmware bug and not a design defect. Whenever I am at the airport or cab, chances are, I will be in at least 3-4 phone calls.

On the 1000XM3, every time I receive a call over Bluetooth, the ambient mics inexplicably kick in. The caller can hear everything around my vicinity very clearly but can barely hear me. This becomes a HUGE deal since I am forced to keep my wired headset in a pocket and scramble around for it every time I'm wearing the XM3 and receive a phone call. Simply unacceptable. If there's no resolution found quickly, I'm afraid these have to go back. Will post an update here.","3.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I purchased both and entered the comparison with a slight bias in favor of the Bose, due to user reviews. I used both headphones for approximately 20 hours each, in varying environments and situations. Both are absolutely amazing headphones and to be perfectly honest, but in the end the Bose went back and the Sony's stayed. I tried the Bose first and the Sony's second. In the first 15 to 20 seconds, I had a shocked reaction and almost wanted to claw the WH1000XM3 off my head in disgust. The default sound profile was simply atrocious by comparison to the sound the QC35 ii produced. The difference was so stark that I almost sent the WH1000XM3 back on the spot, HOWEVER, I'm extremely glad that I did not do so. After playing with the equalizer and adjusting the profile, I was able to fine tune these babies to sound absolutely stellar. Bose sounded great out of the box but entirely lack an equalizer feature. The same thing can be said for various other features that have to first be enabled via the app. If you expect everything to be amazing out of the box and have an aversion to tinkering, the QC35 ii may be your better option. I for one am supremely satisfied with the WH1000XM3.

Pros:
- Equalizer and customizability
- Controls feel intuitive and are easy to get used to
- Covering the right cup with your palm temporarily negates noise canceling, if someone is trying to get your attention without forcing you to remove the headphones to engage in brief exchanges.

Cons:
- The Bose are ever so slightly more comfortable, not that these are ""uncomfortable"" they just lose out in the comparison.
- Bose has angled drivers, since I'll be replacing the pads on these for added comfort, both short comings can be negated with one cheap accessory purchase.

On the topic of noise cancellation:
I found that in certain environments the Bose noise cancelling performed better and in other environments the Sonys won. Bose seemed to deal better with monotone background noise, like fans, car sounds and wind. WH1000XM3 did better with voices and music as well as keyboard clicks for some unexplainable reason.

Hope this helps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Additionally, this next part is my fault because I should've read everyone's review first, but the headphone cannot connect to 2 devices at once. I know this might not be a big issue for some people, but it is for me because I work from my laptop and also pick up calls frequently, so it does get really annoying when I have to slide off the headphone back and forth just to talk. Also, the mic sounded muffled, so that's a big no-no for me when I'm picking up the calls for work. However, those are the problems for me and would probably have to return it and go with the Bose for my needs instead since I heard you can connect it to 2 devices, but still, I would highly recommend this headphone to others anyway because it sounds AMAZING!

I couldn't help it. I've tested them for a couple of weeks now, and I think I can give a good review by now.

They replaced my Bose QC25 headphones that I loved but that I wished to be wireless from time to time. Since I've used those headphones for years, my review is comparison between the two brands and is probably going to be helpful for people that are deciding between these and the Bose QC35 II (please note that every other headphone in this price range is just pale compared to these). Also, I don't know much about Bose 700 since I haven't tested them extensively, but most of the things that apply for their older version is probably true for these as well.

The Negatives:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Not as comfortable. They are very comfortable, but not as much as Bose. After a while I can feel them in the top of my head and I do feel the headphones in my ears. Bose are almost perfect here; I can use them for hours and hours and only get hot in the ears if the day is really warm.
- A little loose. The clamping force is a little lacking. When looking down or headbanging you can feel them move around and even fall. I didn't have this issue with Bose.
- Earpiece cushions harder to replace than Bose. After over a year of use my Bose cushions started wearing down until they finally broke. After a $12 dollar replacement purchase, I easily replaced them and they were as good as new. I don't know how much it'll take for these cushions to wear down, but when they do, it's going to be much harder AND expensive to replace (I've found the replacement cushions at $50 and I've been told they are not as good affecting the noise cancelling quality).
- Single button to turn on, off and get into pairing mode. It's not a major issue, but having to press for two seconds to turn on/off and seven to get into pairing mode is not great. With Bose after a while you automate the motion of removing and turning of the headphones in one move. I've forgotten to turn these off more often than not because of that which of course impacts battery usage since they are on while they are still connected to a device. You basically waste hours of battery because of this. Pressing for two seconds might not sound awful, but it's that compared to a switch interaction of instant results.
- Bluetooth management!!!! This is were this headphones are really poor compared to Bose. They cannot connect to several devices at once, and to switch you must somehow cut the connection with the other device. So, to connect to a device you had already connected to, you need to manage at least 2 devices but most often that not 3. You need to cut the connection from the headphones to the previous device (either turn off the device's Bluetooth or press the On/Off button for 7 seconds to enter pairing mode) and then grab the other device and connect them to the headphones. Bose products have a memory of connections, once connected, the device will remember and to connect to a device you only need to single press the Bluetooth button; the headphones will announce a device name, and if you wait the headphone will connect to the device (as long as it has Bluetooth on of course). If you deal with several devices at once like phones, tablets and computers, Bose approach is unquestionably better; if you only use one device or don't mind using the cord for the others, this is no real issue. For me, if I had known, it would have probably been a deal breaker. I just thought that Bose's way was the standard. Also... Bose products connect to 2 devices simultaneously.

The Great and awesome:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

+ Sound quality! In general very similar to the QC series, but with better base. These sound slightly better than Bose which is an impressive feat. Getting either one of these headphones spoil you and ruin every other headphone.
+ USB-C for rapid charging. It's great to know that little time of charging will allow you to use the headphones for a very decent amount of time. Probably more than necessary until there's actually time to properly charge them.
+ Touch controls for Media controls are really great. That is way more comfortable than having to double or triple press a button to do a trivial task.
+ Standard 3.5mm headphone jack!!!! It may sound stupid, but it's great to know that you are guaranteed an easy and quick replacement for the cable if needed. Cables should be able to provide even better sound quality than the best Bluetooth transmission algorithms. Weather that's noticeable with this headphones I don't know. But you can get a cord as long as you want for this headphones whereas with Bose you are basically stuck with the provided length since they use a 2.5mm jack.
+ Outstanding noise-cancelling capabilities. Probably the best I've experienced so far.
+ Outstanding Battery life! Batteries were never an issue for me with the Bose because I had 4 rechargeable batteries that I rotated fairly easily. The battery included with these headphones lasts a really long time (20 to 30 hours) so I don't usually find myself in the need of recharging them when I wanted to use them the most.
+ I'm not going to continue describing good things, because that's what the product description is for.

Hope this helps.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

V8, V6, for decades sony has been my number 1 choice. Unfortunately these noise cancelling over bluetooth I can't even stand for more than a few hours. There is an extremely subtle constant audio pressure on my eardrums, unmistakable, due to the cancelling feature. It's like I'm in a pressure chamber for my ears. Very uncomfortable. Then there is the sound quality - many reviewers give this phone a 10 but I'd rate it no more than a 5 on sound reproduction. The uper end is totally gone, and the equalization function available on the phone doesn't help it. All clarity is lost in my opinion. Returned the set.

Sound quality: Right out of the box to me the Bose QC35 II are the obvious winner for balanced reference sound quality, and this advantage is even greater because Bose apparently applies the Fletcher-Munson curve based on the volume (the lower the volume, the more bass and treble, based on well-established princples of hearing).

BUT WAIT: It's not so simple as that! The Sony's come with an app with a really nice equalizer. The Sony's right out of the box are too bass heavy for me, full stop. Nice, smooth, even, spectacular, and TOO MUCH bass. So what to do? Go into the equalizer in the app and turn down the ""clear bass"" by 2 to 5 units, depending on your taste and your normal listening level. Maybe tweak the 6.3 khz slider up one or two units and turn the 16 khz slider up to taste. If you know what you're doing, you can design your own sound!

Noise Cancelling: Sony XM3 wins. Read everyone else's review for details.

Comfort: It depends! If I am using the XM3s in a noisy environment (for me, the subway), they are much more comfortable. When the QC35 II's noise-cancel big-time noise they make my ears feel weird. Around home, the Bose's are more comfortable because they don't need to work so hard at noise cancelling. The Bose are lighter and leave my ears cooler. However, because the earpads of the XM3 are flush with the plastic earcups, I find the Sony much more comfortable and stable for lying down! Think about what you are going to do with these!

Controls: I was surprised to find I much preferred the touch-pad controls of the Sony to the mechanical controls of the Bose. The Bose requires more stillness and dexterity for me. When I use the Bose I really miss just tapping twice to pause the Sony's or to put my hand over the right earcup of the Sony's to instantly reduce the volume and let outside sounds in or just swiping up or down to turn the volume up or down. On the Bose side, Bose seemingly remembers all devices for pairing and connection (I’m sure there’s a limit but I haven’t hit it). Sony seems to only remember one device for connection and pairing. This makes the Bose a lot more convenient if you use more than one device as a source. These are big convenience differences.

For mom around the house I would suggest the Bose. Except for someone who wants to lie down and maybe fall asleep at home or in a hotel with headphones on I would choose the Sony. For a techie sound guy I would suggest the Sony. For a musician I would suggest the Bose. For a commuter subject to sounds like subway noise I would suggest the Sony. Overall result: TIE, both are amazing, but if you can only get one, choose carefully--there are BIG differences!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_195?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=195&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After that the audio is smooth sailing. App is nice for granular control of sound quality, noise-canceling and ambient sound. On par with Bose, which was my go-to for noise-canceling but their offering kept clipping out three or four times per song and I lost patience.

Cons:
--When moving from a warm indoor enviroment to a cold one (say, Boston in February) the touch controls on the right earcup become more than merely useless. They actually cause music to skip forward, backward, tracks skip all over, volume goes up and down, etc. The solution, which is a bit of a pain but has resolved it for me, is to turn off the headphones once you get outside for a minute and then turn them back on. This recalibrates the touch controls and you're set for the duration of time the headphones are outside.

-- the Google Personal Assistant configuration is impossible though I'm not sure if it is Google or Sony to blame here. I speak commands to the headphones (after saying ""Hey, Google"" to get the Assistant app open). My spoken commands transcribe, no problem, but nothing happens. The commands go nowhere. This brings me to my next complaint:

-- Firmware won't update. Using the iOS app, I tried updating the firmware but it never downloads. Just hangs at ""0% downloading"" and never either starts the download or indicates that the download has failed. Tried doing this from home and work to no avail. I've since opened a support ticket with Sony. Hopefully they can get me sorted.

It's no great shakes for me to lose the assistant function. I really just wanted a decent pair of Bluetooth noise-canceling headphones and these do the trick nicely if you are willing to tolerate the cold-weather reboots.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

USB type C is really good compared to Bose and the app is really good and steps ahead of bose again. Lack of physical buttons for volume is kind of annoying since the touch wont respond if you are wearing gloves and the like. I do wish there was a dedicated mute instead of double tapping to pause since i couldn't get that function to work with google music on my computer.

Speaking to computer functionality, that seems half backed and if you are using this on your computer I would consider something else. The main thing that killed this headset for me was lack of multiple device connection. I am a 70/30 computer user. I use this device on my computer 70% of the time while I code. The other 30 is for my phone and having to unpair and re-pair is really annoying. I have 4 year old jaybirds that allow multiple bluetooth connections and how this headset doesn't have that perplexes me.

In the end I could not justify the sacrifices I had to make in order to use this head set. Given the price there is no way I was happy with that. Having an app or better integration with PC on top of allowing multiple connections would have made this 5 stars. As it is now, the sacrifices don't justify the price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

For $300 I was hesitant since I've never used any NC headphones other than those. When I first used these I thought the NC was kind of lacking for $300, but after using it for a bot it is definitely on par or slightly better than the other headphones I've used. They're WAY more comfortable compared to the on ear NC headphones I used before, and I would say that these Sony headphones are more comfortable than most gaming headsets I've used also.  Overall it's a purchase that I don't think I will regret.

When you get these, make sure to hold the power button for a few seconds to pair with a device.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_39?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=39&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They completely malfunctioned on takeoff and a bit on landing. There was heavy static coming out of both ears, so bad had to remove them. It was a sharp painful sound. Happened on landing as well but not quite as bad. I haven’t been able to find anyone with similar issues yet. Not sure if I’m just unlucky or it’s going unreported.

This is super disappointing, it took me over a year to finally pull the trigger and buy what I thought was a good pair of noise cancelling headphones. Cannot recommend these at all sadly.

I noticed the noise cancelling aren’t quiet as good as my wife’s XM2’s maybe because they fit tighter, but I can hear a normal conversation easily while in noise cancelling mode, and after doing the setup.

Also had some volume issues while on iPhone 10xs, not very loud at max volume then an hour later I was able to turn them up more. Hopefully will be fixed with software.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The headphone is well built and lasts a long time per charge (1-2 days of heavy listening, 1 week of casual listening).

A few things that I would nit pick about:
 - Included charging cable is very short
 - Bluetooth pairing can get annoying if you want to use it with multiple devices
 - Sometimes a popping sound comes from the ear cups
 - Touch controls sometimes don't work in cold weather
 - ambient noise feature is a bit finicky

I was impressed by its effectiveness. I'm no audiophile, but these headphones sound like a pretty serious ""step up"" most other headphones I own.

I'd say that wearing this set of headphones for a long period of time feels a bit uncomfortable, but I don't think it's due to the sound cancelling.

For reference, I have a few random headsets and headphones:
* Bose QC15 (bose are slightly more comfortable than the sony -- maybe it's my headshape, but after a while the sony feels like they're clamping my head just a bit tighter and the bose are just a little bit lighter... obviously the QC15 model has a cord though)
* Hyper X Cloud Flights (a bit more comfortable than those)
* Logitech G933 (lots more comfortable than those)

Most bluetooth headsets I've owned (some no-name earbuds/headphones) have also had really obscure pairing rules. I think Sony's done the best job I've seen with that. Simplest bluetooth pairing experience I've had to date.

Volume and other controls on the right side of the headphones are a bit difficult to distinguish though. There's several times I've accidentally changed volume because I touched my headphones on accident, and other times I've paused or something when I just wanted to change the volume. I think there could be some improvement there to make the touch controls a bit more discrete.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_31?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=31&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They're a good product and worked well.  As a business traveler, being able to drown out airplane engines and other noises made flights far more productive and more relaxing.  I started to see cracking of the rubber guard around where the cable entered and exited the little battery pack so I decided to look for a new solution.  I did a lot of research comparing the top of the line Sony to the top of the line Bose and decided to go with Sony.  Many reviews gave the node to Sony for it's noise cancelling properties.  I also like how long the battery lasts and how much of a charge you get with just a little charging time.  And I LOVE the feature where you can place your hand over the right ear piece and the noise cancelling and music shuts off so you can hear an announcement or someone talking to you.  Remove your hand and everything is back on in an instant.  They're comfortable and I wear glasses so I wondered how'd they'd feel but they're great.  I find myself wearing them in the airport waiting on flights; with or without music playing just to feel more peaceful.  I've used them for phone calls and asked several people how the call sounds on their line and everyone has said it's good.  I like that they come with cables if you want to skip the blue tooth and that they also include the adapter needed to use with the airline entertainment centers on overseas trips.  Sound quality is great; a tip is to use the EQ function with the music app on iPhones!  They're expensive but if you travel as much as I do for work, they really make all of that travel more bearable and more productive!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have the WH1000XM3's (black).  It's as if you go straight into a sound chamber and outside noise is drastically reduced.  I know you may be saying 'well of course.. that's what noise cancelling means!'  However, knowing something and then experiencing it are two different things.  To be honest, I think my mind is trying to figure these headphones out still... I get some ringing in my ears and I learned that that can be from the mind compensating for a perceived hearing loss.  I think some part of my auditory perception is thinking there is something missing in these environments where I would normally hear a certain degree of noise!

Again, I risk sounding obvious but you really have to try these to understand what i mean.  I have a great workplace to test the efficacy of these headphones out: a coworker in the next cubicle who noisely eats/gulps/drinks/munches and crunches on food and snacks  incessantly throughout the day (was driving me nucking futs) and right now we have an A/C issue in the office that requires us to have some kind of industrial swamp cooler contraption as a substitute and it sounds similar to that droning noise that can be heard during air travel from the engines.  I know... but I gotta pay the bills!

When I put on the WH1000XM3's, both of those noises are substantially reduced which is a godsend to me.  Then I add in some low volume classical or dub techno and I am in my own little world!  I can focus, relax.. well to the extent that that is possible at work... and the great feature of being able to cup my hand over the right ear cup is fantastic.  It seems to not only cut out the noise cancelling so I can hear a legitimate request from my coworkers, but there seems to be a bit of enhancement.. maybe I am just imagining that though.

I have also tested these out and about, walking and such...there are so many opportunities for me to experience noise pollution in the city I live in!  I can say that I have finally been able to hear a very soft-spoken pod-caster for the first time without having to increase the volume whenever he spoke during his interviews on his podcasts.  Even while walking by noisy traffic/people/construction ....and does anyone else notice the higher volume and pitch of ambulances and other emergency vehicles these days?  Those noises were countered very effectively, although some bangs and loud noises seemed to make the noise cancellation compensate a bit too much, still I would rather not hear the offending noises and so the slight interruption to my listening experience during those brief moments is tolerable.

They also adjust to less noisy environments too: in the early hours of the day, when its almost completely quiet in the environments I'm in at that time, the cancelling drops off and I can hear my car door closing behind me/alarms for forgetting to take the key with me/leaving the headlights on, etc.

The battery life is also another pleasant surprise.  I have doubted manufacturer's claims on battery life, but these really did hold up for close to 30 hours, I have to qualify this by saying that I mostly listen to low-volume classical/techno dub/e-courses/podcasts and the like.

Comfort and wearability are quite high.  I can stand to have these on for three to four hour stretches at a time and probably go longer if I am on a long flight and desperate to get some sleep.  I did try a 45 minute nap with white noise playing and it worked wonderfully.  I have tried wearing the headphones upside down, and they hold on just fine, especially helpful for keeping a lower profile at work, not so obviously 'tuning you jerks out.'  In the heat of the day, out walking, the ear-cups can feel warm (70-80 degree temps) but not too bad.

Ok, now the cons: there were a few glitchy moments with the swiping feature on the right ear-cup and one time where the volume control from the swiping did seem delayed or slow, however I must say that was when I was transitioning from sitting for an extended time at work and then going out for a walk on a break, no excuses, but it was not show stopper, it just took a minute or two for the headphones to 'figure it out.'  There was also a moment where I was sure that I was swiping the volume down but the skip track forward feature triggered instead.

Overall though, I would highly recommend these headphones, especially if you were like me and trying to listen to instructional videos/podcasts for any length of time and you need to focus better.  I think they are far healthier for my hearing as well: the noise cancelling allows me to play background music at super low volume whereas the in-ear earbuds are just terrible (as I now realize in comparison).","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews"

At the end we kept the Sony, mainly because of all the cool sound options.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_74?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=74&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I decided it was time to upgrade, but these WH1000XM3 aren't the upgrade I was looking for.  I had to return them.

First, the good:  Good sound, excellent noise canceling.  App finally provides a control to turn off the annoying voice assist that is constantly telling you what button you just pushed.

Now the bad:  Build quality is way down from the older versions.  The earcups and touchpad are plastic, not nice leather anymore.  The touchpad itself is frequently non-responsive; not a problem I had with the previous version.  I found myself punching my own ear just to try to get it to register a tap.  And that was indoors - but take them out in the cold and it's as bad as everyone says.  They are unusable in the cold and will freak out and act crazy.  Sony's official stance on this is ""they're not meant to work in sub-freezing temperatures"" but a) they break down way before it's that cold and b) the old ones - and literally any other headphone you can buy - work fine well below freezing.  Also, they have fewer buttons and less ability to control the headphones without needing to use the companion app, which is annoying to have to dig out a phone and long load times just to perform basic functions.  The old ones had a button of noise canceling, a button for audio pass-though, and you could long-press the touchpad for Google assistance.  The new ones, you can choose one of those three things to assign to the sole button, and the rest you can't do.

So yeah.  I returned them and bought the B&W PX headphones instead.  The sound is better.  The noise canceling is worse, but I can give that up for all the benefits they provide -- like controls that actually work.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

On the one hand, I don't have a point of comparison. These are my first legit over-the-ear, intended-for-real-listening headphones that didn't cost $20 or less. So, in that case, it's an incredible listening experience. You know that expression, ""Mind Blown""? Yeah, that. These sound amazing.

On the other hand, is there really a point to compare? The reviews have said it all. Top in class active noise cancellation. Great sounding headphones. Support for aptX-HD for CD-level clarity. What's not to like about a set of cans like this? And yet, I've already encountered a couple of issues -- nit-picks really:

1) I have already wanted to use it with another Bluetooth device, but hesitated because I know that it can't be paired with more than one device at a time. I know that the Bose QC II do that. These don't. Is it a deal-breaker? Not really. Just a mild inconvenience.

2) The HD quality sound is great. However, if you want to alter the sound stage. Change a setting on the equalizer. Change the surround. You can't opt for the headphones to prioritize sound quality. Did that make sense? Let me say it again: ""You can't prioritize sound quality AND change the sound stage."" Some might say that they are mutually exclusive. You choose one or the other. While others might want to have audio quality AND adjust the audio to their own sound palette.

3) Coding the Hard Button is odd. Why give one button three options? What if I want Google Assistant/Alexa AND ANC control?

4) Touch controls are great, but not consistent. The worst offender here is the palm mute. What has been described as a simple cupping of the headphone will allow ambient sounds come through, but the palm has to physically be on the whole of the touch pad. Again, not a deal-breaker, but not as magical as it is described.

5) It's plasticky and feels plasticky. I don't know how else to describe it.

Some qualifiable things:

a) No perceived latency with videos that I can tell. Lips are in sync with audio. I know some people have said there are issues. For what it's worth, I'm running this through a OnePlus 6T which supports aptX;

b) listening comfort is good. These fit my ears great, but I know that won't be true for everyone. My ears did get a bit warm, but that's to be expected I suppose.

Other than that, other non-qualitative factors, like range, it's good. I can have my phone in the basement of my house and walk all around the home, including to the top floor, opposite end of the house, and still have crystal clear audio.

After all that's written here, do I regret this purchase? Absolutely not. There's a wealth of great videos out there comparing these with others by those who've used its competitors. I don't doubt anything that they've said. So, I am sure that I have either the best or second-best headphones on the market. After using them, I don't have any reason to doubt those claims. You won't be disappointed that's for sure!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The one downside I would say is the touch controls ever the right ear, in the first few weeks I frequently skipped or paused a song involuntarily because I touched the headphones by mistake.

It was never painful, but at first a bit annoying.  Also like many other reviews, after using them for about a week it seemed to be less apparent less often.  I would probably have been fine keeping Bose QC 35 M II (maybe) - they were a gift and are quite nice.  However, I decided to try the Sony's in order to make a more informed choice.

1) I found the Sony's to be a bit less comfortable around and on the ear, because the cushions are not as thick as the Bose and the foam of the inner part of headphone rests on your ears.  The Bose by contrast had thick pads that held the inner part of the earphones completely off your ear.  I would compare it to wearing a cozy pair of slippers (Sony's), v.s. a light-weight loose fitting soft cotton shirt (Bose).  I preferred the Bose on this point.
2) I did find the clamping pressure of the Sony's to be a bit too much, and preferred the Bose for comfort on this level as well.
3) I also liked that the Bose had an on/off switch where as the Sony had a button that did not physically change position based on whether the unit was on or off.  The Sony swipe controls may also take a little more getting used to but in the end may be more convenient.
4) On the ANC, I found the noise cancelling on the Sony's to be superior.  I work in an office with very loud ventilation and the Sony's were noticeably quieter (confirmed by a co-worker).  I haven't tried them on a plane yet, but I'm going to assume they will be better there as well - and if not they should be plenty adequate.  With the Sony's I did notice some initial moments where there was a higher pitch background noise that would come on and off a few times, then it went away - perhaps the system needed a little time to get straightened out.  I also did not notice the pressure on the eardrums that I observed with the Bose.
5) I'm not an audiophile, so they both sounded good to me.  Perhaps the Sony's were better, as I did feel a little bit more immersed in what I would describe as a richer sound with the Sony's.

In summary, Bose were more comfortable on the ear surface and on the head.  Sony's had better noise cancelling, and did not create the pressure on the eardrum that I experienced with the Bose.  Sound I tip my hat to Sony.  Both very nice, and if you have a ton of money, or fly A LOT, or someone gifts them to you, (and you are ok with the eardrum pressure of the Bose) then you will likely be happy with either.

Update:  5/3/2019 - Still happy with my decision to go with the Sony's over the Bose, but the Bluetooth connectivity is annoying.  The Bose allowed you to be simultaneously connected to more than one device over Bluetooth.  The Sony's do not, and furthermore to get the Sony's to pair with a new device, you have to physically turn the Bluetooth on the currently connect device off.  Bose is definitely superior on the ease of Bluetooth connectivity.  I would imagine Sony's issues can be solved with firmware, as opposed to requiring different hardware (I could be wrong).  If that is the case, Sony needs to pay attention to this and step their game up.  In my opinion this improvement would put them clearly in the lead against Bose in the wireless ANC headphones race.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

First off, it supports several bluetooth codecs such as SBC, AAC, aptX, aptX HD and LDAC. From what I read, you get a (supposedly) superior sound quality (over bluetooth) if you configured your Sony WH-1000XM3 to use LDAC.  LDAC is an audio coding technology developed by Sony that enables the transmission of High-Resolution (Hi-Res) Audio content, even over a Bluetooth connection. LDAC sound quality is supposed to be better than CD quality but to be honest, from my experience I cannot tell any sound quality difference between SBC codec (which is the basic coding standard for most Bluetooth devices and is present in almost in every device by default) and LDAC codec. In any case I opted to configure the headphone to use LDAC (just because) and tweak my smartphone to get the sound quality that I want.

So how does one do that? I installed the Sony Headphones Connect app for Android and set the following parameters.
""Sound Position Control"" = OFF.
""Surround (VPT)"" = OFF.
""Equalizer"" = OFF.
""Sound Quality Mode"" = PRIORITY ON SOUND QUALITY.
""DSEE HX"" = OFF.

Then from my smartphone (Galaxy S7) and set  the following parameters:
System EQ to ""flat"".
Go to Developer Options> set Bluetooth Audio Codec Streaming = LDAC.
Go to Developer Options> set Bluetooth Audio Sample Rate = 96.0 kHz.  I played some music from my Amazon Prime Music and the audio quality was flat (eventhough Sony claims LDAC was better). TO GET THE SOUND QUALITY I WANT FROM MY MUSIC, I have to adjust my smartphone system EQ (not the Sony app EQ since that can't be change when using LDAC or AptX).  Or use SBC and adjust the Sony EQ until you achieved the sound quality to your liking.

Bottom line: By default the Sony WH-1000XM3 sound is a bit flat with a little bit of bass. Now you can change that by selecting a desired bluetooth codec and adjusting either your smartphone system EQ or the Sony app EQ. Which is really moot because one can argue that you can buy a less expensive headphone and tweak your smartphone to get the same result.

ALSO... if you ever use the headphone and pair it with your PC or any bluetooth devices, the EQ settings you configured to get that sound you like, is not saved in the headphone unless you use SBC codec.

The noise canceling is fantastic. It does not totally eliminates the noise but you can tell the difference, and you can drown out all the noise if you adjust your music up a little. I have not tested the audio call quality since I didn't buy the headphone for that purpose and I don't really talk  on the phone that much.

Hope this helps.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I work in a very noisy environment that would probably, eventually, cause hearing problems.  I put these on and don't even think about the noise now.  Bluetooth is playing, at various levels of loudness, and I can place a call, and people can actually hear me and understand what I'm saying.  I don't care much for the ""invisible"" controls, and if you order a pair, better order one of those new USB type cables, because the 9ne they give you is ridiculous; less than a foot long.  I can wear these for a long time and forget that I'm even wearing them.  They cost ALOT, and for me, worth every dime.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I use them regularly for calls in crowded coffee shops and they are fine for audio quality. Absolutely fantastic for air travel. Unfortunately they started crashing and shutting down and I had to warranty them out. The service department kept insisting I factory reset my headphones, even when I indicated I had already tried that multiple times. Third time contacting support they finally agreed to a warranty replacement. The support tech couldn't enter in a DPO address into the system, so now I have to ship them to my parents and wait over a month for a replacement.

Pros:
Variety of options in the app
If the ANC on the Bose makes you queasy, in all probability you will like these (and vice versa)
Controls are pretty good
Cons:
Slightly uncomfortable when put around the neck, but actually more comfortable than the Bose at this (for my neck)
The “silver” color is actually more of a bronze/gold

I downloaded the android app - definitely do that if you're using android. Wow, how cool.  Adapts to sounds around you instantly, controls the pressure in your ears, can be adjusted say mid flight.  Sound quality with ANR is fantastic.  I paired this with my Note8 and with the adaptive sound in the Samsung music app, it will test your hearing, amplify what you can't hear well.  THEN pair that with these.  Oh My GOD.  I was listening to Bohemian Rhapsody and I heard a voice sort of to my left rear singing a whole other track that I'd barely ever noticed before.
ANR:  WOW.  I just flew over the weekend in a crowded 737 with kids.  I put these things on and POOF!  The plane, the people, the intercom EVERYTHING just becomes a quiet background noise at best.  Turn on the music and you cannot hear ANYTHING else.  LOVE LOVE LOVE these!!!!  Anxiety dropped by a factor of 10 by just drowning out the noise.  Best ANR on the market.  I tested these against the Bose Q3 or whatever because they were in the airport.  I put their ANR on max and mine on max.  I could still hear everything, though quieter with the Bose.  Mine?  POOF! gone.

These headphones are amazing. If that's not convincing enough, they're well worth the price, too. I listen to music every day, and these have the wonderful sound quality I was looking for. They sound great out of the box, but if you spend a few minutes in the optional (but highly recommended) companion app, you can tailor the sound to your liking for an unmatched experience. The noise cancelation is phenomenal. It won't block out voices, but it's not meant to. It blocks road noise out perfectly. Extremely comfortable too. I have a large head and I can wear these for a full day without fatigue.

This headset is wireless and can be used with the included cable if desired. The headphones also include the NFC Pairing feature. You can just tap your phone flat on the left ear cup and it will pair automatically. The touch control on the right ear cup is a bit hard at the start, but once you get used to it, it's hard to live without. And the headphones also have a feature where you can cover the right ear cup with your hand and it let's outside noise in. It works very smoothly and very quickly.

These headphones are very versatile when it comes to types of music. With a few adjustments in the app, they can go from shimmering classical to loud metal to powerful hip hop. The app let's you adjust every characteristic of the sound you could possibly want. On the physical side of things, they're made of plastic with a soft touch type texture. They don't scratch easily though. They're very flexible and the ear cups are extremely soft, but not so soft they collapse onto your ears. They come in a carrying case that is one of the best I've seen. It is very small and can fit everything you need. I even fit a charging brick in the pocket inside.

If you have the money and are serious about buying these, don't talk yourself out of it. I couldn't recommend these any more. I have let a dozen or so people try these with varying genres of music and they all agreed with everything I've said. I would buy these again if they got lost or broke, but these are so durable I don't see that being an issue.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_50?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=50&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I tried the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones in the store and I didn't think their noise cancelling was that great. So I watched some Youtube product reviews and gave these a shot. I don't know if my expectations were just much higher, but honestly its not like they cancel out a ridiculous amount of noise. I can still hear everything around me it's just dampened. Definitely not cancelled, and honestly it doesn't do that much for me even when working in the office I can still hear every ones chatter, people walking around me. Opening and closing of doors. It's not cancelling that much noise. The Bose did a worse job, but it makes you wonder. The most annoying thing about these headphones is the fact they can't pair with more than 1 device at a time. Every time I go from my apple laptop to my Linux desktop it takes at least 15 minutes every-time because I always have to re-pair them. If I didn't have to re-pair them every-time this wouldn't be an issue. It really sucks. The only thing that is keeping me from giving these headphones 2 stars is the sound quality is pretty good, battery life is good, and they feel comfortable to me. Honestly, in hindsight I probably would have been better buying some headphones for $100-$150.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I previously had the Bose QC35's and the XM3's have dethroned the previous king.

Noise-cancelling:  Better than Bose, more adjustable to different environments, allows flexibility with which sounds to block.

Sound Quality: I seriously thought I was losing my hearing since there were some sounds that I didn't hear when listening to my QC35's.  Nope, it just turns out that they didn't have great high frequency response.  The XM3's have better highs and lows, and the separation of sounds is fantastic.

Here's the most important part: using the XM3's with an Android phone you can use Sony's lossless LDAC connection.  This means you have 3x more bandwidth over bluetooth.  The result is a huge difference in sound quality vs a normal bluetooth connection.  They also support Apt X HD, but I don't know of any phone that actually supports that codec yet.  The only issue with LDAC is that it will drain your battery faster, but if you have high quality FLAC music on your device, you won't want to miss out.

Call Quality: I've never had an issue with call quality or disconnects.  Sounds clear as a bell and I can walk and talk just fine.

Comfort: As with all over-the-ear headphones, they can get a little warm, but it's nothing that can't be managed.  As for the cups, they are incredibly soft and pliant.  I hope they don't wear out quickly.  The cross bar is comfortable and barely noticeable.

All in all, I can't think of a reason to dislike these headphones.  Although my wife enjoys my hand me down QC35's, she's quite jealous over the hands free controls on the XM3's (which is amazing and intuitive).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_38?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=38&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I am so happy that I went with the Sony's. The sound quality is amazing, the build is amazing and the mobile app offers a wide variety of sound customization options. The only negative thing that I would have to say about these is the lack of Windows/Mac app. If Sony were to provide an app for computers with the same level of sound control as the mobile app then these would be the perfect pair of headphones. I would advise anyone who is on the fence between the Bose and these to look at spec/feature sheets of the two side-by-side.

I go through headphones every 6 to 12 months.  Since music and audiobooks are a big part of my life, I'm willing to spend a dollar a day for quality sound.
These headphones are nice and light.  They don't clamp your head like a vice.  Sound is superb, when temperatures and car travel aren't involved.
I don't think these last the 30 hours advertised.
They are sweatier than any other brand I've used; Anker, Cowin, Sony 950bt, and others.
Noise cancelling is amazazazing.  I work with snowmobiles, chainsaws, gas augers, etc., so this aspect is important.  It fails however in unlikely situations.  Driving in our Alaskan bumpy roads, you can hear the sound clip when you hit a bump.
The deal breaker with these cans is that they malfunction in the cold.  I've noticed that the problems start at anything below 10 degrees f.  This is the 2nd pair I tried.  It will start to think I am pressing the ambient or google function button.  Then, depending how much colder below 10f, it will think I'm clamping my jand over the right earcup, and cut the sound thinking I jave my hand cupped over the right can, so the sound cuts to inaudibility.
I wanted to like these.  I wanted to love them.  But, the idea of them doesn't stand up to what cold Alaska has left to offer.
The good news is that for most of you southerners is that these are auditory ecstasy.  Be warned, for Minnesota and north... look elsewhere.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So why 2 stars? The build quality is not good. All the circuitry is encased in crappy plastic leading to the legs breaking easy. I first owned a WH1000MX1 on which the leg broke after accidentally falling asleep with them on. Okay I thought, its weird that the headphones broke but it was probably my fault for falling asleep with them.

Decided to buy these to upgrade, and within two months, they also broke. This time though I have a hard time taking blame -- I was walking my dog, and flipped the headphones off my hears and onto my neck as someone was walking by. After chatting with the person, I go to put the headphones back on to see the plastic leg is broke, and the right ear cup is dangling by a cable.  I will note, the headphones, as with my prior MX1s, technically still work -- they circuitry is intact. The problem is I have to wrap em in electtical tape to get them to stay on my head.

I'm really sorry but I don't want to wear $400 headphones that require electrical tape to stay in one piece.

If you're the type that babies their headphones, you might never run into this issue. If you're like me and use your headphones everywhere, they need to withstand a slight shove from the ear to the neck.

Went ahead and bought older model Sennheiser Momentums, and while the noise cancelling isnt as good, the build quality blows these out of the water.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The call quality thing was a known issue, but it sounded like it might have been fixed. It has not. My WH1000MX3's arrived yesterday (2/27/2019) and they immediately asked to be updated which I did and it was a very long process. After the update, I listened to a few choice ""sound quality"" music selections and so far, so good. Took them to work today and started off the morning enjoying the quite stunning ANC and listening to tunes whilst I toiled. And then, I got a phone call. I could tell the client was mystified as to where I was so I quickly switched from the headphones to my AirPods. ""Ah, that's better. Where were you?"", he said. I explained about the new headphones and he said, ""They sound AWFUL!"" I then tried another call from a quite room to my Mom. She was also confused as to where I was calling from. I switched to the iPhone itself and she said, ""That's better!"" Finally, I called Sony Tech Support, explained what was going on then switched from iPhone to headphones. He said, ""Oh yes, I hear what you mean."" After about 5 minutes of going through all of his troubleshooting references he said there was no published fix for the issue and he would be happy to replace them with another pair. I told him I would just return them to Amazon.

So, as others have stated: These headphones sound really good. The ANC is stellar. They are comfortable. If you want to use them for phone calls, look elsewhere. They are really bad at that.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The sound quality is great, the ambient sound feature is quite enjoyable and the fact it can connect to my TV is pretty dope.

Allen","Has what I want, missing what I NEED","October 23, 2019","Pros: looks cool (I got silver-really more champagne color which is good), bass & noise canceling is on point, extra features (cover ear to pause nc, extra sound options in the app, usb c) also on point

Cons(and why I went with qc35ii): you cannot connect to more than one device at a time and switching between devices is cumbersome and annoying af, touch controls(accidentally skipping tracks when trying to adjust volume, read from others they don’t work well in the cold, accidentally pausing when adjusting headset, etc. found that i prefer a physical button), have to choose between Alexa/Siri/google/nc to use an actual button for (qc35ii has Siri built in to the play/pause button and then the extra button can be set to another voice assistant/nc)

If I needed these just for fun and travel these would be my top pick but I need them for work (Web conferences, cell phone calls) and school (studying) mostly. In both of these situations I need to be able to receive notifications from two devices simultaneously ideally or at least be able to switch between two devices easily. Unfortunately neither of these is possible with these headphones. I have to mess around in the Bluetooth settings every time I get to work and am ready to switch from my phone(Iphone) to my pc(surfacebook). Bose can do it no problem but Sony can’t. So I will have to be practical in Bose instead of cool looking in Sony. If aesthetics and sound were all that mattered to me it would be Sony hands down but I’m 30 now and efficiency is more important... please get it together Sony 😩","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sound quality is flat without an equalizer... available via an app from Sony.

It makes unnecessary sounds when it changes conditions (you can turn off the feature, but not the sounds, choose your poison).  I have no idea why the bluetooth sounds good sometimes and at other times sounds like a dollar store headphones.
When you try to use them for a phone call, for some reason, they replay the last sound you heard.  For some other reason, the noise cancelling stops completely.

To make it desk top charge, you need to pull out your laptop, or a portable charger. Very inconvenient. They are great reference being away from your device.

The main selling point, which is noise cancellation does work. I don't know if it's better or worse than other models with active NC but it actually doesn't isolate much better than the HD380. Perhaps it would fare better during flight, I really don't know.

The comfort is decent, not as good as the HD380 but also much better than the ATH-M50x for example.

The sound is well...also decent but average at best. The bass bleeds too much into the mid-range IMHO and the stage is rather narrow - which is surprising because with all the DSP going inside one would think that it's trivial to EQ them to the user's preferences - and one would be wrong because there is no EQ function at all in the companion phone app.

Speaking of the companion app, it's rather pathetic. It's only real use is to upgrade the headphone's firmware and this is a process that takes a ridiculously long time.

Overall they have a decent  but not exceptional sound, won't squeeze your head to death but are not particularly comfortable and they do block ambient noise but not any better than a good set of well isolated standard headphones. They do however have one fatal flaw and this is the choice of material that is used by SONY. It stinks. There is a constant smell of chemicals from the headphones and the case and it makes me nauseous to keep them on my head more than a few minutes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_195?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=195&reviewerType=all_reviews"

In order to switch devices, you have to turn off bluetooth on the currently paired device, turn off the headphones, turn them back on, and manually connect them to the new device. Bose allows you to do this with a switch on the headphones, or by pausing playback on the first device, and playing sound on the second device. Sony needs to include this feature by any means if they want a best-in-class product.

You can take calls from one device and play music from another, but that doesn't solve the multi-device issue.

As someone who switches between a laptop and phone all day, this is a deal-breaker.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They feel fantastic, they're lovely to look at and to control (especially swiping the volume controls and the feel and responsiveness of the connectivity buttons). They're light comfortable, incredibly high quality and they sound awesome. I bought the Bose Quietcomfort 35 II after buying these because I wasn't quite sure given the great Bose reviews - and 300+ bucks is a huge investment - and ended up selling the Bose on eBay immediately. They didn't feel as durable or high quality and the Sony's sounded and felt better. The Bose are really good and I'm sure they'll strike back but these are just in a different league. I've had these mated to the ""Avantree Oasis Plus aptX HD Long Range Bluetooth Transmitter"" for use with my receiver at home and mixer at work and they work great together.

Come on Amazon, I know you-- you're better than that.

I returned the 1000XM2's and purchased the 1000XM3's, paying about a $50 premium in price to upgrade. It was worth it.

Good:
-Excellent noise cancelling, same as 1000XM2's
-Excellent sound signature (tighter and deeper bass than XM2's, the tiniest bit wider sound stage due to larger ear cups)
-Massively improved comfort due to larger ear cups and improved headband. Decreased clamping force. They float!

Bad:
-New touch pad design sucks, and seems a little less accurate than the XM2's. The textured surface from XM2's gave your finger some stopping force. Now when the touch pad doesn't read your input, it's like missing a golf swing as your finger fly's off the pad. Doesn't feel like an update at all. And oils from your fingers show up on this surface much more.
-No multi-device connectivity. Seriously Sony, why?! There were SO FEW criticism's of the XM2's. Still can't believe they missed that opportunity.
-There seems to be more sound leak compared to XM2's? It's hard to tell if it's worse ANC or a worse enclosure, but there is fan in my elevator that I can now hear that I didn't with the XM2's. Could be that the XM2's were letting in another frequency that helped mask it from my attention, but it's hard to say. Still incredible noise cancelling.

Conclusion: More of a (necessary) facelift to the XM2's than a new generation of the 1000X's. Is it worth it? Heck yeah.

If you use these at work: The peace of mind from the battery life, comfort, and ambient noise features is invaluable. You just don't have to think about these headphones during your day, and that goes a long way.

If you're an audiophile, these sound way better than the Bose QC35 II's. Coming from my beloved Vmoda crossfades with the 50mm drivers and super wide sound stage, I still find these capable and enjoyable.

If you're a gamer, these pair up PERFECTLY with Vmoda's boompro microphone (hooks up to PS4 controller). This was a big deciding factor for me. Having a pair of headphones that can do anything is awesome (and gaming with noise cancellation is awesome if you play games where you need to hear footsteps). Included a photo with the mic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product-reviews/B07G4MNFS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_194?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=194&reviewerType=all_reviews"
