I don't think the order you do those is going to hurt your cause any further than this injurious book has, and that is -- should be -- as sad as it is scary.

As the neurotypical parent to two autistic children, I heard about this book from rightfully outraged members of the autistic community online and then decided to read it on behalf of the ones who had yet to so that they would not have to. Although I share the opinion that the title was in extremely poor taste, having loved ones who have bravely fought against cancer, I wanted to give the book a ""fair shot"" as it were, reading it in its entirety before I reviewed it here. And what I found was that the contents of the book were actually worse than the title. However, that isn't commendable in its effort.

To address the technical concerns that I have with the book, I found that it jumped tenses a lot. Several chapters were written in the present tense, but some were written in the past tense, and the transition between tenses was not in the most predictable manner. Reading was not smooth for me. The manner of Alan's writing would have better fit a seventh grader.

Although Alan states in the preface of the book that he considers his children to be his greatest gifts and encourages him not to give up, the chapters that follow -- all of them -- indicate that he already has, and that he is fighting a losing battle against his children's differing neurologies. He wants so desperately for his children to be ""normal"", for the autism to ""loosen its grip on his children"" that he seems oblivious to the fact that he has two beautiful, worthwhile children right in front of him. They just happen to be autistic. Alan has clearly drunk the Autism Speaks ""kool-aid"", believing that autism has stolen and locked away these seemingly previously normal children. In doing so, he and his wife employ questionable ""treatments"": chelation and detoxification supplements used to flush heavy metals out of bodies, erroneously believing that their children's autism was caused by their buildup, special creams and even hyperbaric oxygen treatments. None of these treatments (hence my putting quotations around the word the first time I used it) have ever been proven to help autistic individuals out, but they are the ones that seem to be clung to by those who want to ""cure"" their child(ren).

Neurological differences, even substantial ones, can not be ""cured"". They can, however, be aided and assisted with therapy that targets a deficit in an important life skill (such as speaking). They should, and should not, be used to try to make a child that is acting ""different"" in a harmless manner (flapping, for instance) act less so because they desperately want the child to be ""normal"". If the child is stimming or moving in a manner that does not hurt them or those around them, why should the neurotypical as a whole be allowed to judge that child's coping mechanisms on the basis that they are ""weird""?

My ideology has always been that if you claim to want to help those who are autistic, and you anger or sadden those who are actually autistic in your words and your actions, you are not doing what you claim you want to do. This book just reeks of Alan's desperation to have normal children to the point where he can't be happy with the two children he has right in front of him, and I fear for the day either one of his children might pick up his book themselves and start to read it.

Love your children unconditionally for who they are rather than expecting the impossible of them. Accept their differences.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Uh-huh.","December 2, 2015","I'm autistic. I was only diagnosed as an adult because despite my severe social struggles, I was fully verbal and very academically gifted. Sure, life was more difficult sometimes, but I like who I am now. Being autistic isn't the end of the world. We're each fully unique individuals with talents and emotions and the ability to enjoy life as much as anybody else.

I'm a published author, an Army veteran, and a happily married man with an amazing wife. I have friends, a job, and multiple college degrees. I have hobbies and a social life that is perfectly suited to me. I attend conventions, speak in front of huge crowds, and enjoy costume competitions. I've performed in musicals, sung barbershop, and love karaoke. Sure, I still get overstimulated sometimes. When I was younger, I had no clue how to socialize (even though I desperately wanted to, and longed to be accepted) and had severe anxiety and depression because I felt so alone. I used to have outbursts. However, I don't anymore. I got the help I needed. I found the most amazing woman in the world who has been with me for almost nine years, and has helped me to become the man I am today. I have friends who understand me. I'm happy and functional with a full, rich life.

We all know how it feels when someone scolds us.  I did have to pipe in on this.
Everyone has their cross to bare in life.  Luckily for most, cancer is not one of them.  For the unlucky few it is and because of ""WHEN"" our child developed Leukemia/started treatment (age 23 months) he has now been diagnosed with autism.  He also was treated for PTSD.
All I want you to know is dealing with the Autism is nothing compared to dealing with the cancer.  To watch your child being given chemicals that might kill them and makes them very ill and causes incredible pain is not fun, enjoyable etc. For almost four years our child endured chemo not to mention all of the deadly infections that we did not know if he would live through. Secondary cancers are probable, as well as recurrence of the original cancer.  We as parents of REAL CHILDREN with cancer have to deal with all of not so important things such as loss limbs, eyes, ability to walk, brain damage, autism and the psychological damage etc that the cancer treatment has done to our children. You are given the perception that 80% of children are cured. When I asked if our child was cured our doctor said ""When he is married with children and in his thirties I will consider your child cured"".  Everyday we wait for the beast to return and ravage our child. With Autism life goes on.....
As my husband has said with all of his military honors/medals. ""Cancer has brought me to my knees"".  Autism has not.

I have met and know so many families who have lost a beautiful soul to the ravages of cancer, so many wonderful families shattered by the diagnosis.  I also know lots of families with beautiful children with autism who adapt and cope with the many challenges that diagnosis brings them.

I'm wondering how the parents of children with autism would repond to a book by a parent who lost their child to cancer, ""I Wish My Child Had Had Autism.""  Does this author realize that some children with brain tumors or those who receive cranial radiation for leukemia sometimes have severe neurological life long effects, even traumatic brain injury?

Did he not stop to think how he'd react if he discovered that his Father had wished a potentially fatal illness on him? Or has he come to class people on the autistic spectrum as so strongly 'other' that he failed to even realise they could be affected by this? And then there's people who've dealt with cancer! Surely he sees how horrific this title could seem to them? How it could trivialise something they know to be serious? In fact, did he consider anyone at all when writing his sensationlist headline, or was he only concerned about provoking as much sympathy as possible?

And the sad thing is, I reckon he'd still insist that it's autistic people who lack empathy...","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wish-Kids-Had-Cancer-Surviving/product-reviews/1606720708/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When I saw this title I thought it was a sarcastic Facebook meme poking fun at parents who catastrophise.

To find its real is just too much. Reading some of the reviews here I can see I am not the only one.

I work with people who have cancer. To wish that on your own child says do much about who you are and how much you understand about the world. None of it good!

I also have autism. Believe me autism is NOT worse than cancer.

The title of this book is inflammatory, offensive, ablist, outrageous and heartbreaking.

It doesn't matter what's in it (though there is no 'look inside' to give us a clue)

I'm all for freedom of speech and publishing rights and all but this is a book I would gladly see pulled from the public eye. It ought to be a crime to portray a human condition so many live with as worse than cancer.

Out of fairness, I will not give this book one star because I haven't read it yet.  Although I doubt I have the time to read it.  But, I will just say that I understand how devastating it is to feel that you are losing your sweet three year old to autism.  But it really angers me to read this title, because you do not wish your child had cancer.  You wish you would get the sympathy that parents of children with cancer get.  It is little consolation and doesn't last very long.  Even though there has been significant advancements in cures for various childhood cancers, the treatment for cancer is torturous and almost as harmful as cancer itself. Even if my daughter survives into adulthood, she has a great chance of developing other cancers or diseases during her life.  You can't imagine how cancer treatment affects a young child with autism.  She has lost so much developmental ground since getting sick.  You really can't compare the two issues.  One is a neurological disorder and one might not kill your child if all goes well.  There are so many good interventions and therapies now for our children with autism, there is hope now.  I understand your feelings, but using this title just makes you sound selfish.  I hope with all my heart that your children don't get cancer, but I do wish you would change this title.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wish-Kids-Had-Cancer-Surviving/product-reviews/1606720708/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It felt like having a comrade in this crazy journey through the spectrum.  His story is compelling and shows the courage and strength of he and his wife dealing with two children on the spectrum.  It shows you that ""you are not alone"" and also challenges parents to stand up and fight for their children's rights in the school system, in regards to care, insurance companies and overall just advocating for your children's rights.  The ""cancer"" reference may offend some but if you read this book, you understand where the author is coming from and as a mother of a child on the spectrum, I understand.  I truly believe that insurance companies and government entities are covering up a lot in regards to the causes of autism for fear of a mass lawsuit - this pertains to vaccinations as well as other potential causes (amalgam fillings, rhoGam shots, environmental items such as household cleaners, pesticides,etc.) We may never know the cause and correct treatments but we'll die trying to find out - thank you Michael for your book - you are a true hero to your children - keep up the good work with your lovely wife!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Wish-Kids-Had-Cancer-Surviving/product-reviews/1606720708/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My friend has many times she's glad her son has autism and not Histiocytosis, because she doesn't think she could deal with all this. I always tell her I'd rather keep what I've got and admire her ability to take care of her son. We each have a different type of ""patience"".

Don't ever wish your loved one has this or that instead.

Before Histiocytosis was finally labeled a cancer, people would say ""at least it's not cancer"" when hearing of someone's diagnosis with this disease. Makes my blood boil. Here's what cancer (that's not cancer) has done to my son:

ARM represents that Autism is a part of the human being that cannot be taken away from us. After all, Autism affects everything from my 5 senses to my interests and social life.

This book acts as if all Autism is extremely severe and overly negative. Autism is positive, negative, and neutral. For example, I cannot understand human body language very well but I have a deep understanding of animal body language that comes naturally to me as an expression of my Autistic traits. Note that not understanding people's body language is not a negative to me. Why? Because I tell people that I am different and we work together to understand one another! No need to fix what isn't broken.

As for a negative, I suffer from autistic self injury and definitely from other people's bigotry. Autistic Self Injury is a huge problem that communities affected by autism deal with and I do sincerely hope that one day there will be an effective treatment so that I no longer self injure. At the same time I don't at all wish to be cured of my autism because that would mean erasing me as a human being and replacing me with somebody else. Bigotry is my biggest enemy. People have told me that I should not be allowed to breed, that I should not marry, that I do not have a soul, that I an essentially an animal, and don't even get me started on Autism Speaks! Terrible. Excuse. For. An. Organization.

End inhumane treatment of all Autistic People! Viva la Autism Rights!

PS: I have worked with severely affected autistics persons and many high functioning autistics. All those capable of communicating agreed with me on Autism being a part of them. To those who are very negatively affected, let a less ignorant society work towards things that ACTUALLY improve your lives such as speech therapy and Floor-time instead of chelation and electric shock treatments. Do you know there have been children who were killed by their parents because they have Autism? It needs to end!

Those kids go thru so much more than anything you ever have to deal with. My son has relapsed and is on the last chance chemo. Because his AUTISM prevents him to be able to handle more intense treatment. There is a good chance that chemo is starting to fail right now and we have to wait a few more weeks before his scan to see if we have to plan for his funeral.

I am autistic, with a mother currently undergoing treatment for endometrial cancer. This book is tone deaf at best, utterly hateful at worst. This author has some nerve, exploitatively manipulating the pain that the families of cancer patients go through to cast aspersions on a minority population who deserve none of it. Autistics deserve dignity, autonomy, and respect - not this shaming, ableist, repulsive drivel.

I hope these children are taken away from this ""father"" and put in a home that appreciates and loves them.
