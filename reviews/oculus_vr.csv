This is a game changer for VR. I remember when Oculus first appeared the cost of entry was pretty high ($1500 computer + $600 VR headset). Now you can have a great mobile VR headset for a fraction of the price. Yes this is still a pretty expensive gadget (at $399) but the barriers for entry for high quality VR has never been lower. Sure PSVR is cheaper but you still need a PS4 to run the whole thing. Oculus Quest is pretty much a stand alone device once the initial setup is done (yes you need a smartphone for the initial setup but once it is done you don't need your smartphone anymore as everything is self contained even the VR app store). This is the perfect device to introduce your friends and family to VR. This device is almost perfect but it does have some flaws: the number flaw is the power drain. Fully charged it will last you about 2-3 hours but in practice the device will be drained in about 2.5 hours, even if you connect it to a 20,000 mAH power bank it drains power faster than it charges so at most it will last you about 3.5 hours before you have to stop to recharge (anyway you should probably be taking a break by that time -- using VR excessively can be disorienting and exhausting). Also it gets a bit warm if you are charging it while actively using it. Yes there is light leak at the bottom edge of the headset (near the nose). I think it is intended but if that bothers you, there are a third party solution (third party face attachment) that fully blocks out light at the bottom edge of the headset (near the nose). I would say Oculus almost got it perfect and I think the next iteration of the the device will solve many problems.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

You need to create a boundary system pretty much every time. But it takes only seconds. As opposed to previously, where you had to go into the settings, and walk around the room with the controller. Robo Recall supports cross buy. I would recommend it if you don't have it. It runs extremely smooth. I tested shooting behind my back and out of my field of view. It picked up everything. The library is weak as of today. But that's just because they're trying to sell you old games at full price. Job simulator? $30 really? Where's my vacation simulator!? Games are expensive on here. But it's not like the Oculus Go. It's more like the PSVR running on a regular PS4. I own every headset that's ever come out. Even the virtual Boy. This thing is definitely worth it. I dropped it 1 star because of the overpriced library, even for people that have owned these games for 2+years. Once the library picks up It will be amazing.
Update: I used my Bionik headphones that I had for my PSVR on it. See pic. They're a tight fit, but work great. And they're super comfy.
Update: If you are in the fence I recommend waiting if you can. It's been over a month and there is NOTHING in the store. I play beat saber mostly now because it's getting boring. No new games, no announcements. I know they're just trying to hold out so people will re buy 3 year old games at full price. Once the library picks up however, I may get rid of my rift","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Everything you need to get going is in the box. You don't have to worry about hooking it up to a PC or setting up tracking stations. You just slap it on and go.

In my opinion, this is the VR that the market has been waiting for. It has the full room scale freedom and fully articulated controllers of a PC based headset with the wireless freedom and ease of use that you get with systems like the Oculus Go or Samsung Gear VR.

Speaking as someone who owns (for now) the HTC Vive, the Quest is incredible. The drawbacks of running on a mobile processor instead of a gaming PC are a small price to pay for the ease of use and portability.

If you've been waiting to jump in or just find yourself letting your wired headset sit and collect dust, consider the Quest.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Casting to the phone is a great feature but it’s a bummer that it doesn’t support sound casting to phones.

Overall experience is amazing. The portability and cordless is great!

Pros: Lenses are great. Screen door effect feels lesser than the Vive oddly enough.
Tracking is 90% as good as the Vive i'd say. You rarely ever notice it having an issue. Most of the time it depends on how well the game makes use of it.

Cons: Battery life is only 2 to 3 hours (from what i've heard but I haven't used it enough straight to hit it).

The hand and body presence that the Quest gives in the virtual space is mind blowing. The physical build is sturdy and feels well made, the software is intuitive and smooth and gives a sense of ""Wow, how did they do that?"". A big barrier of VR in previous years has been the convoluted and time consuming set up required. The Quest is as easy to use as modern day consoles, just turn it on, wait a few seconds, and you're ready to go. I would say it is a serious competitor to modern day consoles.

The headset is comfortable and I had no issues wearing it for extended periods of time. Sound is good but can be heard by others around you so for privacy headphones are needed. I usually get around 2-3 hours of battery life which I think is great as it allows you to decompress after an active session playing, but if you want to keep going the 10ft charging cable would allow you to do so just fine.

There are tons of games and experiences to go through, some of my favorites being Rec Room, Beat Saber, and Sports Scramble. Note that a lot of the games on the Quest require a decent amount of physical activity so if you aren't in decent shape already, a couple hours of engaging VR will certainly get you there. I will say there isn't as much depth to the current games for my taste. As in many of the games feel more like an arcade than PC or console games. I guess you could say VR still hasn't found its WoW or Fortnite. However, the Quest shows that the hardware is there to support it, so with more time more in depth and long lasting games will almost certainly find their way to the Quest.

Overall I couldn't be happier with the purchase and this feels like a premium product that I would recommend you try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The biggest road block for me was not the price of the headset itself but the price of the powerful gaming PC that I would need to run things. I'd previously managed to find a cheap GeatVR headset for my Samsung S7, and while that was entertaining, it lacked the power and two-handed Touch control system of the full Oculus system. From the moment I saw the Quest concept, I knew it was the way to go and pre-ordered my headset long before they started shipping. I had considered the Oculus Go but to me, it seemed like little more than a convenient GearVR. I went for the 128GB as historically with such things, what seems like overkill on launch day, turns out to be a neccessity a few years down the line.

The 6-degrees of freedom (6DoF) offered by the Quest is absolutely necessary for a fully immersive experience. With no cables to worry about and a reasonably sized play space, you will gets lost in the VR world. Having not been a keen cutting-edge gamer for many years, the reduction of graphical quality betwen this and PC based systems was negligible to my mind. What is more important is the experience, not photo realistic imagery. The twin Touch controllers really allow intuative interaction with the virtual world. Some of the early experiences are true showcases for the platform and Robo Recall and Beat Saber really lend themselves to this platform. In addition to the gaming aspect, I often use the Quest to watch Netflix and other online video streams without disturbing the rest of the family. I tend to wake up early and can happily sit in bed watching and browsing until everyone else gets up.

To address some common negative comments... Unlike many, I have rarely found the headset uncomfortable, even during extended play. My 14 yo daughter, who weights around 100lb soaking wet, also has no issue with the weight and balance of the headset. I get 2-3 hours of gameplay out of the battery, which is usually telling me it's time to take a break and I've played seated experiences or watched video while plugged in. I've rarely had any technical glitches of note and struggle to find fault with the Quest. The fact it is often unavailable tells you that the hype is translating into sales that exceeded production and that can only be a good thing as developers see the commercial sense in adapting existing VR titles and creating new ones for Quest.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

(1.5 complaints)","May 25, 2019","I’m having so much fun with this device! One thing that wasn’t apparent on the website is the ability to “cast” or stream whatever is being showed on the headset to a TV which makes it a lot of fun to play with family and friends.

Favorite Game: Star Wars Vader Immortal- is stunning and so much fun. When I first saw Vader I got scared, not kidding I backed up a little when he walked into the room. It’s such an amazing feeling to be apart of the universe. I always saw myself as a smuggler or day dreamed of flying a space ship. The Quest makes it possible! I’m now a loyal customer.

My one and a half complaints/wish list: though the Quest is so much fun and well worth the cost I was a little disappointed by the quality of some of the video. I’m not sure if this is because of the wireless nature of the device or the or the technology hasn’t quiet hit the mark of my 4K tv (hehe). That said, it’s still phenomenal and highly recommended. I also wished they could have provided more information about the product and functionality. As I mentioned above, I didn’t know you could “Cast” (see what the user sees) to a TV without digging around on YouTube and google reviews. I also struggled to find information about the headphones. The functionality information is not that big a deal for me and you can easily find tutorials on YouTube.

I’m now curious as to the experience and video resolution of the other Oculus devices. I’m truly enjoying this purchase and the partnership with Star Wars (more please). I’m a very very casual gamer and can’t help but wonder if the video experience would improve if I purchase another of the devices. If you’re curious if it’s still worth it.... it is! I would have paid $1000 for this and personally surprised how fair the pricing is. Way to go Oculus! Can’t wait to see what is next. The future of gaming and entertainment is here. I can’t help but think of movies like Ready Player One, Surrogates, and The Gamer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When it said the update was complete, I went to check things out but the system would no longer work. The display would only stay on for a few seconds showing three dots. It seems something didn’t go correctly with the update. I tried a factory reset. The display worked fine again at the initial setup mode, but again would no longer work after the setup/update and restart.

I contacted Oculus through their email only support. They told me on May 24 I would be emailed a shipping label in 1-3 business days to return my unit and would get a replacement about 10-12 business days after returning it. I never received the shipping label in my email. I tried updating the ticket on May 30, but it had been closed due to inactivity and a new ticket was created. I’ve only gotten cursory responses like “we are looking into your issue” on this new ticket. It’s now June 4 and no update has been made to the ticket in 34 hours. I’m giving up on this and going to return my Quest to Amazon for a refund.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The graphics aren't high end but they are actually pretty good, especially happy about the mechanical ipd. My main gripe is the tracking. Is it horrible, no. Is it noticeable enough that I have started to change how I stand or hold my hands in VR, yes and that is at best immersion breaking and at worst makes some games frustrating to play. One and done beat saber maps are a no go even on normal as at some point in a map, tracking will cost me a miss. Natural pitching or batting motions get lost if hands are held too far back for more than a second or two. Aiming with pistols is noticeably inaccurate compared to OG rift although not as bad as the rift S it seems. So glad I didn't buy one of those. Also not great but better than rift s is the sound, which is substandard compared to OG rift in every way and I much prefer the OG rift audio. It doesn't sound very good, get very loud, or have any bass plus it periodically starts making this vibrating sound almost like a blown speaker and even when not actually sucking you're still bleeding sound into the house so it practically requires headphones to be used with it and since it doesn't support Bluetooth headphones that means a wire you know for the wireless headset.

Also it's heavy. Most people struggle with wearing it for more than an hour and some can't take it after half that and everyone is constantly adjusting it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Oculus Quest is a great leap forward and I would 100% recommend this headset to anyone looking to get into VR, you most likely also will only need the 64gb unless you plan on storing moves and such.

My biggest issue with this headset would be it's significantly heavier then the Oculus Go and Oculus Rift, the Oculus Go felt as close to wearing nothing as possible, its way more comfortable then the Quest, to the point I forget I'm wearing it sometimes. With the Quest  I am constantly reminded it is on my face, to the point I just have to take it off after 20 minutes or so because it is uncomfortable. It is a very odd problem, because when I hold both of them in my hands the weight doesn't seem that significant, but when I'm wearing the product it is 100% apparent. This being said if you have had little to no experience with the Go or Rift this most likely isn't going to be a big issue.

Other than this it is great, the games are amazing, tracking is awesome and being wireless is phenomenal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

You have to enable developer options to turn off the guardian system so you can use this lieing down or in the dark which is inconvenient.

My main problem is I bought some content ($50-$100) for the Go and while Oculus/Facebook say the content will transfer (and list the title I bought, for example Wander and Ultrawings) this doesn't actually work. There is a page on the oculus website showing the titles that transfer and some people are getting their titles transferred but others are not. If it doesn't ""just work"" you're out of luck, Oculus/Facebook support says ""just keep checking back"" -- but the 'offer' expires at the end of the year so I'm guessing they're trying to get people to just give up and re-buy their content.

Here is the page that describes the policy -- however the chat session I just had indicates this is not their actual policy -- games listed as 'eligible for upgrade' are not for at least my account.

The Oculus support person said I could always return it, and after dealing with them for an hour I think I will. Next stop Amazon customer support. I'll buy it again once they have the store and software working like they describe on their own website.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It is fun. I mean, a LOT of fun. The touch controllers are pretty intuitive. Even me (who doesn't play a lot of games) can do it without a ton of instructions from my kids. My son plays a ton of games and he is even better at it. We did see that a lot of people are having technical issues with it, such as battery charging issues. Ours is a little finicky to get to charge when the battery is really low, but it does charge. We only had that problem once, so maybe it was because the batteries were at zero.

Overall, it is indeed awesome, but it almost feels like the whole system itself isn't quite finished. The headset is great (if you don't have any difficulties), but there are difficulties. It is hard to share screen shots and videos with friends or the casting to tv. We play this as a family most times, not alone, so we need it to cast. I mean, what are the other people going to do while one person is wearing the headset. We only have one headset, so we haven't tried interacting with them...yet! Our favorite games so far are Job Simulator, Beat Saber, VR Chat and Moss. We have only had it a few days now and I am sure as the platform expands and we explore more, we will find other favorites.

For casting, we did get it to work by sort of tricking it. We cast from the quest to our phone, then on the phone, we cancelled the cast, but requested cast on the tv. That seemed to work. There were occasional stutters or freezes, but it was minimal.  We have both a televition with ChromeCast built in and a dongle. The casting would not work at all with the built in ChromeCast, but did (with the phone method) using the little ChromeCast dongle thing.

 The VR itself is amazing including the touch controllers. The overall experience of playing VR games is great and it i very fluid and comfortable. You actually believe you are in the VR world, but the overall user experience is still a little rough around the edges. However, it shoudn't be an issue within a few months with updates.  It isn't cheap. My kids pooled their money from birthdays and graduation to help get it and I was hoping they didn't make a mistake. So far I think they made a great choice!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Seems to be a known issue with the charger or batteries.  Sadly it happened right after I bought 2 new games, which I've never gotten to play.  This was a bummer, but stuff does break...that's life.  Far worse than it breaking is the complete lack of support, contact info, and follow up they offer.  Basically it's NOTHING!  I've worked in the consumer electronics field for 30+ years and have dealt with hundreds of manufacturers...some great, some just good, and some terrible.  But I've never even remotely had an experience this bad.  They literally have no phone number, only offer a 'ticket based' online portal, and when you reply to their 'support suggestions' they never respond.  It's really unbelievable.

Being able to see your hands ingame has been wonderful, the tracking is spot on, the guardian system is so so good. I love playing beat saber and rec room/vr chat.

The only complaint I have right now is the left springy side to headband doesn't work at all. Probably a manufacturer defect. It still works just by tightening the strap but definitely an annoyance. Tempted to try and exchange it but I really don't want to be without this for that long.

Downloaded the Oculus app on my phone and followed directions. all purchases can be done through the phone app and automatically install on the device.  Most games average 200mb to 3Gigs per install.

Having owned Rift previously I can say for certain that this was a much smoother experience to get going. Enjoyment level was also higher because of no cables to constantly remind you that you are attached to something.  Battery life seemed decent 3-5 hours on full charge depending on games played, charging time is pretty fast as well under 2 hours to full charge.  Nausea level was also significantly lower to non existent. This may vary per user of course.

You are free to move anyway and anywhere you like. The new Guardian Safety zone feature is way better than the Rift. The headset is somewhat heavier than the others but that's expected do to the cameras and hardware to support it. I do not like the solid rubber headset straps but the built in speaker system works great. Headphones are even better. Im not happy with the Beta ""Casting"" feature to Chromecast yet. They need to fix that. (it doesn't always work). The games are limited but new ones are being added weekly and ome of them are cross platform so if you own it for the Rift it cam be downloaded for free for the Quest ( and vice versa). Battery life is not as long as I like but you can get an external power block cheap enough to extend play.
The Graphics are great for the games they have so far. The controllers seem to use more battery than the Rift ( had to replace mine after about 4 hrs of use but that was playing games (Boxing) that require constant use of the controller. Im sure if you were just watching videos or exploring other worlds they would last longer. I switched to rechargable ""A"" batteries for the controllers.
It needs a case to protect it and you need to keep some lens cleaners around (lens gets dirty fast). I am a VR person from the start  and overall I love this headset and look forward to more title releases and Hardware upgrades to give the Quest a near perfect score. I give it a 9 out of 10 due to the headstraps ( which I dislike alot).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Oculus Quest bridges that gap perfectly. It is fully immersive with quality visuals and Touch controllers with amazing portability. Pull it out, turn it on, draw your guardian boundary, and your are playing in seconds, anywhere you take it. No cords to trip on.

I pre-ordered a Rift & a Vive.  I own a Oculus Go, PSVR, Odyssey, & Odyssey + as well as every Gear VR & Daydream View that's been released.  The Quest is what mainstream VR looks like.  The freedom that wireless brings and the difference in the experience can't be overstated.  I won't be buying another PCVR headset until wireless is built-in.

Make no mistake, this is a mobile device, however the comments about ""PS2"" graphics and such are idiotic.  It's not difficult to find side-by-side comparison photos/videos versus the PCVR equivalents and while there are obviously differences it's remarkable what developers are doing with this hardware.  For most games the difference is hardly noticeable once you're actually playing  I'm not going to spend a lot of time on that because it's easy enough to find videos on Youtube.  The optics themselves are fine.  I hate Fresnel lenses but this is maybe the least annoying pair I've used so far.  The screens are great with deep blacks and vibrant colors.  There is more SDE than the Go but it's not bad at all IMO.  The image quality overall I would say is excellent.

It's very comfortable for me.  Obviously this is going to vary depending on the shape of your face and head but I have no problems even for extended periods of time.  It is heavier than PCVR headsets of course, and a little heavier than the Go, but it is hardly noticeable.  The headband cradles the base of the skull in a way that keeps most of the pressure on my forehead instead of my cheeks so it doesn't bother me.  As a person with a massive head I'm very happy that it has the software IPD adjustment.  Fogging has been a non-issue but it does have a super-absorbent foam surround.  I really wish the headset manufacturers would starting including leather/rubber/whatever facial interfaces in the box that can be easily wiped off and cleaned of sweat.  It's especially important for something like this that you may be passing around.

The sound is good but not great.  It sounds good but it's not quite loud enough.  It's plenty loud if your'e alone in a quiet room but if there are others around talking or if there is background noise it can be insufficient.  I'm happy to have the audio solution it does have though since it allows me to keep some awareness of my surroundings.  I just wish it got louder.  I can always plug in headphones if I want better sound.

You can cast from the Quest to your phone and from your phone to a Chromecast.  This works fairly well though there is a delay.  This can get really distracting when you're in the headset because you're hearing the sound duplicated about a 1/2 second or so later.  Headphones could alleviate this.  It does seem to be a needlessly complicated procedure.  I don't get why Oculus places so much reliance on this stupid phone app.  You have to have it to activate the Quest just like you did with the Go.  This really seems like a stupid process and I hope they get rid of it sooner than later.  The app does make it nice and easy to manage my library and browse the store but it should be optional.  Unfortunately not all apps can be cast.  The biggest and most noticeable example is Beat Saber.  This is arguably the premier VR experience right now and the best way to show off the Quest.  Not having streaming available seems like an insane oversight to me.  The devs have stated that they are working on that so hopefully it will be available sooner rather than later.

Tracking works very well.  I've played mostly Beat Saber but also Vader Immortal, I Expect You To Die, Journey of the Gods, the tutorial, and some Space Pirate Trainer.  The Odyssey+ is my favorite PCVR headset but the WMR tracking is not the best.  This is far, far better.  It's very noticeable in Space Pirate Trainer.  I would frequently lose tracking on my Odyssey & Odyssey + on my shield hand but no such issues with the Quest.  The only time I've noticed any issues at all is when it gets too close to the headset between the cameras.  I did see some video of a guy having issues throwing grenades in Onward but given I don't play Onward and I've thrown things with no problem in multiple other games with the Quest I expect this is something to do with the specific game.  One thing to be aware of -- the tracking requires light to work.  IT DOES NOT WORK IN A DARK ROOM.  Apparently it does work in the dark if you flood the room with IR light but I'm guessing most people won't just have IR light emitters lying around.

The Quest has by far the easiest setup and best Guardian system I've seen.  Put the headset on.  If the floor isn't at the right height just touch the floor and you're good.  Now you get a cursor from your controller to draw a circle/square on the floor and you're set.  Takes like 15 seconds max.  This is how it should be.  MUCH better than walking around your room with a headset or controller, sitting your headset on the floor, etc.  You can easily switch between a Roomscale Guardian and Standing Only Guardian (small circle around you) with just a few button presses.  If you're really feeling lucky you can even go into developer options and disable it all-together.  It's also super cool how if you stick your head through the Guardian wall you get a 3D view from the cameras.  It's black and white and something is definitely off about it but it's still super cool.  It's kind of like the Vive pass-through but more useful.  Now if only you could activate it at will.  Also worth noting that the Guardian boundaries are a little more sensitive than I'd like.  I wish they didn't pop up until my hand/head was right on top of it.  They do appear more often than I'd like.

Okay a bit long winded but I hope I didn't miss anything.  This is easily my favorite headset.  No need to mess around with Steam VR, no cables, just put it on and play.  This is the future of VR I think and I really understand now why Carmack has been so into mobile VR from the beginning.  While enthusiasts like myself, and probably a lot of you reading this review, will always be out there enjoying better graphics and cutting edge experiences that is not where the masses will play.  Just like your average gamer is on a mobile phone or a console and not a gaming PC.  That's what the Quest is; a VR console.  Everyone I've shown it to has been far more excited by this than they ever were for the PCVR headsets.  The launch lineup is great, even if individual games can be a bit pricey, so hopefully enough people get to try it and fall in love that it takes off.  That may or not happen with this version 1.0 of the Quest but I'm 100% convinced that this is the form-factor that will rule in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The guardian system is cool and I DID NOT GET ANY MOTION SICKNESS with the 6 degrees of freedom (6DOF) that comes with this front-facing cameras guardian system.  However, it's probably related to programs that took advantage of the 6DOF.
Vadar Immortal would best summarize as YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE THERE!  It's only episode 1 but it's just incredible!.
All the games I tried were interesting and fun.  It's much bigger then what you see in the pictures.  The pictures just show the frontal view.  You feel the presence and the movie theater screen looks like iMax.  Network videos and pictures ran well.  3D videos also work.  Some of the games involve significant physical effort.

Cons:
The headset is front heavy.  You really feel the weight when watching videos but not so much when playing games.
Facebook/Oculus should consider making an improved version of ""Oculus Quest Standard Facial Interface"" as an aftermarket optional accessory to help dissipate the weight of the headset especially at the areas underneath the eyes.  That'll drastically improve the user experience.
Screen door effect is noticeable during video watching.
Video quality is not that sharp especially in slow gaming environments when you start focusing on the details.

Summary:
Incredible technology with tremendous fun factor!  The feeling of presence and lack of motion sickness with programs that take advantage of the 6DOF are amazing!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Quest is the exact opposite. I plop it on my head, quickly draw out a play area with the controller, and I'm good to go. That, plus the freedom of not having to worry about a tether, is well worth the sacrifice of a little bit of visual complexity. At the end of the day, gameplay matters more to me than graphics, and the convenience factor of the Quest significantly improves the gameplay experience.

Comfort isn't perfect, with the Quest exerting more pressure on my cheeks than I would like. I suspect a VR cover might help.  Adding an external battery as a counterweight (I used the Anker battery designed for the Switch and attached it to the back of the strap with Velcro) did help significantly. It's also worth it to make certain you have the strap placed properly on your head (lower than is intuitive for most folks). Having someone hold the headset in place while you get it ""just right"" can help hear. The glasses insert works great, and it's a relief not having to pop in my contacts every time I want to play.

Keep in mind that the Quest does not have integrated headphones, something the people around you will realize immediately. I found over-the-ear cans the most comfortable solution, but Oculus also makes pricey, proprietary earbuds if you prefer.

There are already plenty of titles to keep you occupied at launch, with Beat Saber being the obvious crowd favorite for novice and experienced gamers alike. Vader Immortal, while short, is a breathtaking immersion into the Star Wars universe, and a must-buy for fans of the series.

I think the Quest represents the future of virtual reality. It's a standalone device that is accessible to players of any age. It performs well and intuitively, without many hiccups, and already has a number of title behind it. I'm certain that, as with any tech, the second generation will be even flashier, but there's really no reason to wait. There's plenty of fun to be had right now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, I have had such a horrible experience with Amazon getting one that I feel the stars also reflect me getting one from them.  First the get it in two days if you order within xxx times is a lie.  When I called to see where it was, they REordered it.. I didnt ask for that. Then the second order took over 2 weeks.  when it was supposed to arrive i got a notification on the day it was to be delivered that it was damaged in transit. Amazon DID NOT resend another one. instead I called in to see where it was.. they in turn basically said.. oopps we'll order you another one.. only that one was labeled a replacement.. I NEVER EVEN GOT THE FIRST ONE. this has caused me nothing but headaches.  I FINALLY got it. worked great for roughly 3 weeks then it started over heating and getting aritfacts and finally crashing after an hour and a half of playing. Not even a full battery cycle.  I had to limit my already limited playing time.  THEN the charger cable died.  just the cable. After calling in for a replacement, THAT WAS AN ORDEAL, they said my new one would arrive in Aug..ITS JUNE.. Im in the process of returning this. If I had to say whether the Oculus is good, all I can say is that while it is working it is fun. it still has bad screen door effect. the lag on some games is frustrating, however some games are really fun.  Mostly disappointed with Amazon right now. Hoping to get a GOOD working one...at some point.. when?

I purchased this headset mainly for workout type games like Beat Saber and Box VR. Being wireless is a big advantage for these types of titles and since they are not very graphic demanding they are a good match for the hardware.
I was pleasantly surprised at graphic capabilities of the hardware. Titles like Robo Recall look almost identical to the PC version and play very smoothly. Vadar Immortal looks really good for a 'portable' title and really shows what the hardware is capable of.
Unfortunately the sound quality is very underwhelming with the built in speakers. With my Bose QC headphones it is great. The sound is loud and clear and the 3D sound field is convincing. But with the built in speakers it sounds like everything is coming from a phone strapped to the headset. Definitely the worst out-of-the-box sound of the four headsets I've bought.
Another huge issue with this headset is comfort. When you compare it to other headsets in your hand it doesn't feel much heavier. But when you put it on you sure feel it. This was a real big problem for me. I couldn't make this thing comfortable with any adjustment. Within minutes I would get sore spots on either side of my forehead and for some reason the muscles across the back of my head would get really tight. Something to do with the weight imbalance. No matter how I adjusted the strap I could never get it to support any of the headset weight. To me it just seemed like the strap was designed for a much larger head than mine. I ended up buying a Vive deluxe audio strap and a VR Cover replacement face pad. Between the two they greatly improve the comfort. I'll still never be able to run the battery down without taking a break but I can play for over an hour before I feel like I need to take it off. With the stock strap I was lucky to get 15 minutes before my face and head needed a rest. Also the VR Cover face pad is made from PU leather so it's easy to wipe dry. The stock face pad is a foam material and unfortunately sucks up sweat like the sponge it is. I highly recommend the deluxe audio strap as an upgrade as it greatly improves the comfort and the built in headphones address the awful sound from the stock speakers.
As I mentioned I bought this mainly for workout titles like Beat Saber. Unfortunately I was a bit let down here. I don't consider myself a Beat Saber god and don't take it too seriously but I still like my equipment to keep up with me and not hold me back. But the Quest does hold me back. I generally play on the expert or expert+ level. Most of the songs I play I've full combo'ed long ago on the Rift. I've had the Quest for about two months now and play Beat Saber almost daily and I've yet to full combo even one song on expert. There are just too many tracking and glitching issues that will keep you from being able to complete a song perfectly. It's mainly tracking issues. Pretty much any song will have combos that are just too fast at the higher levels than the Quest can track. Lesser issues are when the screen goes black for a second or two when the headset looses the boundary. This happens in other title too but it seems more often in Beat Saber. And since the latest Beat Saber update it also suffers for a frame rate stuttering problem that didn't exist before the update. Add all that up and it pretty much amounts to never going to full combo on the Quest. And that's after completely changing your play style to accommodate the inside-out tracking which you absolutely have to do too. With all that said the tracking is actually pretty impressive and for everything but Beat Saber it's perfectly fine. But if you are the least bit competitive in Beat Saber you'll be disappointed when the equipment lets you down all the time.
I still think this headset is the way to go for most people as this is the VR 'console' experience as opposed to the VR 'PC' experience and let's face it, most people are 'console' people who just want to pick it up and play. It also has some nice user friendly features. The ability to setup a play area in seconds is nice and the full 3D passthu cameras are awesome and should be standard on every headset made.
At the moment the titles are somewhat limited but new ones are being released or ported all the time and there are plenty to keep you busy unless you've already played them all on another headset.
I knocked off 1-1/2 starts for the huge comfort issue and another 1/2 star because they touted how Carmack was using Beat Saber to fine tune the tracking and yet it's still not reliable.
I'd still recommend this for people just getting into VR but be prepared to spend another $100+ to make it comfortable. Still way cheaper than a VR capable PC.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Oculus support gave me several hours of run around made ridiculous suggestions like turn it off 3 times and wait until the battery is charged to 100% before it will update.  Clearly they had no technical skills.  And after 15 minutes, they should have just replaced the Quest since it was brand new, but they wouldn't.  I can tolerate receiving a defective product because it happens, but any good company would simply replace it immediately.

Thanks to Amazon, I was able to exchange it for a new one with no hassle, since it was Amazon selling it.  This is the second time now I bought a brand new Oculus that didn’t work.  I had problems with my brand new Oculus Rift as well and went through hours and hours of support.  Then they sent me dirty used controllers to replace my brand new ones and it took over a month.  Not a good customer experience at all.  I don’t know of any other time I’ve purchased something brand new and the company didn’t immediately replace it immediately if it was defective.  Wow.

All that said and two weeks later, I love the Quest.  The new one took 15 minutes to set up.  Has no cord!!!  Turns on in a snap.  Downloads much faster.

V.R. has come a long way from Simulacrum-3/Sensorium to the Oculus Quest. We now have a device that finally provides access to the immersive experiences of other lives, fantasies, and insights into perception.

The tech is phenomenal. The Quest has two sharp OLED screens that have minimal to no noticeable halo/screen-door effect, they've solved screen fogging, surround sound (headphones optional), excellent field of view (reduced with spacer if wearing glasses), four external cameras on the headset provide spot-on tracking and a setup of the play space that is both easy and surreal. All of this tech is joined by software that delivers quality, engaging and fun experiences (50+ a week in, plus a slew of browser VR games - like moon rider - and films with the YouTube channel). The mobility of the headset allows for immersive environments, free movement, and heavy gaming that can be brought with you almost anywhere (though complete darkness or bright sunlight cause some problems with tracking).

There may be detractors, most of whom are likely coming from headsets (or expectations) that are much more expensive and/or which require tethering to a high-end computer. I think this is the leading gadget of the year, if not the start of something bigger, like VR breaking through to the average consumer. The price on the Quest isn't exactly small change, but it is within reach of many more, and as a device designed for mobility, it can potentially introduce many more people to VR.

Battery life is about 2-3 hours. Games are curated, hand-picked and continue to baffle me with their level of immersion. Sideloaded apps like vridge promise to allow PC VR games to stream to the headset, while official apps like Virtual PC already allows for 2D streaming of films, games with giant screens in virtual environments.

There are of course things that can be improved, but I'm still astounded at what is provided. It's an excellent introduction to VR and will provide many hours, days, weeks, years of enjoyment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Oculus Quest is a truly standalone system with 6 degrees of freedom.  It gives you true immersive experience and setup is a no-brainer.  No more clucky wire tangling.  Although the picture quality isn't as good as Vive, it doesn't bother me whatsoever.  Room scale and wireless features with 6DOF is a total game changer.  I would give a 5 star if only if the weight can be proper distribute.  There is too much weight on the headset and your cheekbone or forehead may feel the pressure after 20-30 minutes of playtime.  I kinda hack it by adding a little weight to the back of the headset to counterbalance the weight and it feels so much better.  I have to say PSVR is the most comfortable headset among all the competition.  Oculus definitely heading to the right direction, I really look forward they launch Quest 2 with lighter weight.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Ehrlich","Truly amazing, but far less durable than previous Oculus products","July 17, 2019","Let me first just say, this is an amazing one of a kind product. For those just getting into vr, wondering why you'd by something like this over a cheaper mobile headset, like a Go or Gear VR, the Quest is true 6dof (degrees of freedom) VR, unlike all other currently available mobile headsets which are only 3dof. In 3dof you essentially only have the ability to turn and tilt your head, looking around you. You can't lower your view by kneeling, or get closer to or further from an object using just your bodies natural movement. In 6dof your visual perspective is tracked in a 3D space, and is only limited by the room allowed in your physical environment. You can dodge and duck and lean and crawl all while spinning or walking around. Want to go prone in an fps, just lay down! People who haven't experienced 6dof VR are always blown away at the difference it makes and the possibilities it opens up. Then you have the tracked touch controllers, giving you amazing hand presence! Reaching out and grabbing and manipulating virtual objects is a game changer. Before the Quest, the only way to experience this level of immersion and fluidity was with a powerful PC and and a tethered VR HMD, usually requiring you to set up sensors around your playspace. While PC VR is still the only way to experience the most visually impressive VR titles, the Quest is shockingly capable and as a long time PC VR enthusiast I've realized the most immersive experience isn't always the most visually ""advanced"". I've barely used my PC VR (Rift CV1) since getting my Quest.

Overall I think the build quality is pretty good. Not nearly as comfortable or solid as my Rift CV1, but not too far off. I did find it very front heavy, and even after lots of time adjusting it just right, it either hurt my face or the back of my skull after about 30 minutes. I fixed this by attaching a Vive deluxe audio strap, or DAS, and it's now much better, plus is finally has decent audio.

Visually I love the quest. The screens are excellent with amazing blacks since they're oled, and I am not as bothered by the drop from 90hz to 72hz as I thought I'd be. I do notice it though, and super fast paced experiences like high level beat saber do feel a bit more hectic as it's not as smooth. But just barely. However the godrays that I'm used to seeing on gen1 vr like my Rift, and my old vive, are nearly gone on the Quest! It's a huge improvement, due to improved optics.

Now, the tracking isn't perfect, though they vastly improved it on the Rift S with an update, so hopefully Quest will get the same update. With your hands close to the headset, like if you're aiming a rifle, or a bow, tracking breaks pretty quickly, but in general it's very impressive how well the 4 cameras track very fast movements with no problems. However there is an issue with the tracking during very vigorous controller movement, and it's been theorized by many, with a fair amount of testing to support, that under high velocity swings, the battery in the controller will compress the spring and move off the positive contact in the controller, creating a momentary power lapse, and the controller will freeze where it was, or if it was under high acceleration in a single direction may actually look like it's floating off. It only takes a second for the tracking to find the controller and it should reposition to its actual location as long as it has line of sight with the cameras. It does however lead to a lot of frustration in games like beat saber, and has ruined many almost perfect expert+ runs for me. Using a thick silicone tape on the back of the battery so that it can't slide up or down in the compartment has helped this significantly. This seems like it could have been, and some users have, fixed with a stiffer spring. But nothings perfect right.

Well here's my main issue with the Quest, though it applies to the Rift S, since they use identical controllers. The new controllers are really fragile compared to the original rift touch controllers. Those old 1st gen controllers were built like tanks. My walls in my office are missing chunks where I got a bit too aggressive in Gorn. I once punched a 1 liter glass bottle of San peligrino mineral water across the room. During a lively session of Fallout 4 Vr where I didn't tighten the wrist strap, somehow I threw the controller, barely missing my monitor and hitting a wooden door. Other than having to dig out paint and and drywall from the seams on the controller, it basically looks new. And you know what, it's how all VR tracked controllers should be be built! But these new Quest/Rift s touch controllers are not built anywhere near the same standard. Side by side comparisons, and it's obvious they cut corners and material. Yes they're lighter, and compared to many consumer electronics, they seem fine, but for something you're meant to wave around at high speeds while essentially blindfolded, they're not sufficient. Many people have experienced breaks from waist height drops, or even lower in my case. Mine fell off my couch, less than 3 feet, and cracked the tracking ring. And they're $70 to replace each one. This is really disappointing, and I hope they address the build quality in future revisions because I want to feel good giving them all my money.

So in conclusion, despite some seriously frustrating design decisions, I absolutely love it, and recommend the Quest. It's uniquely amazing, but mostly because Oculus currently has a monopoly on untethered mobile 6dof VR. Touch controllers were why I sold my Vive and kept my Rift CV1, and the beating those controllers have endured sold me on Oculus long term, so it's really disappointing to see these new controllers taking a real hit in build quality and durability.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Mudge","Uncomfortable and heavy.  But powerful VR.","May 21, 2019","I bought this because I love to share VR with people.  I was hoping for something that required less set-up, and this is mostly a fit.

But it HURTS my head.  I'm not prone to headaches or nausea - I use the Oculus Rift every day.  But the Quest is too heavy, and doesn't have facial interface meant to handle the weight.  It digs into my cheekbones, and if I tilt it up off my cheekbones, it's got to be strapped so tight that it hurts my forehead.

Pros:
- Powerful and beautiful.  It's got great rendering capability, and a great frame rate.
- Fantastic display.  Minimum screen door effect, no smearing, high resolution.
- Portable. The guardian system is quick to set up, it's tracking from the moment you put it on.
- Headset tracking is flawless, and controller tracking is very good even around the edges.
- Many of my games transferred over!  I got Robo Recall, Tilt Brush, I Expect You To Die and Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes for free, but I will have to re-purchase Beat Saber, Moss and Super Hot.

Cons:
- Heavy.  I'm beyond belief how heavy this thing is, and how ""sharp"" the bottom of the facial interface feels.  I won't be able to play this much.  I'm going to have to acclimate or return it, and I honestly wouldn't bet on either outcome.
- Short battery life.  It'll outlast a LONG game session, but it won't outlast a road trip, so keep your charger handy.  That being said, it's amazing battery life considering what kind of power this thing has.
- Screen sharing isn't very good in quality or reliability, and some games like Beat Saber don't support it.  A wired option would be nice, or a more reliable wireless stream.  I chose this because it's easier to take places and share experiences and ""screen sharing"" was a selling point.  I am disappointed.

Also:
- The audio is good considering it's not over the ear, but it's a disappointment that it is lacking the quality of an over-the-ear option.
- Absolutely TINY game store.  Since the store just opened today, many of the titles are labeled ""Released 2 hours ago,"" so I expect there will be more. The Rift had the same problem, and it quickly improved.","3.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Overall experience I would say this wins hands down. It doesn't have the graphic fidelity of PC games such as Elite Dangerous, but it does VR games very well. The wireless experience is a game changer. Most games I enjoy anyway in VR are simple arcade type games, wingsuit flying, rollercoaster, Job Simulator silliness. Other games like Vader, ping pong and arcade shoot em ups are great fun too. The wireless experience lets you enjoy VR even when you're short on time, something that was hard to do with PC setups like the Vive. Being able to put on the headset and play beat saber for 5 minutes before doing other chores is a great way to relax. Definitely get the travel case to maximise its portability.

VR ready for the masses.","May 21, 2019","The Oculus Quest is amazing. It has blown me away with its ease of use and attention to detail. This is pretty much the toy I have dreamed of since the rudimentary VR arcade games of the late 1980s. My one minor complaint is that the comfort level is merely satisfactory... I wish it was smaller and lighter, but this is a predictable concern when strapping a powerful game console to your face.

SETUP: Within 10 minutes of opening the box, I was walking around inside a virtual world, adapting to my virtual hands by throwing VR paper airplanes and stacking VR blocks. Setup was incredibly quick and easy: download the phone app, put on the Quest, then use a controller to laser-draw a line around the edge of your open play area. All done.

PLAY SPACE: Once you define your open play zone, you can walk around inside it safely while wearing Quest. If you approach the edge of the safe zone, the boundary becomes visible as a giant net in space, much like the walls of a Star Trek holodeck. If you reach or step through the boundary/net, there is a cool warning effect and your hand turns red. If you do not quickly return to the safe area, the VR world disappears and is replaced by a live camera view of your real environment. I can not say enough good things about this process/interface: simple, effective, seamless, robust, fun...SUPERB!

Oculus recommends an open play space 6.5ft x 6.5ft, just enough to duck and dodge and hide behind cover. With a larger space, you will see the border/net less often. 10x10ft is plenty; I have never wanted to dive on the ground or anything.

COMFORT: Quest is my first VR headset. The comfort level is about what I expected: it feels a little awkward, but not too bad, somewhat like a motorcycle helmet. The foam is soft, thick, and comfortable on my face. Adjustable straps on the sides and top (three total) are well-made and easy to adjust to suit my preferred snugness. Still, I am well aware that I have a computer hanging on my face.

After about 60 minutes, I started to feel pressure soreness. Perhaps I have the straps too tight, but when I loosen them I fear that the headset may become unstable (shift on my head) if I jump around too much. There is definitely a trade-off here between facial comfort and tightness/stability.

I wear prescription glasses. Quest includes a ""spacer"" you can place under the foam to create more space for glasses, and this worked well. My glasses did not interfere with anything.

I never noticed any heat from the system, and my face never felt overheated, stuffy, or sweaty.

GRAPHICS: The graphics look good, but not jaw-dropping. It feels like a 720p HDTV... plenty of resolution to create impressive visuals and details, especially with cartoony-style environments, but not enough pixels to make you forget you are looking at a video screen. Most importantly, motion was always smooth. I never noticed any stutter or framerate issues. Even fast-moving objects look great, with no ghosting or stuttering.

CONCLUSION: Although the visual resolution feels a few years old, the frame rates are smooth, the system stays cool to the touch, and there are no wires to limit your motion. Super easy to use, perfect for travel and sharing. I am completely satisfied. Buy it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I've honestly had as much fun with this thing as my Switch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's obviously not as powerful as the Rift or the HTC Vive, but then again, those cost hundreds more for the goggles alone and require a powerful computer behind the goggles to get the full effect.

Bottom line is that, for the price and the convenience of true cord-free operation, the Oculus Quest cannot be beat.

The responsiveness of the controls is perfect.  No lag, and the control feels completely natural.  The built-in proximity cameras work flawlessly.  You draw your open space and it will put up a virtual mesh wall when you get too close so you won't trip over anything (if you've drawn the open area correctly, of course).

The free apps that are available are excellent at showing off what the device can do.  Playing with a little strange dino-alien pet, playing catch with it, scratching its belly until its leg kicks is just wonderfully fun.

Watching a movie on Netflix while increasing the size of the ""screen"" until it looks like you're in one of the front rows of a theater is a great way to watch a movie.  With earbuds in it becomes a completely private experience that won't bother anyone else around you.

I find the goggles comfortable for long sessions.  It takes a little bit to get the tension just right on the straps, but once you do it's very easy to wear without discomfort.  The images are very clear and in-focus even for my less-than-perfect eyes.

If you've been waiting for VR to become worth it, this is the time to jump in.  A great selection of paid apps with more coming, being able to watch incredible 360 videos from YouTube (check out Angel Falls... omg just awe-inspiring), and just having fun without a hassle makes this totally worth the price of admission to the world of VR!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Unfortunately when I have owned two Quests for less than a month and in both cases the controllers malfunctioned, then I have a hard time giving it a favorable rating.
First Quest, the controller started vibrating uncontrollably and nothing seems to resolve the problem.  The Quest controller also before that seemed to have a lot of problems with tracking.  It lost the tracking a lot in the middle of games.  With the table tennis game, it causes you to lose four or five points almost every other game.  Now it's lost connection with the left controller altogether.  The games are entertaining even though they are very subpar.  I don't think honestly very much forethought was put into the design of the Quest especially saving games to the cloud like on XBOX ONE.  I can handle the graphics being not up to the standards of XBOX ONE, but not providing any avenue to have more available memory or access to a drive on Wi-Fi seems unacceptable.  I had a ticket in to get my controller problem addressed.  It was very disappointing considering that I was happy enough with the Oculus Go to move on to the Oculus Quest.

The Second Quest, I returned my first Oculus Quest and opted to get a replacement one hoping that would resolve the controller issue assuming that I had received a defective controller.  Normally, what I have come to find out is that usually if a product you receive is faulty, then it isn't the proverbial lemon products because bad products are usually indictive of the entire batch of products.  They are normally just a product with a defective design.  In spite of my better judgement, I decided to give the Oculus Quest another chance with the second one.  Unfortunately, the second Oculus Quest worked alright for 19 days before the right controller stopped tracking.  I should returned the first one and not wasted anymore time with a defective product line, but unfortunately I wanted the Quest to be the next step in virtual reality, an upgrade and much more technically advanced offspring of the Oculus Go, that I ignored what I knew was most logical choice and purchased a second one anyway.

After talking with Oculus Support twice for two broken controllers, the only option that they give me is a factory reset to fix both controller issues.  The problem here is that I lose any game saves that are not cloud based.  I bought a lot of games and only one of them is cloud based.  This for me is an unacceptable resolution to a controller being broken.  I have setup a return to Amazon for my second Quest now and will be returning and purchasing a PSVR2 instead.  I will have to see how the game refunds go to determine if I ever will consider buying another Oculus product in the future.  The quality of the Quest is very detrimental to considering them in the future but if I get a full refund then I would still consider an Oculus product in the future.

They denied my request for a full refund on games based on a defective product.  I have responded letting them know that it is my right to return all software for a defective computer product according to federal law and the Federal Trade Commission.  I am waiting on their response but next step will be contact the FTC to get the problem resolved then possible my lawyer.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Simply amazed.","May 22, 2019","Ok, been waiting for this to be released for over a year.  Amazon got it delivered to me on the release day.  When I opened the shipping box last night I was amazed at the slick packaging.  Beautiful.  When you open the well made box and see that beautifully finished piece of tech it is even more impressive.  There is not much documentation on how to get started, so i plugged in the super long usb c cord, removed the cardboard insert over the lenses advising you to download the Oculus App and put them on .  The first display you see also tells you to download the app.  I already had it from my Go so I opened the app, hit pair new headset, chose oculus quest from the list of possibilities and entered the code being displayed on the screen of the headset.  At that point the headset walks you through the next steps of setup.  When the initial demo began I was very happy to see that the Oled screen lived up to my hopes.  The resolution is excellent compared to the go or the gear vr, the blacks are now actually black!!  The headset straps are more rigid and easier to get on your noggin.  I put the eyeglass spacer in right away even though I don't wear glasses.  It seems to hold the headset at a distance my eyes like better.  The controllers are fantastic.  They are well made, well thought out and beautiful to look at.  This whole system is beautifully made.  I spent a couple of hours last night experimenting with them in the basement.  One of the things it teaches you right away is how to set up a guard area.  This defines your playing space and alerts you when you are getting out of it.  It never once let me stray out and hit something.  Simply amazing for a self contained system.  One of the first things I found was that a lot of the apps you have for your Go aren't available on Quest.  Like Pigasus, Endspace, Gunjack, BlazeRush, Daedalus, Oculus Rooms, Eclipse and others.  I was a little disappointed by that.  It would be nice if the Quest could dumb down enough to play the Go titles I like so much.  Even the oculus video app behaves differently.  There doesn't seem to be any way to play your purchased Oculus store movies in this app and the theater environment is sadly gone.  I was really looking forward to being able to use that environment again with the true blacks offered by the Oled screen.  Now remember, this system is only a day old and all of this may be resolved in future updates.  Also, Bigscreen is available but crashed every time I tried to enter the lobby.  While a slight bummer, these issues don't take away from the fact that this is an awesome system.  I bought Vader Immortal and discovered that this headset will download far faster than the Go.  Vader is over 2 gb and downloaded in only a few minutes.  If the initial demo the headset ran you through amazed you like it did me, Vader will blow you away.  I wish I had a video of me thrashing around in the basement with a lightsaber only I could see.  If you want to calm down and just watch a movie or something, then right now the Oculus Gallery app or Skybox appear to be your best option.  Skybox works as great as it does on the Go but oddly seems like an earlier version, it isn't quite as fast as the Go version when listing content from a network.  The cool thing about the quest version of Skybox is you can actually walk around the initial ""lobby"" area.  You can also walk around in the theater, but if you turn around and look back towards the projection booth the seat backs are now transparent.  Not a problem, just a glitch that being able to move around has created.  The initial ""living room"" that you have as your home environment is beautiful and you can walk around that too.  If you choose something from the oculus gallery app, it will play on a screen in that environment.  The only thing I have found that I could really consider a glitch is once in a while you see little sparkles of light in certain circumstances.  Not sure if that was defects in a 360 video I was watching or what the cause was, didn't see it enough to be able to pin down exactly when or why it happens.
The built in cooling fan makes a slight background noise that didn't bother me at all (I wasn't even using earbuds).  It does it's job too, after two + hours of hard use it never got warm.  The only problem I had with the headset was the center of my forehead began to hurt after those 2+ hours.  That might be solved by more tinkering with the straps.

Is this worth buying?  Hell yes.  If vr trips your trigger like it does me, then it's a no brainer.  I got the 128gb version and would recommend it.  Everyone says ""oh, 64 is enough.""  I said that with the 32 gb Go and have always been pissed.  The apps for this headset are bigger and I would urge you to consider it.  I don't think you will ever wish you had less storage.

Enjoy everyone and thank you Oculus, I don't think anyone else can stand up to this amazing piece of tech.

Update 10/16/19  One thing that disappointed me when I got the quest was that the apps I really enjoyed on the Go didn't work on the Quest.  They have taken steps to fix this.  If you have purchased an app on the Go or Gear that has a version for quest, you can get a free upgrade to the Quest version.  I have gotten angry birds, endspace, starmap, gun glub vr, ultrawings and wander all downloaded on my Quest now and I am even happier with the system.  In addition, certain Go games can be played in their original form on the Quest now, such as Daedalus, which I am also happy about.  If you look in your library, you will see Quest up at the top with a drop down arrow.  If you click on that arrow, you can choose Go Apps that you have purchased and are playable on Quest.  This is all a big step forward.  You still cannot play movies on the Oculus Video app that you purchased from the store on Go or Gear, but hopefully that is coming.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Also, freedom from wires and not having to connect to a computer is how all VR headsets should be. This headset exceeded my expectations. Many free games available, and others range from $5 to $30. I bought the 128GB since storage is not expandable. 64GB would work too since you can always redownload games if you run out of space. Most games don't take up too much space either. Few improvements could be made: Takes a little adjusting to get the headset comfortable on your face. Battery life could be better.

I'll make a comparison to the Oculus Rift at the end for those who have one and want some point of reference.

Here's the quick and dirty of it:

Fantastic product for a mobile device.

The headset tracking is spot on. Controller tracking is good enough for even pickier users, but should feel great for everyone else.

Audio seems like TV speaker quality, but if it were in a surround sound setup; amazing sense of direction, but low quality sound. Volume levels are good.

Display is clear and crisp.

I did have a few minor issues with controller tracking so far. Guardian boundaries (what prevents you from hitting a wall, etc.) are a little too sensitive, so it's always popping up. A few minor visual glitches seem to occur in the form of tiny white, sometimes colored, lines appearing. The static foveated rendering technique (lower rendered resolution near the edges of your view) used in some experiences (i.e. Vader Immorta) can be a bit distracting at times. This is all really minor stuff though, and shouldn't take away from the experience at all.

Overall an amazing device for VR on the go or even just something light weight for home use.

For those who have or have tried an Oculus Rift and want a point of comparison:

Compared to my 3 sensor Oculus Rift, the Quest has its pros and cons. The Quest controller tracking definitely leaves a bit to be desired. The default Quest audio quality is definitely a major step down. Resolution is a definite step up, but I still get some god rays and screen door effect. No sensor setup can be a major plus for many users, but I personally never minded it (the Rift sensors setup just like my surround sound speakers, so it wasn't much of an issue). The Quest is a great secondary device for current Rift users or as a PC VR alternative if you want a bit lighter weight solution.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

And there are no wires to get in the way, no extra PC to buy and maintain, none of that.  I do wish we could download games to our phone and then to the headset via bluetooth though.  It downloads via Wi-Fi, and for those of us who are truly wireless that consumes bandwidth from our monthly hotspot allowance.  Oh well, not too big of a deal.  The largest games I've seen are about 3GB.

Beyond the freebies that come with the device, I have tried Anne Frank house, Beat Saber, Moss, Apex Construct, and The Wizards.  Each of them is great in visual detail and immersion.  I'm hoping for a D&D / Skyrim type game with third person control, like Moss, and lots of puzzle solving.  I firmly believe that cordless VR is the future of gaming and probably design modelling and build instruction (think ""how to assemble a complex part"" being shown to technicians in VR, allowing them to manipulate and assemble/disassemble virtual products.

I like it and highly recommend it for others.
It has very good graphics, responsiveness and thoughtful ergonomics.
The integration with the internal cameras and controllers and play area is very well done.
Support on the couple of issues I ran into has been helpful and have been professional and willing to go the extra mile. I can't say enough good things. I trust Oculus and feel comfortable working with their product, even though I do not use and am not a fan of FB.

Pros:
Wireless
6 DOF and controllers
Games play well
Guardian system can remember all you different areas.

Cons:
Graphics supposedly not as good as Rift S tethered. More than made up for by the wireless freedom.
Not as many games as the Rift S - that should change
First one of its type.
Some games do glitch occasionally and some games are prone to ""false positives' of the Guardian system
Headset is heavy
2-3 hours of play time - but can run with it plugged in to a battery pack","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Let's talk about the bad first.
VR inherently has some issues. The biggest is that you're strapping a computer to your face, and your face wasn't designed (or evolved) for that. Because of that, my forehead was feeling a bit of a pressure headache after about an hour and a half of play. However, that is a problem you're going to see on every VR headset, and is in no way unique to the Quest.
The other big problem with VR, is most people don't have an open space in their house/apartment big enough for VR, so you're going to have to move some furniture. This may not be a big deal for some, but I was surprised on just how much room you really need for VR. I moved all the furniture out of an 8x10 area, and I was still running into the boundaries every now and again.
Let's talk about the awesome.
The hand presence is incredible. It's not just hand presence, it's finger presence. The controllers are sensitive enough to feel when your fingers have just grazed the buttons or triggers, and show your fingers, in game, to match to that. It's so impressive that you really lose yourself in the world. There is something magical about that moment because everything just intuitively makes sense. It's so much fun.
The tracking is way better than it should be. There are no external trackers like you would see with the Oculus Rift, or VTC Vive. All the tracking is done with the four front-facing cameras. So you would think that as soon as you hand goes out of view of those cameras it would lose it, but it doesn't. When playing games like Robo Recall, where you grab guns by reaching behind you (outride of the view of the cameras) the Quest flawlessly knows what you're doing.
Speaking of those front-facing cameras, the guardian system is excellent. You can redraw your play space anywhere, but better than that, when you move beyond your place space you see a black and white version of the world. This has already been helpful when I need to just quickly grab my phone from the other room. I just exit the guardian boundary and I can walk around as if I wasn't wearing the headset. This may also be useful if you want to go from room-scale play to sitting down to watch a movie or Netflix. You can navigate to the couch and resume, all without taking off the headset.
The best part of the Quest though is the price. This is an incredible level of VR all without buying an expensive PC. I am blown away.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Andrews Jr.","Not perfect but I do love it.","June 4, 2019","I have a PSVR, but wanted this to play some of the exclusives on the Oculus. I love that this is wireless, and I literally sit for hours just messing with it. I love the Netflix app, the games are great, the ease was awesome.

The bad is that there is a huge gap around the nose piece. No one seems to be talking about this, but it's a huge distraction especially since you need to use this in the light. (I ended up stuffing some tissue paper in the gap, and it helped ALOT. So I guess that is a tip for ya'll)

The controllers are great, but they are light. I'm used to having a controller having a little weight to them, so that was noticeable, but other may not notice.

Also, another huge issue is that there is a ""reflective"" effect when playing some games. It really noticeable when the light hits the lenses at a certain angle. I can literally see the circles in the eye piece. It takes you out of the game every time.

However, all in all I do really enjoy the purchase and don't regret it. I'm excited to see the next version come out that is not only more powerful, but fixes some of these issues. A lot of the games I got for PSVR, and most likely won't be rebuying them. So in that respect the selection is kinda slim.

If you don't have a VR system I would 100% recommend this. You don't need anything else. If you have a PSVR I would also recommend for the exclusives and the wireless features. Other than that you might want to do more research. Good luck!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

What a thrilling time this is.

The Quest for me was worth every penny after experiencing it, shortly put if you want freedom of movement and always have a good immersive VR experience at a great resolution this is THE headset to buy, only thing to consider is you trade off freedom of movement and portability at the cost of super HQ graphics, which, to be clear, does not reduce the great experience in the games so far if done right by the devs, the trade off is noticeable in details like reflections, amount of objects in scenes, particle effects, things like that.

So if what you are looking for are stunning graphics. at this point in time the Rift S would be your best alternative IF you have the video card and PC to support it, if not, dude (or dudette) go for the Quest you wont regret it, it's a blast.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The one thing I hated about the Rift set up was the wires and all the sensors that needed to be plugged into my limited USB port computer.
None of that mess with the Quest.
How they managed to squeeze out the graphics they did from the snapdragon processor is baffling.
This thing is just as good as my Rift graphically, but i can go anywhere with it.
I'll let that sink in, this $399 (I have the $499 128GB version) mobile VR Headset is just as good as a $399 Rift with a 2k gaming laptop.
On to the specifics:
Build Quality 5/5
This thing feels solid, and the materials make it feel like a premium piece of tech.  The soft fabric of the actual device and the straps that hold it to your face are all well made and comfortable to use.
Graphics 4.5/5
As I said above I am very confused as to how they got this to look so great!  I took a half star because of small amount of screendoor effect (where you can see the pixels) but that is not as bad as the aforementioned Rift.
Sound 4/5
The device comes with audio that is piped down the straps into your ears.  It is open and just a tab tinny.  It does not come with headphones (though it does have 3.5mm sockets for your own) but I think they could have thrown in a cheap pair so it loses a star for that.  Overall the sound is good considering it is not via a headphone.  Also anyone near you can also hear what you are hearing.
Tracking/Processing 4.5/5
I bundled these together, the Quest uses inside out tracking which means it has to see the controllers with the cameras on the headset.  It does sometimes lose tracking in low light, which I believe is a known thing, just turn up your lights in the room and it is fine.  Surprisingly good at guessing where your hands are if it loses them (behind your head  for example when serving in Sports Scramble).
Software 5/5
I'm going to start by saying I have only a few titles but the launch line up is pretty solid.  Sports Scramble was surprisingly fun (until I punched a light serving lol), Robo Recall looks very similar to the Rift version and is equally as fun, I also bought Vader Immortal but have not had a chance to play it yet.  Netflix works great, it had a bunch of other apps but I did not try them all.  A surprisingly fun title was the First Steps tutorial, most tutorials are pretty dull, but this one was actually engaging!

Overall I really liked the Quest, the freedom of no wires along with spot on tracking (in good light) and the ability to go anywhere with it make this a great VR Headset.  The fact you can also Cast what you are seeing to a Roku (which I don't have so didn't try) or a Phone is pretty awesome and stops your VR sessions being a very lonely event!
One other thing I forgot to mention is that you do need the Oculus App on your phone to make the Quest work, not a problem for me but worth mentioning.
I will update more as I get more hands on time.  But right now it is a pretty sweet device!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Churchill","The new standard of VR","June 22, 2019","There isn't much I can say except that this is one amazing device. It's not perfect, but I'm incredibly impressed with the amount of thought that went into it. I've bought most of the software titles on the store and they are very interesting. One thing that I found surprising is that I don't feel that much more immersed in a game with the Quest as I would be just playing on a flat screen monitor. It's just a different way of interacting which occasionally gives me (not unpleasant) feelings of vertigo.
One thing I should mention is that I think the Quest is not very good with glasses, even though they took steps to accommodate them. I am somewhat nearsighted and have small lens glasses, but they get shoved up against my face and are not very comfortable. However, I find that I can see about as well without them on as I can with them while wearing the Quest. I'm hoping that as the resolution of future VR screens increase and blurriness becomes an actual problem as it is in real life, Oculus can let me fix some of my nearsightedness with an adjustment control for the lenses.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

THIS IS IT.  It's finally arrived.  The quest (I got the 128 version) is completely self contained (although you really need a smart phone or PC to get started, after that the phone and PC are not needed).  It's wireless and you don't need a computer to run it.

You start out by pairing to your smart phone.  This took me about 10 minutes to pair and get everything set up on my home wi-fi etc.  You will need some wi-fi for updates and to down load your games.

Once the initial setup is complete, you don the headset and pick up the hand controls.  Donning the head set is quick (you can pass from person to person easily) and it's mostly comfortable and lightweight.  You then see a black and white image of your room and play area (you may have difficulty playing outside as the sun confuses the sensors).  You ""paint"" your play area in the virtual world.  The Quest will keep track of your position and warn you when you get too close to the boundaries.  This is pretty cool because while in the virtual world, you can stick your head out of the  safe area and look around at your living room - it's like sticking your head through a magic portal - cool.  Your safe area remains memorized as long as you want, so you don't have to re-paint the safe area every time.

Then you start playing and OOHHHH.  How cool is this?  No, the graphics and frame rate are not the absolute best, but they are sufficient for immersion.  Sound quality is OK.  You can also easily add your own ear buds if you need more bass.  Head tracking is dead on.  Hand tracking is 99% on.  It's true that when you move your hands behind your head, you lose tracking, but it doesn't happen often.  I've played Beat Saber, Space Pirate Trainer, Super Hot, Rec Room, and my favorite so far - Darth Vader Star Wars thingy.  If you let your imagination go just a teeny weeny bit, you really believe that you are there, on a space ship, watching Darth Vader stare down at you and wag his fist in your face.  Can I tell you I was intimidated?

I can't play for more than 45 minutes or so or I get a little eye strain.  Battery appears to last 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  Be prepared to spend another $100 or so on games; there is very little for free other than short demos.

Also, many of the games actually make me sweat and I get slightly winded from the exercise.  It's about equivalent to power walking.  It's not a replacement for going to the gym, but it's a lot better than just sitting in chair twitching your thumbs.  Don't even try playing in ""seated mode"".  The beauty of this is that you can jump around your room and dodge bullets and swing light sabers etc. etc.

This is going the be the Atari 2600, VHS, XBOX, DVD player of the future.

The only downside is that it is a little heavy but as it's the first 6dof mobile headset I'm willing to forgive that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I had seen a few youtube videos and thought it looked fun, but never had a gaming PC. When I saw the quest was stand-alone I figured this was my chance and was pretty excited to finally try VR out. Turns out I had no idea what VR was really like. All the youtube videos didn't even come close to doing this thing justice. I have been utterly blown away by how amazing an experience it is to play a game on the Quest. Using the quest I never forget I'm in a game, but I absolutely forget I'm in my living room. Having this things be stand-alone and wireless really helps too. The setup was trivial, and the games (superhot, I expect you to die, journey of the gods) are so much fun. I know the graphics aren't as good as PCVR, but that was never an option for me and I haven't felt let down by the graphics yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Not having Facebook account, it is a bit difficult to enjoy stuff such as Oculus Venues, but otherwise, no complaints. Great for entertainment and fitness (I am not a fan of gym, but when my mind doesn't know it exercises, I love all kinds of movement, Quest helps a lot).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Being wireless, easy to set up and totally portable makes a huge difference in how you play and relate to virtual worlds. I find the image quality to be excellent and use it to watch Netflix and my own collection 3D movies in perfect comfort without bothering anyone around me. Being able to play in the large area of my garage makes all the difference in feeling like you are in an almost unrestricted virtual world.

The selection of games and experiences are also first rate and experiencing  ILMxLAB's Vader Immortal is worth the price of the headset alone and shows what the future of interactive entertainment has in store for us. Another favorite experience is creating artwork with Google Tiltbrush as being untethered makes a lot of difference in working on your artistic creations. Although the graphics on the Quest are not as detailed and refined as you can get with a high end computer with a beefy graphics card you will soon forget this when involved in an exciting game experience. I have also been using this terrific headset to enjoy and share 360 videos and 180 3D videos and pictures taken with a Vuze XR camera. This is the perfect platform for enjoying these new VR type cameras like the Vuze XR and Insta 360 EVO. Truly amazing.

So the bottom line if you have any interest in trying out the VR experience now is the time to jump in with this great  new product from Oculus. The price is right and the software is here with more on the way. It will change the way you play video games as I find it hard to go back to a 2D monitor and mouse after BEING in the game using both hands and 6 degrees of freedom. And who wants to just look at a picture you've taken in an album when you can re-experience the setting of your photo just as you remembered it. I highly recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This means it shows up near the center of the wearers view.

It's my second VR headset with having a Google Dream prior to this. The Google headset is no comparison to this. The battery life isn't what I'd like but I use it almost daily. I went with the larger memory size so that I wouldn't have to uninstall games/apps as new ones become available.

Since the Oculus Rift existed for a while with pretty good reviews and as I watched some videos of the Oculus Quest, I decided to jump on the chance to get this device on release date.

I was not disappointed.  While the library was small at the time, Beat Saber became an instant favorite.  Shortly after, I have learned of way to sideload new songs as well as software that is not available in the Oculus Store which has expanded its use tremendously.  If I had a higher end computer, I would also be streaming titles from my Steam Library as well.

The build quality is great and the only minor gripe is the foam padding for your face.  For extraneous games which get you sweating, the foam padding just soaks it all in which is not great if you want to share the device.  So now I have resorted to wearing a headband and face mask to help with that until my order for a new cover from vrcover.com arrives.

Overall this is an amazing product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

System","October 7, 2019","There is so much to love about the Oculus Quest that puts above other V.R. systems. The ability to play V.R. games without being tethered by a cord or P.C. hives the Oculus Quest more freedom than its sister systems. The controllers work well, with the hand tracking movements and the soon to be hand tracking movement without controllers.

The only downfall of the Quest is the store. Due to its portability and not needing a P.C., the store is limited to some games of quality, but not all. Although you can run Steam games through a work around of the system, it becomes a hassle and this the need for a P.C. that can run V.R. games returns.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was considering a few Windows MR headsets at the point were they announced the RiftS and the quest. I Thought of getting both and  gifting one to my brother. I have used it for around a month now and i got to say am amazed by what the mobile chipset can pull off. Dont expect the graphical quality of the rift S with a good graphics card. But wireless and don't have to turn on the pc is a more appealing thing than you know before the quest gets into your hands . The best part is watching netflix on the go or at home when you want to chill in bed and playing beatsaber and dance central anywhere.. Vader Immortal is an icing on the cake if you are a star wars fan. I would call this a must buy. BUUUUUT  if you have a good PC go for the rift S. I Was amazed by the simplicity and function of the quest but the rift S grew to my liking and now i mostly use the Rift S .The quest is more of a party fun gadget and this makes cross buy games worthwhile.. Otherwise the same games are way cheaper in steam. Well if you have the money buy both. IF you dont have another VR headset that is .. IF you do get the quest as its fun. IF you dont and can only buy one Rift s is my recomendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

By far the most important improvement I've seen is in the overall end user experience. On the PC side, I had to constantly deal with hiccups when switching between multiple VR apps, usually requiring a reboot after one or two sessions, not to mention being tethered to the PC.

With the Quest, the closed ecosystem produces a smooth, mostly trouble free experience, even when quitting and loading VR apps, back to back. Best of all, the headset itself powers on very quickly.

There are a few cons. Battery life isn't great. Usually a couple hours. You can play with the system charging, with of course, the downside of being tethered to the USB C charging cord. The speakers on the headset leave a lot to be desired, though it does have a 3.5mm audio port on both sides of the headset, giving more flexibility in your headphone setup.

Bottom Line:

I'm having a blast playing VR untethered with graphics that come surprisingly close to PC level, in a small package that you can take with you, that boots up quickly, with stability I wish I had on my PC VR's setup.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

For your mental and physical health :)","November 17, 2019","I've had this product for 5 months now. I love it! It is an amazing gaming/ entertainment system! It is totally immersive and the best way to play games, exercise, and watch movies. The free Within app provides high-quality HD videos where you can take a tour of the White House with the Obamas, climb a New York City Bridge with the NYPD Rescue Team, go for a spacewalk, and so much more! With other free apps I attended a live Tenacious D concert (Oculus Venues), took a tour of the Anne Frank House, watched Amazon Prime and YouTube videos (on a sixty foot screen!), and flew to the moon (Apollo 11 Quest). Other free apps include Bait (fishing), BOGO (virtual pet), Epic Roller Coasters, and much more! If you still need more reasons to order this incredible system, here's one big one - you will lose weight and get in shape! My three favorite games for sweat-inducing exercise are Pistol Whip, Racket NX, and Beat Saber (check out the loads of fun folks are having on YouTube with these great games - and the three boxing apps). My other favorite games are Vader Immortal, Racket Fury: Table Tennis, Moss, Superhot VR, Robo Recall: Unplugged, Red Matter, and Space Pirate Trainer. Whether it's heart-pounding action, problem-solving, or adventure games (or a combination of the three!) this all-in-one VR system has it all! Do yourself and your family a favor and order Oculus Quest today - and remember you could file this under Fitness Expense!

I suspect that if you're reading this you're deciding whether to get Go or Quest. Here are some things better on Go than Quest:

Many more apps.
You can rent videos, including 3D movies. Though not enough of those.
It is a good amount cheaper.

Things that are better on Quest than Go:

6DOF. The Quest can scan your room as a way to tell where you have moved to. Some other PC based headsets need transmitters placed in your room, to detect where you are. Quest reads your room, and you can walk around as part of the game play. It is done in a very neat way, and for apps such as the Anne Frank virtual tour, available on both headsets, being able to walk around and lean over to see a different view adds a lot.

Less steaming up. The Go lenses cloud up very quickly. That happens less with Quest.

Two controllers. Perhaps 90% of the time, one controller would work well, but for shoot 'em up games, two guns is better. Some games make good use of two controllers to manipulate things.

Auto power off. To be fair, I need to fire up my Go and see it this feature got added. A recent feature in Quest is that you can set it to turn on when you pick it up, and turn off when you haven't touched it for 15 seconds. That's how I work with it, and the battery can last a couple of days between uses.

Resolution. This is a minor step up from the detail in Go, but at the borderline of what makes it be seamless. With Go it's perfectly good enough if you're engrossed, but you see pixels easily if you look for them. With Quest you need to be looking for pixels. If you are, you see them. So stop looking for them!

Short version of all that, Go is great, you will love it. Quest is better, other than the lack of movie rentals and number of apps. If you're not considering the price as much as the features, I would choose Quest, and hope that the number of apps and videos increases.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

And yes it is a game changer.

The best thing about this Oculus Quest VR headset is the combination of great capabilities (close to the HTC Vive) BUT with full portability. This is a winning combo for me and probably most people.
The oculus Quest can be played sitting down, standing still or moving around. You decide.
The Quest feels and looks a little like the Vive but unlike the Vive you wont need a computer, or cords, or the location “antenna cubes”. And yet you have full freedom of movement 360 degrees. You define your own boundaries easily and real-time by “drawing” a line around you.

I’m sure there will be many technical comparisons to other headsets but the Quest has enough degrees of freedom to make up for any potential performance differences. For starter the Vive requires a near desktop hefty computer and perimeter defining hardware.
The Quest is totally self contained.
Everything about the Quest is impressive.
From the box it comes packed in (second only to the official optional Oculus travel case) in terms of safety holding all the components in and reusable.

I like The controllers much more than the Vive’s. To Vive users, It may not seem so looking at them for the first time but They feel so natural and intuitive once you are inside VR. They are similar but more compact that other oculus controllers. Make sure you use the straps in the beginning or you may accidentally drop a controller when “dropping” a VR object.
The first thing you should do after charging it is do the tutorials. They will blow your mind.
Your hands will look and feel real. The Oculus Tutorials are really cool and when you play the 4 demo games included you will really have enough to keep you amused for a while before buying any apps. The demos will have you dancing alone or with a robot, boxing a professional boxer, using light sabers to the beat of music, shooting one handgun or two simultaneously and even a long gun weapon (rifle like), etc.
Bottom line whether you have never used a VR headset before or you are an experienced user of what until now was a very good offering (the HTC Vive) you will find this a very satisfying experience.
The number of titles available include free apps like YouTube Viewer, Netflix etc but also inter operative ones, like VRchat (a virtual meeting room), etc.
The paid apps include arcade, racing, role playing, fitness, calming/relax , martial arts, , horror, action, spy thrillers , space games , travel, (including an Apollo 11 recreation), action, brain games and even multiplayer games. Both locally and not.

There are two Quest models the 64Gb and the 128Gb. If you can afford another $100 go for the 128gb model. It’ll hold more apps at once.
Current prices are $399 for the 64Gb and $499 for the 128Gb.

This isn’t the first VR headset and it won’t be the last VR headset ever but this is definitely a game changer.

O yes in case you don’t know Oculus is owned by Facebook. So it does offer extra features if you tie it to your Facebook account but you won’t need to do so. I haven’t and probably won’t in the near future. Although one of the features (VR events like concerts) may change my mind one day but right now I’m doing fine without connecting it to FB. The current FB enabled features are streaming, sharing pics , friends, etc

Recommended accessories:
- the official Oculus travel case (about $40) right now sold out here but I found one locally. It’s compact, and small compared to other alternatives.

- a battery brick charger ( put it in your back pocket with a short cord and play for another 1.5 hrs uninterrupted and unfettered or untethered

- there’s a third party comfortable strap that makes the already comfortable Quest headset even more so for extended play","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's literally all I've been playing since I got it.

Now there are some major cons here so I'll start with that.

Cons:
*Very, very uncomfortable, I bought two aftermarket items to try and make it less so. Total cost was $80 for the two. Spending $80 on top of the cost to make it bearable to use seems ridiculous to me.
*The controls are too small and the wrist straps provide little security. These don't even latch in place. Very poor design, how much would latching plastic piece add to the price of manufacturing? Not much... Also, having to put AA batteries in feels archaic. Haven't had to to this since the Xbox 360...
*Tracking get lost often which for a game like Beat Saber is the kiss of death to the full combo we're all shooting for.
*Streams only to Facebook live.... I get it, it's a Facebook product, who streams gaming to Facebook live? It's all YouTube or Twitch major minute here.
*128 gb storage.... For the high end version. Ridiculously small going to fill that up before I know it and then what? No SD slots no easy way to store games on a USB stick.

Pros:
*It's awesome!!!!
*it's totally portable and you can play vr anywhere. Imagine trying to take your ps4 or pc powered vr to a friends to show them vr.
*When the controls aren't losing tracking they are very accurate.

All in all I'd recommend it if you enjoy vr gaming. Just know the cons going in.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've had it in use for a couple hours at a time (handing it off between people), and had no problems. The comfort is good, although it is a little front-heavy.

I had a fun VR experience from this headset.  It is remarkable that I get this level of immersion from a mobile headset.  Un-tethered freedom is quite exhilarating.  However all this freedom does come with a small price.  The graphics do take a hit compared to a PCVR.  Although it doesn't take away from the immersion and the exhilarating freedom it provides.  Just don't expect realistic PC graphics and you won't be dissapointed.

Control 9
Touch controllers are awesome to use.  There are some tracking issues where you lose tracking here and there especially on certain games like beat saber.  An update is supposedly coming to fix it.

Comfort 7
The Quest headset is a bit heavier than most headset as it is an all in one system and its is front heavy.  The original strap and face cushion is a bit comfortable for most and makes it harder to play for a longer duration.  However there are remedies that can be found in the reddit community /youtube.  There are mods eg. frankenquest, etc. even a halo mod thats similar to the Rift S has been floating around on reddit.

Setup / Sharing
(needs a phone for initial setup and casting)  Casting to the phone seems to be the best way to share your VR experience as theres no hiccups or delays however be aware that some phones like Huawei devices are not supported.  You can also cast to pc via scrpy or to tv via chromecast V3 or Ultra.  I think they have recently added V2.  But be aware that casting is still considered BETA by Oculus and is hard to get any support from them if your device is not yet on their official list of supported devices.

Games/Content 7
There are a few games that are great to start with but most of the games currently available in the library feels like minigames.  However, you can STREAM Steam VR games to your Oculus Quest via Virtual Desktop App (in Oculus Store for $20) or via Free sideloaded ALVR software.  But be informed that experience varies, latency and hiccups abound.  Need a good PC to run as well as 5GHZ wifi connection to stream properly.  I also use my headset to watch 3D movies and now tons of free content from BigScreen (free app on Oculus Store)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The release content is mediocre in size currently, but I'm satisfying with the quality of all of them. There's absolutely something for everyone.

Bloody awesome product and I can’t wait to try more of the MMO and adventure games fully.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Do I wish there were other games for it, yes, but there are a lot of games already. I have a PSVR, OCULUS Rift and OCULUS Quest and each one has its own amazing qualities as well as its own flaws. Overall, I love the Quest...not having wires and sensors that need to be setup and calibrated each time is awesome. Of course the OCULUS Rift has a better gaming selection in my opinion but it also takes a pretty stout PC with a rather robust video card in order to play the games. Since the PC is actually running and processing the game they can have different games that the Quest probably wouldn't be able to process in the built in system inside of the headset. There are quite a few games that are cross play between the Rift and Quest and look almost identically on both. If you are looking for something that is easily portable and still a lot of fun then the Quest is an all around amazing portable but powerful VR headset.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Love VR Again!","October 4, 2019","Hands down the best VR Headset on the market! While the HTC Vive Pro may be better in graphics you just can't beat the cordless part of this! It makes all the difference in the world. I was using a PS4 VR Headset before and I barely used it because the cords were such a pain and the whole thing was really complicated to set up.

This headset is so easy to use. I love watching movies in it and I LOVE Big Screen for chatting with others. Such a fun fun device. I highly recommend it.

The immersive art programs are so fun and the games are great. I have spoken to people in VR that tell me they are in there for hours all day! Crazy! It's like Ready Player One in there!

I just read that they are coming out with an update in November (2019) that will allow you to hook this headset to a PC. That makes this system EVEN BETTER. I can't wait for that as well as the awesome had tracking update coming in December! Buy this! Trust me! You will be happy!

The only issue is that the VR headset is front-heavy and a little uncomfortable. I purchased a different front cushion part here on Amazon for it and it helps quite a bit.

Still give this five stars despite the front-heavy part because you get soooo much with this unit that it more than makes up for the minor uncomfortability.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The lack of wires is great! We also have the PSVR.

It’s super easy to calibrate. I like how you trace / draw in your floor space while in the device. We play in an open area of our living room / entryway and drew in the walls & couches.  It starts to show you mesh walls as you reach the edges of the safe zone. Height adjustment was super simple as well, touch a controller to the ground. The freedom to walk around with no cords to trip over is just incredible. I feel like I’m in the prelude to “Ready Player One.”

It’s super quick to load into a game. When you take off the headset, it suspends. Put the head set back on, and you’re good to go. It saves the floor layout so we don’t have to recalibrate.

One serious flaw for me was the way the Quest sat on my face. I felt like it pulled my lower eyelids down, and I couldn’t get used to it. My husband wasn’t bothered as much. He found a website that sells straps that go over the top of your head as an extra support for $27 including shipping from NZ, and now it’s comfortable enough for me to use.

Playing Beat Saber on the Quest has pro / cons to PSVR. PSVR has controllers that are the right shape for light sabers. The Quest controllers’ battery compartment door pops off easily with the rapid motions for beat saber. We fixed that with a piece of packing tape on each battery door.  PSVR controllers don’t track well if you have light sources behind you, and the Quest doesn’t track well if you do large movements that go behind you or too low. I get a better work out with the PSVR since I can make larger movements. However, my husband has found a way to load a bunch of fan made songs into the Quest version so there’s more music variety. It’s also hard to beat the freedom of movement and speed of starting up the Quest.

I can’t comment to the other games because I haven’t tried them much. I played the Star Wars game for about 10 minutes, and it was extremely immersive. He raves about the games constantly and is always flipping through the store.

My husband has also found a way to use the Quest to stream from his computer. He can play VR games that are not available in the store, probably because the Quest doesn’t have enough processing power. His computer is running them so you can watch what he’s doing from his computer. There is a small lag, but he’s having a blast.

I’m considering buying a second set for myself since this was his birthday present.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sure, you could buy a high-end PC for a ridiculous amount of money, then a headset, then you have to be tethered to the thing by a cable, etc. all for somewhat better graphics.  I have played a handful of games (Beat Saber, Super Hot, Job Simulator, Vader Immortal) and honestly the graphics look amazing.

At this point even if someone gave me a PC VR setup, I'm not sure I'd consider it worth the trade to have to deal with cables, complexity, etc.  I previously had an Oculus GO, which was fun, but would leave me slightly nauseated after a while due to the lack of room-scale tracking.  This fixes that with the room tracking (6DOF).  The graphics are also noticeably better than the GO.

I've heard complaints about the sound, but I think it sounds great.  I honestly think anyone complaining about this device is being very nit-picky and would probably also complain about a cure for cancer.  What Oculus has accomplished here is nothing short of amazing.  This is what I've always wanted VR to be and it's finally happened.

The game selection is top-notch.  Every game I've played so far has been amazing.  I think they made the right choice by being more picky about what is allowed in the store this time around.  I feel like I could buy any of the available games and have confidence that I will enjoy it.

Also, lest anyone think I just haven't tried PC VR, I have.  I've tried the Rift on a very high-end PC multiple times.  It was cool, but the cables were annoying.  With this thing, being able to just walk around the room freely changes the entire experience.

If you're on the fence, I strongly encourage you to just buy it.  You can always return it, but I highly doubt you will.

This has been one of my best tech purchases of the last 5 years.  5 stars isn't nearly enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was happily proven wrong. Every game I try blows my mind on how well they look on such a compact device. The resolution is top notch compared to other PC VR headsets I've tried. On my demo of it which lasted only a minute at a store I noticed some glitches with the hand tracking, but my unit after hours of use I didn't notice a single issue. The interface is super friendly to anyone who has VR experience before and also for those with non at all. My dad who can barely send out an email on the computer was easily able to navigate through the menus of the Oculus Home. They have set the Gold Standard for stand alone VR and if this is first big consumer one out I have high hopes for the future of VR as well as AR. Definitely worth every penny.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If your new to owning a VR headset, this is the best choice out there. It may not have the graphical prowess of the Rift or PSVR, but the better lens and resolution surely makes up for it. Despite the graphical cutbacks with its games, the immersion is definitely there. Soundwise; the onboard speakers are better than the Oculus Go with better low end.
This VR headsets best asset is that it is untethered to a console or PC. With its 6 DOF you can move around the virtual space as much as the real physical room allows you.

Pillay","Best purchase EVER~!","November 7, 2019","Seriously I bought this to play beat saber in an attempt to slim down!
Boy I wasn't disappointed - in 26 days - coupled with some strict diet - I lost 8 Kgs...
And I don't get bored playing it - I must say it exceeds my expectations...
I used to get bored exercising, but with beat saber, the motivation is renewed every day - gotta make a better score!
The immersion experience is fabulous - I've tried other games and it simply fascinating!
Been wanting to get a VR headset for more than a year - but couldn't afford one - specially considering that you'd need a powerful PC to connect it to... but not with the Quest, no! It's an all in one device - No wires... and if you follow Tyco Tech's channel on YouTube - you can tweak it to get the best out of it - cast to your Laptop with no chromecast or additional material - sideload other games that were not meant for the Quest with SideQuest - He explains everything in detail for free...
So like I said, you won't regret it...
The only down point is that the foam that comes with it that's in contact with your face starts stinking after about a month - since if you play vividly like me, you will sweat - and it absorbs the sweat- fortunately there's plenty of replacements for that on the net... again - check out Tyco Tech's channel on YouTube and he's gonna be super helpful!

• Very comfortable on the head as there is an electric strap that goes around your head and one on top. Being a previous oculus owner, it’s like putting on a baseball cap. Overall it’s super easy to adjust and the foam fabric is snugged all around.
• One of the few times I’m glad they still go with a plastic covering. You’re wearing this so the goal is to get it as light as possible.
• Wireless, and…I mention wireless! No wires in any way. No PC’s, just put it on and begin.
• Not disconnections from Wi-Fi, as it’s consistent throughout.
• Oculus once again put some good effort into their built-in speakers. Very loud and immersive, while at the same time being aware of what going on in “your” world.
• The built-in headphone jack is always great if you want to be fully immersed. I have to admit that I use the headphone jacks a lot more than I thought (especially in some horror games).
• For more insight on the speakers, it’s an integrated backward setup. The result makes you feel that the sound is playing in all directions and not just focused on one place.
• The Insight program is AWESOME! I’ve owned previous Oculus and one of the most annoying things is taking off the VR set because the outside world got in the way. That’s losing my VR controller after watching something on the Rift or just hitting the wall. With the new four mounted cameras, the Quest now can show you when you’re about to hit the wall. This is probably one of the best features they put in because now the Oculus monitors all your movements in the real world and just inputs them in whatever game. This is a dream for those who live in tiny/cramped rooms.
• The Insight program basically allows you to play in almost any room of your choosing because it maps out the space where you're at (It’s like setting up a border you can play in). I say this is awesome again because the games you play will now be, somewhat, customized to the space you’re in. Having this feature is such a relief (that includes jumping or crouching, as it will be registered in the game, if allowed.).
• The resolution is beautiful for those who never used an Oculus, and it’s a nice upgrade from the Oculus Go (For non VR users, the overall resolution is an awesome sight. Not perfect, but it’s still great.)
• Gaming setup takes probably 30 seconds. Just pick the game in your library and have fun.
• The app works on the phone and in the Oculus. Newcomers, you’ll most likely buy games using your phone, like going through an app store. They have it on the Oculus, but the phone is a lot quicker to scroll and interact.
• The screen itself is very clean. Just remember to treat it right. One scratch and any game or movie will be wasted since your focus will be on that scratch. Avoid this by putting it in its box (or a case, if you bought one) every time you finished. Don’t just toss it aside.
• The tracking capabilities are spot on when I’m playing a game or viewing a 360-degree video.
• 72Hz refresh rate. Just means that everything is smooth and non-glitchy. It also means less motion blur which that means less motion sickness for those who get it.
• A huge section of games. From the date of my review, 50 launch games for this VR.
• You can not only play games that are made and run from the previous Oculus (I believe only the most recent versions), but you can also be able to play against your friends who only have the older versions. I haven’t tested this layout yet as the only thing close to this is VR poker (which is fun, only if people actually talk in the game!)
• The games I’ve mainly played is so far “Rise to Glory” and “Beat Saber.” The controllers are accurate, the speakers are loud, and the experience is quiet a ride.
• Deleting games is just as easy as starting them. This is good to know because, depending on your games/movies, you may have to do some spring cleaning every now and then.
• I moved to my bedroom to the living room and I found the reconfigure border mapping very quick.
• The Passthrough view is the system that allows you to see your world without taking the set. To me, it’s kinda like a black and white night vision camera when viewing your world through the goggles. The four cameras are your eyes what they see, you’ll see (not perfect, but viewable).
• When you’re about to past one of your play borders, the controller turns red.
• Those who have glasses, the Oculus does come with a spacer for your glasses. I don’t use glasses so you need to read other reviewers who have them.
• Putting the Oculus on it knows when I put it on and will wake up. This is also cool because you don’t even need to press any button to begin. But, to save power, I turn it off when I’m done. The bootup time is short anyway.
• Yes, this is mainly for gaming, but honestly some of my favorite apps are Netflix, Sling, and Oculus’s short videos. Playing Netflix on this is an incredible sight and overall surfing the web and watching live TV on a movie theater size screen is an awesome experience. No glares, no annoyances, no nothing.
• The touch controllers feel very solid, easy to use, a nice click response, and the grip for each button is a great design feature.
• Does come with an extra-long USB power cable so you can still enjoy playing your games while it’s charging.
• The Quest can track up to 4,000 square feet. Something that you should know for those who will be playing in a room bigger than this.
• Great warning singles if you’re about to step out of your gaming borders.
• It does remember up to five different locations that you mapped out when making your border. I only have two locations, but when I put the Quest on in one of those rooms, it instantly recognizes it.
• The VR market is run by Oculus. You think VR, you think Oculus.

Cons and Oks:__________
• It’s expensive for the machine. This is not including any really cool games that you have to buy in the store. Yes, there are some nice free ones, but in my experience the best games you’ll have to pay up.
• The games are not near to PC graphics but I would think around Nintendo Wii style of graphics. Keep in mind it’s still a bump in the previous version and this is an on-the-go type of VR. For great graphics, you’ll need a stronger computer to take on the challenge. Putting something that powerful in a tiny box is not there yet. Overall it’s still good for a casual gaming experience, just not ‘O My God.”
• Battery life is an average, for me 2 hours. Maybe 2:30 if I’m just watching a movie or surfing the web / YouTube. Kind of the same battery life as the Oculus Go.
• VR is still new, so you are limited in the games for playing VR. Since VR is not the mainstream there will be a setback on new games and, as mention before, higher cost to play prettier games.
• You can’t play this outside. The sun is a big no-no for the lenses and cameras, as it will track off incorrectly. But something this pricey you can’t trust the outside world. It’s like walking on the sidewalk with your running PC, or gaming console. Leave it indoors (plus you’ll look like an idiot playing this in public).
• More demanding games will eat more of your battery up.
• Controllers require AA batteries. We live in a battery charging world so why is this even allowed?
• Not only that, but I’m replacing these controller batteries a lot more than I should.
• It’s a great experience to view the VR screen but you must know that it’s nowhere near photo realistic. On a white screen, I can see every little pixel in works. Still a great view, but nowhere realistic, an overall grainy look.
• The built-in speakers are loud but to fully immerse you’ll need headphones.
• I personally notice that the touch controller batter covers are a little loose.
• No tracking data underneath the headset. You need to make sure that the controllers are in view in front of you in order of the headset to track it.
• Any outside light still leaks through the nosepiece. It’s really insignificant in gaming, but watching a movie is a whole other experience. For a movie, I have to turn off the lights.
• Even at 72Hz, you’ll still get a little nauseous. I don’t get very often but I’ll admit playing “Dead and Buried” made feel a little uneasy.
• I was told you won’t be able to play all of Oculus Rift games. That kind of sucks for those who spend a decent amount of money on Rift games.
• A price like this is greater than a PlayStation or an Xbox. Both have hundreds top of the line graphic games and millions of users.
• A couple of times the controllers froze up when I accidentally hit both of them together when playing. I had to pull out the batteries in order for them to work again. Hopefully, this will be resolved with a software update.
• Taking out the Oculus is easy but it’s still large task to pack it anywhere. For example, putting in my backpack does take a big bite out of storage. Note that if you’re planning to give this to someone for a birthday or a holiday, out of state, its best you give them a picture of it and tell them one will be shipped to you. When I got my Oculus Go, I was away from home and it was such a burden to find room when I needed to fly back. The Quest is no exception.
• The concept of portable really means moving it from one room to another. Anything other than that is a significant hassle.
• Any Rift games that have high resolution, if the Quest can play them, it may run at lower resolutions. The reason why is to optimize the lower-powered Snapdragon chip.
• My friend has a big head and was having no comfort in using the Oculus.
• I play for a long time it notices that the straps do make your head itchy.
• You’ll need a phone to initially set up. Really not a big deal in the world we live in.
• Charging fully, without playing takes two hours for me.
• Charging fully, while playing games, never happen to me. In fact, there were some times that I was on 0-1% battery life, and the only reason it was working was that I was charging it at the same time. Playing high graphics games will not allow you to charge fully, but watching movies will.
• IMPORTANT: It does not heat up quickly. This is a major issue for those who live in a cold environment. I discovered this after my second day working the Oculus, but if you live in a cold environment your lenses will fog up almost instantly. Since our bodies create heat, putting on the headset, your eyes give off heat that makes the lenses foggy. This goes away either the temperature outside is warm or the Oculus is warmed up with use. For those who live in cold environments, beware! You’ll need to play either a high graphics game to kill the lens fog or keep breathing on the lenses itself. If you decide to just watch a movie, you may be in for a surprise when your entire screen gets fogged. There is no way around this.
• Looks wise, the Quest’s appearance is almost the same as the Rift.
• Oculus app does allow you to cast on-screen action to a second display, but I notice some lag in this.
• On some high graphics games, the login time does take some time.
• Twice so far I had re-draw my borders in my room as the Quest, I guess, forgot to memorize one of my rooms. I don’t know if this a user error on me or a software error, but it’s worth noting.
• Those of you who used the 2016 Oculus controllers, there isn’t much a change.
• The headset will not sense obstacles on the fly. You need to trust your space.
• The Oculus 360 videos are really simple that even a 4-year-old Oculus machine can run. We need videos that need to fit with the resolution that it’s currently built for.
• Still takes some time trying to find the sweet spot for your eyes. I wish the headset will guide you in finding the correct sweet spot for your eyes.
• Lastly looking through the lens is the same as looking through an old PC monitor. Your eyes start to get irritated after a decent amount of time in. Luckily by that time, the battery will be dead.

Bottom Line:__________

In the end, this is a great VR headset that will be perfect for those who want to get in the VR experience. Please note that this is in no way a replacement for any game console, rather than this is just a new toy. The issue with VR is that it isn’t really popular right now. Not only that but, for me, it does take time to get the VR in use before playing. You have put it on, get comfortable, and make sure that you have enough battery life. Unlike any other console, all you have to do it is turn it on, press play, and away you go. In the end, such a small portable VR does has drawbacks, as you can see from the ""Cons"" above.

The Oculus Quest doesn’t really give us a step closer to a fully immerse experience but it’s still a fun toy to play with. If you have some extra cash then pick it up because it’s a great VR set (The camera system alone is worth the buy.). For those who want to get into VR than this a way to go 100%.

Overall: Excellent casual gaming, great video streaming, and an all right battery system. For the common user this is a great buy, but for those who been here before, it’s a decent upgrade in portable VR.

Hope I was a help you.
Love,
Honest Reviewer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The controllers get slippery after awhile because of sweaty palms, and the head unit is unbalanced which causes the device to feel a lot heavier than initally thought. The glasses input did little for my comfort experience and creates a gap at the nose bridge.

Games are slowly trickling in for this unit, so I wait with anticipation. The most annoying thing is having to sign into apps on your phone or computer with codes that you can only see while wearing the unit...which means you can't see a computer screen or your phone. I would rather sign in with email and pass and then confirm later, even if that meant being unable to use the service until I did so. BUT that is less a unit problem and more of an app developer problem.

The room scaling can be a little wonky, even when manually measuring the space around me, it seems to take in an inch or two from those measurements which can make me glitch through walls and floors in games.

TLDR; Great unit, little heavy, slowly getting new apps/games, room scaling could be worked on. Would definitely recommend to buy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Kauble","Very disappointed. Unit malfunctioning majorly","June 4, 2019","Despite being shut down properly (I owned a Go for a while and am familiar with how these headsets work) every time I plugged it into the charger, it would turn itself back on.  It never charged past 70%. (Probably because it was constantly on). I only discovered this when it had been on the charger for a couple days and I started hearing a buzzing coming from it.  When I picked it up, I discovered it had been on all that time, and hadn’t charged.  When I put it on my head, the vision was shaking real bad and it couldn’t find the hand controllers and the guardian box was jumping all over my field of vision despite me not moving at all.  It also would not respond to efforts to reboot..  and felt hotter than it should.  I am sending it back and going to try one more.  I am super disappointed and I am hoping Amazon is not sending me some kind of factory ‘seconds’ because it wasn’t supposed to come till mid July then suddenly they had one?  I paid 499.00 for this and and annoyed I had to return it.  Im hoping the next one they are sending, will be a brand new one and will work properly.  Otherwise, Im gonna be done and will ask for a refund..  UPDATE. I changed it from 1 to 5 stars to get your attention so you will read the update..  I received the new headset much faster than previously promised .  It was a brand new one and it seems to work MUCH BETTER.  NO issues with turning on when plugged in to charger, battery charging fully and actually lasting longer than my Go did.  And it seems more responsive with no crazy software behavior.  I guess sometimes you just get a lemon.  Nothing is always perfect. Amazon made the return process quick and painless for me and paid for the return shipping.  That’s why I will keep shopping here.  👍","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Company behind it sucks.","June 11, 2019","This device works amazingly for what it does. Untethered, stand-alone VR with 6DOF sensorless tracking provides unprecedented freedom and immersion. Easy pickup and play with almost no setup and everything runs smoothly. It’s truly the VR headset for the masses.

However the company behind it has an ironclad control on content. Developers with well known and well received VR games on PSVR and SteamVR have been denied of publishing their games on the store. No reason was ever given. They also have asked existing developers to *take features away* from their apps. The Virtual Desktop developer added a feature to stream SteamVR games directly to the Quest headset. It works reasonably well and has been well received by the community. However, Oculus has asked him to remove that feature. Again no reason was given but it’s mostly likely such feature presents a conflict of interest against their other products like the Rift S, and maybe their own future streaming solution. Whatever the reason was, such draconian approach is not healthy for a new platform like this. Coupled with the prelaunch “no cross buy” controversy, every decision this company has done strikes me as short-sighted, anti-consumer, and pure money grab.

For this reason, I can’t recommend this headset or their ecosystem at the moment.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Since there are ton of reviews of Quest already, I will only highlight things that were not obvious or found to be an issue when I started using:

- Setup
No trouble to get things running quick and overall has been very smooth experience. You do need smartphone with Oculus app installed and have to initiate setup up from there.

- Guardian
Very intrusive and not able to turn it off completely. Stationary option is awful at the moment with the boundary grid constantly showing up even when you are in the same spot. There is an option apparently through developer menu, but I haven't found way to disable it yet. Also if you want to be able to give the VR to another person with stationary mode, they have to be in the same spot or needs to be re-calibrated every time

- Fit/Comfort
I bought this to not only play games, but also thinking I would be able to watch movies. Unfortunately, I did not find this too comfortable laying on my back with a heavy object on my face for prolonged time. Also there is some light bleed around the noise area and I need to figure out a way to block this out

- Battery life
Getting more then 2 hours, but the ability to plug in external battery pack and put it in the back of your pocket also works great so I don't have concern with short battery life

- Fan noise
You will hear fan kicking on/off in silent surroundings, not a huge deal, but be aware of that.

- Speakers
They are not as good as Rift, but they do the job just fine, although I plan to use external ear buds. I had some crackling noise in the right speaker which was resolve by rebooting the device. Apparently I am not the only one.

- Resolution / Screen Door Effect (SDE)
This is was the main thing that I was concerned about. The good news that it is improved over original Rift, but it's still not good enough for a movie experience. I've tried watching Netflix VR and I was constantly looking at SDE. It's probably would be ok to watch movies if you don't have anything else around, but I wouldn't rely on this as a primary movie watching device anytime soon

- Apps
Very few free experiences unfortunately. I have tried Beat Saber first and I am glad to see the experience is pretty much as the same as on the Rift. There is a lack of Google Earth though which was my favorite demo app, hoping this will get added at some point. Also apps are more expensive which is a bummer, I will be waiting for deals before I would buy any.

- CrossBuy
Having purchased a lot of apps in Rift I am bummed also by limited options with crossbuy. To add insult to an injury they also raised the prices on the popular titles. I'd like to see perhaps not a free option, but a discount for those who purchased on original Rift platform. Specifically Beat Saber and SuperHot.

- Glitches
I have seen ton of a glitches in the apps, like screen tearing, closing apps or even oculus home, as well as speaker crackling noise, so I won't knock down as these will be improved eventually.

Conclusion:
Alright, it's obvious there are some glitches at launch, lack of apps and pricing that they have to work on, but I see this as a glimpse of the future for wireless VR and I'd like to support this technology which will get better with time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The immersion you can feel in a game is incredible and I haven't experienced anything like it before. That being said, I underestimated how much open space I would actually need to where I wasn't constantly hitting the edges of the guardian system. I've also experienced some crashes in games like robo-recall which seem to happen when the guardian system displays the virtual border. Also, I am used to long form console games so transitioning to  VR ""experiences"" has been a bit of a challenge. I've found myself bingeing and beating a game over a couple of hours/days and not revisiting it again yet.
Overall I am very happy with my Quest. I feel like  the crashes I have experienced will get sorted out by future software updates, and I'm hopeful that longer form games will make it into the Oculus Quest store sooner than later.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Update- Now there are 3rd party apps that allow you to play SteamVR games as long as your Computer can run VR.

It was cool, dont get me wrong, but I wasn't very impressed.  Lots of SDE (Screen Door Effect), and graphics just didnt seem ready yet.  Phone heating up and causing a lot of problems after 5 minutes was annoying as well.  Switched over to the PSVR.  It was slightly better, but became aggravating with all of the cables and setup each time.

Came across the Quest a few days ago when I was searching headsets again and was shocked that it was wireless.  So I figured I'd give it a try.

I am completely blown away.  The graphics are way better than the PSVR.  And not having the cables is truly a remarkable step forward.  You can put this on WHEREVER you go without the need for an outside unit to plug into.  Truly incredible.

It's very simple to use, and despite the fact that when I looked at tbe controllers and first thought ""ah, that's a learning curve"", no, they're fantastic.  They're very simple and very fluid.  Almost a rewarding feeling when you are using them.

The detail and feeling that you are RIGHT THERE, is amazing.  I hated the roller coaster program--real roller coaster don't make me queasy, but this did.

I have had the HTC VIVE, after spending thousands to build a state of the art gaming PC, $600 on the Vive, I loved it. I spent another $500 to make it wireless, but still tied to my PC, still only works in the area I setup with the sensors.  Then, I got this. Turn it on and using the controls define the boundary of the play area by painting a line on the ground, that’s it. It needs no PC, no cables, it is completely self contained.
I have games on both systems, many reviewers claim the Quest is not quite as good in terms of tracking or resolution.  That couldn’t be further from the truth.  Not only is it identical, I haven’t had any of the tracking issues or crashing games I had on the Vive. Or issues finding the sensors, since there aren’t any.
You can enable developer mode and increase the resolution, too. It eventually slows the thing down but let’s you see just what it’s capable of, and it’s amazing.  There’s plenty of instructions out there that show you how to play your Vive and Steam games on the Quest, as well as pairing a keyboard and mouse to it.
Besides the incredible games and fun you’ll have, just using the standard tools. I have been using it on long flights. Playing a movie from my phone was okay before, but now with the goggles I am sitting in a full-sized movie theater looking at a full sized movie screen playing my movie, from my seat on the plane. The immersion really helps you forget you are cooped up on a plane for hours and hours.
I bought a compact carry case, and now the VR experience is completely portable.
Pros:
Everything. Hands down the best VR experience available. Sitting gates, room scale games, movies, you name it.  It’s amazing, and you just can’t even imagine the experience until you try it.  I have used the HTC VIVE for years and I can’t stress how blown away I am by this device.
Cons: battery life. I solved this with a 3rd party headstrap, let’s me attach a rechargeable pack I bough for the HTC Vive wireless upgrade. It works for about 4-5 hours of intense use without the pack, maybe more, but can go all day with the right pack. The controllers use AA. I found they could be swapped every week, one per controller. Why these aren’t rechargeable like the Vive, who knows. So I bought a 4-pack of rechargeable and never worry about it.
The last con is personal preference, but I have heard it from others. The faceplate doesn’t cover completely letting light in, and leaving marks on your face. I do suggest investing in a nice padded replacement. But even without it, it’s still 5-star amazing.
If you are in the fence, just buy it. I can tell you that you will NOT regret it. You might regret buying the 64GB option when you run out of space. But because this is not tied to a PC the games are much more compact and streamlined. An 8GB game on my Vive may be 1.2GB on the Quest, and I am telling you they are identical to me, I can not tell any difference.

Opinion:
I have heard people dislike the audio and get headphones. First, I love the audio, I can’t even tell where it comes from, but it sounds good, clear and 3D. However there is options if you don’t like it. Plug any headphone into the jack to use it. Or, enable developer mode and add software to pair AirPods and other BlueTooth headphones. That’s pretty slick, I have to admit the audio and bass with my AirPods is impressive, but most of the time I don’t bother using them, because the built in is really nice for most games.

Suggest you get some micro fiber cloth to clean the lenses if you don't have them. Also not sure Oculus would support this statement, but some antifog solution applied CAREFULLY to the lens is a win.

Highly recommend. This is was a major step toward bring VR to the masses by finally making it easy to use for anyone.

While some games may be graphically underpowered now, games like Red Matter show the potential of the device. I swapped out the default headstrap for the Vive Pro Audio strap (it took two 3D printed pieces to attach) which is much more comfortable. I put an Anker battery on the back which helps balance the extra weight (my only complaint about the Quest) and it extends my battery life.

I sideloaded Beat Saber to get custom songs and have also been able to stream SteamVR games to the headset (with fully working controllers and boundaries). I don't make games, but from what I have seen it is very dev-friendly. There is a tech demo on an unofficial app marketplace called Tea For God which showcases the amazing potential of non-tethered VR. It generates random hallways, elevators, ducts to crawl through, and enemies to shoot as you walk around your playspace. If your playspace is big enough, it feels like you have infinite space due to its use of non-Euclidean geometry.

This is a console and screen all in one, which is a great value. I got the 128GB version and have installed 25 games/demos, using up about 80GB of space. There are complaints about the 2.5-3hrs of battery life, but I'm not sure who can play VR for that long without a break. It's also not an issue with the battery pack.

Stansfield","Fun, but casting issues kind of blowing it for me.","May 31, 2019","The fun of VR for me is sharing what you're doing with the rest of the room. However, you're unable to cast some of the most popular games, including Beat Saber. Nowhere in game listings does it say which games you aren't able to cast, so you don't know before purchase, unless you research every game separately from the store (and even then it's difficult to figure out). It also just doesn't work consistently - doesn't work with certain phones, and sometimes just refuses to connect to Chromecast even though Chromecast is working with everything else.

Additionally, you're using Chromecast, and there's no wired option to cast, so there's a delay in casting. In games like Superhot, this isn't a huge deal (though kind of annoying), however, even if they do fix Beat Saber, you'd be hearing the song twice, a couple seconds apart, and it would be very confusing. I read on forums they were working on a fix for Beat Saber. I emailed their support (I want to know the details, because I might return otherwise), and was told they don't have a timeline for the fix, and he didn't answer my other questions, such as asking for a list of games that don't work for casting.

As for the rest of the headset, they've done a good job. Definitely a big step above the Go. I don't think it's particularly heavy - I find it comfortable (other than I can always see light coming from just above my nose). The battery life is okay - I never play for more than 45 minutes at a time anyways (but again, I might, if I was switching off with a group of people because the casting worked).

AA batteries in the handhelds last about 10 hours of play.

The game choices are somewhat limited, but it did just launch, so I suppose that's expected.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Ease of use is remarkable and the room scaling without any additional signal towers is really impressive. I have a Vive Pro as well for the more demanding experiences like Elite Dangerous. The visual fidelity of the Vive Pro is still far surperior. But the Quest is the perfect living room VR experience that is easy to use without cables and a big PC. Also great: you're able to stream the experience onto a TV screen through Chromecast for other people to see what the player sees.

First before we talk about problems, the product itself was given so much hype that when I first tried it I was actually disappointed. To put it bluntly, it promised more than it can deliver.
Next is the problems, and there are quite few. Let's start with the one thing they promised, tracking.  Contrary to the claim that the tracking is perfect except for the blind spots, it’s actually not.  In reality 20 to 30% of the time I had tracking issues, even though my hands were in front of me or by my side, specially when not moving.
Then there is the black the screen issue, sometimes when I open an app the screen becomes black I’m nothing happens so I have to restart the app again.
Also there is what some calls ""fog"" issue in the middle of the screen. But I actually feel that it is not really fog but rather the pixel are white or bright because of oculus logo.
There are actually other issues like the guardian system isn't actually accurate and it keeps popping up even after turning it off, the distance of the ground keep changing, or how it's so hard to find and adjust the headset to the sweet-spot. But these issues you can work your way around them somehow.
And last point has nothing to do with the headset itself but delivery. When I purchased the headset I was asked if I want to be delivered during holidays and of course I said yes, but then even though my arrived and was ready to be delivered, they told me ""Sorry, sir. We don't deliver on holidays"". Then why would you ask me if I want to be delivered on holidays if you're not working on holidays. Is this some kind of a joke? It was Ramadan, I was fasting and it was scorching hot, I had to go there pick it up my as they told me to, but of course not without all the drama.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Even with the Oculus GO I never had these issues. Everytime you put the headset on you have to reset the guardian. Other issues is that I was only able to see the Oculus home when I first turn on the headset after that if I leave a game and try to go to home I only get a black screen but still able to see the controllers. For me I don't want to have to start every game from the phone but unfortunately that was the only way it would work so I returned mine. Another thing is it's not really that much better in graphics than the Oculus Go, and the library is still very small. The last issue is that if your going to pay that much for mobile VR then you should not have to mode the headset with sideloading to play games from your GO or any other games that it's compatible to. They still have not updated VR Chat or RecRoom and a lot of other games.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

With my Rift, it's always been the come over to my house and shove yourself in my cramped room with cords going everywhere (dont trip please), sure you get the ooooos and ahhhhhs but when you take those same moments but make it wireless, it changes the whole playing field (literally whatever field you want)

The great memories and fun play sessions with friends and family at my home or theirs are cherished moments.

Taking less than 5min. to set-up, a quick Beat Saber session anywhere I want is jaw-droppingly easy and fun too.

Yes the graphics take a hit when compared to PC but in my experience, graphics simply don't matter in VR. I've already tried to lean on a table that wasn't there, a great sign that the VR works.

This is VR’s iPhone moment. The First Steps program where you learn about the VR environment is super user friendly and magical. The graphics are about 75% of what you get on PC VR (which can run in the thousands after you buy a PC, graphics card, and headset). But the freedom of not being tethered by a cable to an expensive PC makes the games more fun and convenient. Throw it in a backpack and bring it anywhere. Setting up in a new room takes a minute. The headset is heavy.

At first I was a little disappointed that the graphics were ""cartoonish"", but once you are in the games, you get totally submersed in the action!  While we have only purchased 2 games, Job Simulator and Super Hot, there are plenty of demos that come with the Quest, my favorite being Beat Saber (next on our list to purchase the full game).

I felt uneasy about spending so much money on something but I did it anyway and haven't regretted it since.
The biggest thing I've learned after buying the quest is to expect to pay more than for the quest itself. If you're not willing to spend an extra 100+ between games and accessories I wouldn't go for it. However a lot of accessories can be 3D printed for cheap, so keep that in mind.
The battery on the headset doesn't last extremely long but that actually perfect because it can get uncomfortable after a long time. You can get/print a headband to add comfort, which helps a lot.

I think at this time most of the electric devices should be chargeable through USB I can’t believe there are using this technology for a vr and the controllers are using AA batteries that’s unbelievable.  For the price I think it should be included in some kind of software to play.  And if you have a previously bought some beer to reality games I think you should be able to play them on this device.

This is the first thing I've ever pre-ordered, It's awesome, I love it, but it hurt my face so I used it for a day and then it sat on my shelf for weeks untouched.

So actually while complaining about just that to a friend of mine, I said ""I'm going to screw it into a motorcycle helmet and see if that works"". I was kidding, but about a half second later I totally wasn't.

Well, I did that. I didn't even have to screw it in. I didn't even have to use duct tape even though I also bought 2 rolls.

I just went down to my local general store, got literally the only motorcycle helmet they had in stock and went home in a vain hope that it would work, but also keeping the receipt.

The exact one I got is a model SH-201 Adult MX frenzy grey/black X-large bar code 70258729950. I can't find it for sure on amazon, but I'm sure there are tons of helmets that would do the trick.

So I get home, rip the box open and try in absolute vain to stretch the occulus over the helmet. No way is that happening. Nope. I screwed off the little wing thing on the top to see if that would help. Still no go. But then I literally just place the straps in through the goggle space into the actual helmet and push the occulus in just enough to get it snug enough to stay (not hard, at all) and then try it on.

Zero weight on your face, the helmet doesn't slip forward, you can even chin strap it in, it doesn't block any of the front cameras, still senses controllers, the speakers function perfectly inside the helmet and you can put on the little chin strap on the helmet to keep it in a totally fixed position if you want.

I may or may not go back and get a snazzier helmet at some point in time that is my actual head size, but I mean, right now any one of my friends could get their heads in it too, so I may just leave it be. I'm sure I'll be experimenting. I might even sew it in. We'll see.

Keep in mind, I literally just got home and tested this like half an hour ago and after excitedly messaging some friends post-success, I got right on here. So this is still in test mode, but immediately beats previous situation.

I was just so excited that I actually get to use it now without face pain that I wanted to share it with the rest of you. Probably will be pulling an all-nighter with this now and I'm thrilled!

Good luck, all!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Some of the games are fun, and the return policy is very generous. I found lack of variety to be the issue here. Every game is either shoot zombies, shoot people, or anything having to do with rhythm. This is NOT what you get solely for gaming. This is more of a console for kids playing games with their siblings. If you don't have friends that will play with you a lot, this might not be that great. Still, this might just not be for me. I plan on purchasing a rift s sometime in the future when I can afford it. Overall, a nice console, but it isn't for everyone. This is probably best for kids that don't have a gaming pc and adults that don't have a gaming pc. If you want to watch movies, either buy an oculus go or buy a TV.

No need for sensors on wall or a computer. My son plays Quest while I play Rift CV1 and we can play together in some games. Battery life is 2 hrs . Compared to the CV1 the controllers and straps feel really cheaply made. Head set feels comfortable enough for 2 hrs. Graphics are great . I would recommend to use head phones for the ones who want a better experience, with out headphones it is lame since you can hear everything around you in the real world. Using them you will be able to hear all the details in the game.
1 flaw i see is in some games if you need to grab items behind back or near face the sensors do not pick up hand controller and it glitches in VR game.
It was worth the buy IMO. Cant wait for more games to come out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Period.","May 28, 2019","There is no other product you can buy that provides so much for VR while asking for so little.  You don't need gaming pc with a giant graphics card.  You don't need to set up cameras.  Turn it on and go.  For ~$400 you can have an immersive high quality VR experience without a single wire.  This is the VR headset that will set fire to waves of people coming to VR.  The library is excellent and the graphics quality is outstanding at this price point.  Very happy with my purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We loved the experience of VR, but the need to maintain a full gaming computer (each), a dedicated space with cameras all over the room, and all of the setup and maintenance we saw behind the scenes at the arcade meant it was out of reach at home. No more! The Quest has a limited selection of games for now (still more than other consoles at launch!), but the VR experience is every bit as amazing and immersive as I remember. Between the two of us and our young ones (BOGO is a must-have if you want to share with small children, and it's free!), our two headsets are in use for hours a day. With no wires and no other requirements, this set is a must-have if you want to finally experience VR at home on a limited time, knowledge, or financial budget.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's just ridiculous how a product this advanced fails badly on something so trivial. The headset is too heavy. Not to cause me back aches, but to stay corrected on my head.
When wearing it, it keeps on falling down, the straps are too smooth. The internet is full of people adding power banks on the back to keep it adjusted, but it surprises me people are fine with that solution. I'm not into adding more weight, the product should be delivered fully prepared.
If I had known it beforehand I wouldn't have ordered it, simply because of it. Sadly i can't return it because I bought it internationally.

Again, as a vr headset it's amazing, so advanced, more and more apps and support, but I can't fit it without tucking something to keep it tight...","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I wish Oculus had a bigger library and that they would put better titles on sale, but this is still my favorite headset.  Compared to the Rift and the PSVR, the ease of use can't be beat. Visuals are better on the Rift, but I'm more inclined to use the Quest since I don't have to waste any time troubleshooting, and the time between powering it on and playing a game is pretty darn quick.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, there was always two primary barriers, price and quality of experience.

Before the quest you had really two options.  You could spend a lot of money on a quality setup with a gaming PC and then create a dedicated space for your VR gaming in 6DOF but you where locked to that space and tethered to it quite literally by cables.
The other option was much cheaper and mobile with 'drop-in' headsets for phones and other similar setups but with no tracking for controllers this was really just a view experience and wasn't all that much fun outside the initial novelty.
Enter the Quest.
This is what I have been waiting for.  A quality experience, with controller tracking, 6 DOF and full portability.  Its perfect for playing, experiencing or any of the above.  I have taken it to work, friends, parents and grandparent.  Literally everyone who tries it comes away with a HUGE SMILE on their face and expresses how awesome it is.  You will consistently hear them saying ""this is crazy"" ""this is so cool"" ""wow, I can't believe how real this feels"".
There aren't as many games as you would ideally want in the long term.  However, I consider this the same way I would when a new console launches.  There are a few titles to start but as the console gains momentum the titles will follow suite shortly.  In the mean time there is plenty to explore.
If you have considered VR at any point.  Wait no longer.  This is what you have been waiting for!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/product-reviews/B07PRDGYTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
