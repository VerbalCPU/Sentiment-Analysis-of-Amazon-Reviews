Roberts","Frustrating - stick with the original Clue","June 30, 2018","This game is no less ""complex"" than the original Clue game, and it's much less fun to play.  It's too easy to accidentally see the clues; they're on the bases of the character and furniture tokens and are visible if (when) one gets tipped over.  I gave it two stars only because there are a couple of situations where it would be more appropriate than the original.  First, a non-reader would be able to play, they just need to be able to recognize numbers for the time element.  Second, it doesn't involve a murder mystery.  The plot of Clue Junior is to uncover who ate the piece of cake at what time and with what beverage.  My son is almost seven, though, and I'm not too concerned that he's going to turn to a life of crime as the Lead Pipe Killer.  In general, I'd pass on this game.

(Tip: if you're choosing this option b/c your child has trouble holding the cards for the regular game, Iook for a card holder for kids - there are plenty on Amazon.)","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Hasbro-Gaming-C1293-Clue-Junior/product-reviews/B01ISKSH2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The purpose of the game is to find out 1.) Who ate the cake, 2.) What time they ate the cake, and 3.) What they drank. You find out 1 and 2 by looking under the suspect/character pieces and 3 by looking underneath the furniture pieces located in specific rooms. There are Time/Drink tiles you shuffle and place randomly under each Character/Furniture game piece so there is a different solution each game. (One Time and one Drink tile go into the middle of the board for the players to figure out by process of elimination and the ""crumb"" tile gets shuffled with the time tiles and randomly assigned to a character who becomes the cake villain). Here is what I think is the biggest drawback - Unlike regular Clue, each player is not supposed to ""be"" a character. Instead, on your turn you are supposed to move whichever character piece you wish. This can cause frustration because you can only look under a character piece by either rolling a white square on the dice, or landing on one of only 3 white spaces on the entire game board. As you keep trying to move specific character pieces to get into a certain room (to get to one of the 3 spots where you can look under them) the other players can also keep moving the piece you need on their turns and it's futile. It makes it really hard to figure out the Who and the Time. This led to us always figure the Drink first and spending the last 2/3s of the game trying to look under the people to figure out the time and cake eater. We modified the rules so each player picked one designated character piece to play/move and when they landed on one of the 3 white spaces on the board to allow you to look under a character, they could look under any character they choose, not just the one they moved. It improved the game greatly. Another small drawback - My four year old LOVES this game, but there are some drawbacks with that too. One of the nice things for small children about this game compared to regular Clue is that the notepad has pictures for each character and beverage instead of text so my 4 year old can play on her own and unassisted check off the items on her notepad using the pictures. The three of us have probably played this game 30x since Christmas, and we are now out of notepads, and guess what - they don't sell any more! So if you plan on this game lasting long term it's not going to make it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","",""

You set it up by putting 1 time and 1 drink (unknown by all) in the middle. Then mix up the rest of the pieces and put the people and room objects in the correct stands and place them in the correct places.  The tricky part for adults is that you aren't one specific player - you can move any of the pieces around.  It can get frustrating when you little one moves someone you have been trying to get some place, but that's part of the strategy too so adults still have to stay on their toes in figuring stuff out.  My daughter is 5 and loves playing this game. She has gotten quite good at her strategy now and often beats me to the punch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Hasbro-Gaming-C1293-Clue-Junior/product-reviews/B01ISKSH2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It was nice to have a kid friendly mystery to solve instead of the murder in the original. The character pieces are fun and the rules easy to learn.

There are 2 downsides:
1) the board needs to be bigger. Pieces were often to crowded causing both the kids and adults to repeatedly knock pieces over when moving another.

2) there are white tokens that you shuffle and put under the characters. They are annoying to try and move with the characters as they are thin and hard to grab. If you flip them and try to stick the character bases into them they repeatedly fall off, exposing the clue if they flip when falling off.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Hasbro-Gaming-C1293-Clue-Junior/product-reviews/B01ISKSH2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

 Bought new was wrapped in plastic and is missing white peices because they where meant to hold characters which are now plastic figures. The idea behind the white peices was to create random play each game but with the new plastic figures with the stickers it creates a bit of a permanent problem as it can no longer be random every game. We will more than likely fix this problem by using pennies. The dice is also missing so we couldn't even play, which was a big let down as this was a gift from my 4 year old daughter to her daddy for father's day. It sounds like Hasbro needs to take these off the shelf make some changes and finish (re)designing their game!

They have changed the pawns from cardboard forms that sit in a base to plastic figures that have their own built-in base.  The problem is that the instructions state that the pawns should be randomly placed in bases with times noted on the bottom of them (using stickers).  Not sure how you randomly assign a permanent sticker each time you play the game.  Elimination of the white bases for the pawns also has resulted in the loss of a die to play the game too.  I've purchased two of these now and both arrived with the same contents, so it seems to be a fault of the game (re)design, not an isolated packing issue.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

So once we realized you move ANY character you want, that's when the game moved faster and more strategy came into play.  Kids loved it, as did I.

I saw this and thought it would be perfect. I was surprised to find all this initial setup required (putting stickers on plastic game pieces, punching out cardboard to assemble other game pieces and having to try and read through the instructions to figure out what stickers go on what). Once we got past that hurdle, then we read the instructions for game play. I have no idea how any child would be able to play this game without adult supervision (even if they can read). We found the instructions to be confusing and decided to just go back to the old version of Clue where people are murdered by other people with actual weapons.
Please note, if you or anyone else playing the game is visually impaired you may find it difficult to determine the beverage that the cookie thief drank. The stickers are in color but quite small and the score sheet is printed in shades of grey.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Hasbro-Gaming-C1293-Clue-Junior/product-reviews/B01ISKSH2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The kids were SOOOO EXCITED when I pulled it out to show them what we got!! It was a tad bit confusing to put the stickers on the chips when getting everything ready to play, but we finally figured it out. After that, it was GAME ON!! My students have never played the original Clue game, so this is a novelty to them! I have played it (my most favorite game growing up!), and, in my opinion, this one compares nicely!! The paper that each player uses to sort the clues out makes each player cross off the information that they discover while playing the game. So, in the end, they deduce who ate the cake, at what time, and what they drank with it. It's very simple to play once you run through a few dice rolls & use the instructions. My students picked it up and are LOVING IT!!! They're using skills (inferencing, drawing conclusions, predictions, critical thinking, and strategies) they didn't know how to do before we started. It's making a couple of them communicate more, and everyone is thoroughly enjoying themselves and their company.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

He asked about Clue and we tried to use the regular version but it was over his head. So we purchased Clue JR as an entry level version for him. There's a set up that took me about 20 minutes and then about 30 more minutes of reading the rules. I had assumed the instructions would be intended for a 5 year old they are overly worded and make the entire process harder than it needs to be. I'm trying to set up a game, learn the game, teach the game and all while my child is insanely excited over me. Most Junior games we have tried have been very abbreviated and require little set up. While the game was fun it caused unneeded anxiety in the process. I would've had an easier time just making up some rules for the regular Clue game and just rolling with it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","",""

It definitely plays a bit differently than original Clue. Instead of cards, you move tokens around the board and the clues are on the bottoms of the tokens. Land on a specific spot, you can look at the bottom (secretly) and mark info off your note pad.

There's less you can infer here. With regular clue, you can see what people have and what they don't based on who shows a card (or doesn't). With this kid's version, you pretty much have to see all the clues yourself in order to figure it out unless you want to make a total guess. That's not a bad thing, it's just less complicated and means games can go on maybe longer than you might anticipate.

The kiddo loves it, though, and it gets her thinking and interacting, which is good.

There are a couple of minor drawbacks that I didn't really deduct points on:

1. You don't move one specific character, you pick any character and move them. This may mean one player spends a turn or two trying to get a character to a specific spot and then some other player ""steals"" it and makes the final move to see the bottom of the character. You can address this with some ""house rules"" maybe or potentially consider it strategy - I can effectively stop you from looking at a character by ""stealing"" it and moving it away from the spot you want it.

2. The characters sit in these little white bases. Each base has the clue on the bottom. You switch up the bases (blindly) each game. However, it can be sort of tough to get the characters in the base, and if you don't get them in exactly they slip out easily, which can cause for some frustration mid-game.

3. It's pretty easy to knock the characters and other pieces over with little arms and hands reaching all over. If you knock one over, you see the bottom... and that's where the clue is. In some cases, ""accidents"" end up amounting to ""cheating"" because it reveals info that shouldn't have been revealed. Once is an accident, two or three times in the same game... hmmm....

In all, though, it's good. I can't wait until we graduate to the original Clue.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Hasbro-Gaming-C1293-Clue-Junior/product-reviews/B01ISKSH2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I want to love Clue, Jr., but they made it more complicated than necessary. Monopoly Jr. rocks - they simplified it perfectly while still keeping the game intact.

First - the setup takes awhile - and the setup is kinda hard to do - think an older child or adult would have to help...each time the game is played.

Second - the game board could be more clean & simple. It's hard to look at - and the multiple spaces inside the rooms is unnecessary. I wish there were just basic blocks - instead of random footprints. And I wish that when you entered a room, you chose to land on a yellow or a white circle in each room. Period.

Third - I wish they included reusable laminated flip up cards with bigger, more clear pictures so you could more easily see the pictures and mark them off with a dry erase marker or washable marker.

This game has potential, but I was pretty disappointed at the details of the board and the play sheets. Who tested this?

It takes a minute to understand that you mark off each room when you visit it on the paper. Doesn't really explain that in the instructions. When playing, you have to find out who has the cake crumb token under them, at what time, and what they drank with it. Also, you have to push hard to get the white tokens onto the characters. It's a fun game that the kids love to play, although my 5 year old does get bored and does something else.
